Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men 
worldwide and causes over 250,000 deaths each year1. 
Overtreatment of indolent disease also results in significant 
morbidity2. Common genetic alterations in prostate cancer 
include losses of NKX3.1 (8p21)3,4 and PTEN (10q23)5,6, 
gains of AR (the androgen receptor gene)7,8 and fusion of ETS 
family transcription factor genes with androgen-responsive 
promoters9–11. Recurrent somatic base-pair substitutions are 
believed to be less contributory in prostate tumorigenesis12,13 
but have not been systematically analyzed in large cohorts. 
Here, we sequenced the exomes of 112 prostate tumor and 
normal tissue pairs. New recurrent mutations were identified 
in multiple genes, including MED12 and FOXA1. SPOP was 
the most frequently mutated gene, with mutations involving 
the SPOP substrate-binding cleft in 6–15% of tumors across 
multiple independent cohorts. Prostate cancers with mutant 
SPOP lacked ETS family gene rearrangements and showed a 
distinct pattern of genomic alterations. Thus, SPOP mutations 
may define a new molecular subtype of prostate cancer.
We performed exome capture followed by paired-end massively paral­
lel sequencing on genomic DNA from 112 prostate adenocarcinomas 
and matched normal samples. We focused on treatment-naïve radical 
prostatectomy specimens from US and Australian subjects that spanned 
a range of grades, stages and risks of recurrence (Online Methods and 
Supplementary Table 1). The baits for exon capture targeted 98.2% of 
genes in the Consensus CDS (CCDS) database. A mean coverage depth 
of 118× per sample was achieved, with 89.2% of targets covered at a depth 
of ≥20× (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2). DNA from 
tumors and normal samples was also analyzed by Affymetrix SNP 6.0 
arrays to detect somatic copy-number alterations. In addition, transcrip­
tome sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on 22 exome-sequenced 
tumors and 41 independent samples (Supplementary Fig. 2).
We identified 5,764 somatic mutations that were present in DNA from 
tumors but absent in DNA from peripheral blood or non-cancerous 
prostate tissue (Supplementary Table 3). Of these variants, 997 
occurred in a single tumor that harbored a frameshift mutation of the 
mismatch repair gene MSH6 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Excluding this 
highly mutated sample, the remaining tumors harbored a median of 
10 silent and 30 non-silent mutations (range 10 to 105 total mutations) 
or ~1.4 mutations per megabase of DNA covered (Supplementary 
Fig. 3). Analysis of 229 non-silent mutations by mass spectrometry 
genotyping validated 95.6% of variants with allelic fraction of ≥0.2 
(confidence interval (CI) = 92–98%) (Supplementary Table 3). The 
mutation rate of this cohort exceeded that of seven published pros­
tate tumor genomes (0.9 mutations per megabase)14, perhaps because 
increased exome sequence coverage improved the detection of vari­
ants present at lower allelic fractions.

We searched for genes that harbored more nonsynonymous 
mutations than expected by chance given gene size, sequence con­
text and the frequency of mutations for each tumor (Fig. 1a and 
Supplementary Table 4). Twelve genes were enriched for mutations 
at q value < 0.1, the majority of which are highly expressed at the 
transcript level in prostate tumors (Supplementary Fig. 4). The iden­
tification of PIK3CA, TP53 and PTEN confirmed that our approach 
detected alterations known to promote tumorigenesis in prostate can­
cer and other malignancies. We also found evidence of enrichment 
for mutations in the PTEN pathway, cell cycle regulatory machinery 
and other gene sets (Supplementary Table 5)12.
The most frequently mutated gene was SPOP (in 13% of tumors; 
Fig. 1), which encodes the substrate-binding subunit of a Cullin-based 
E3 ubiquitin ligase15,16. Although isolated SPOP mutations have been 
reported in prostate cancer14,17, this gene has not previously been found 
to be mutated at a significant frequency in any malignancy. Several
genes not previously known to undergo somatic alteration in 
prostate cancer were enriched for mutations, including FOXA1, 
MED12, THSD7B, SCN11A and ZNF595. 
The CDKN1B gene encoding p27Kip1 was 
somatically mutated in 3 samples and 
deleted in 16 others (Fig. 1b). p27Kip1 con­
strains prostate tumor growth in mice18 and 
CDKN1B harbors a germline prostate cancer 
risk allele19, but somatic substitutions had 
not previously been observed in this cell 
cycle regulator. Infrequent mutations were 
also detected in multiple proto-oncogenes, 
tumor suppressors and chromatin-modifying 
enzymes (Supplementary Table 4 and 
Supplementary Note).
The forkhead transcription factor gene 
FOXA1 harbored non-silent mutations in 
4 of 111 exomes and 4 of 41 independent 
RNA-seq samples. The FOXA1 protein is 
required for epithelial cell differentiation in 
the mouse prostate20 and promotes cell cycle 
progression in castration-resistant pros­
tate cancer21. Notably, FOXA1 modulates 
androgen receptor–driven transcription22 and activates expression 
of CDKN1B23. Mutations strictly affected residues in the forkhead 
domain (Supplementary Table 4) that resides near the DNA-binding 
surface (Fig. 2a)24. The clustered nature of these mutations suggests 
that they may disrupt binding of FOXA1 to DNA targets.
Mutations affecting MED12 were observed in 6 of 111 exomes, 
with a recurrent L1224F variant (encoded by c.3670C>T or 
c.3669_3670TC>GT) being identified in five samples (Fig. 2b and 
Supplementary Table 4). MED12 encodes a subunit of the mediator 
complex and the cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) subcomplex that 
regulates basal and stimulus-specific transcriptional programs25–27. 
Recently, MED12 mutations were reported in 70% of uterine leiomyo­
mas28, benign stromal tumors of the smooth muscle lineage. Mutations 
in prostate cancer affected distinct codons from those in leiomyoma 
and occurred in epithelial cells rather than stroma, as determined by 
laser-capture microdissection (LCM) (Supplementary Fig. 5). MED12 
mutations may conceivably perturb CDK8-dependent modulation of 
transcriptional programs linked to p53 and androgen signaling26,27.

Although SPOP mutations were originally reported in genomic 
studies of prostate cancer (Supplementary Table 6)14,17, their preva­
lence and functional relevance remained unknown. We therefore 
sequenced this gene in multiple additional cohorts comprising over 
300 primary tumors and metastases from individuals in the United 
States and Europe. Using RNA-seq and Sanger sequencing of tumor 
and matched germline DNA, recurrent heterozygous SPOP substitu­
tions were identified in 6–13% of primary prostate adenocarcino­
mas (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 7). 
No mutations were identified in 36 benign prostate tissue samples, 
5 samples of prostate stroma or 6 common prostate cell lines. SPOP 
mutations were also found in 6 of 41 individuals with metastatic 
disease (14.5%) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 7). Thus, SPOP 
mutations occurred at a frequency of 6–15% across localized and 
advanced prostate tumors.
All SPOP mutations affected conserved residues in the structurally 
defined substrate-binding cleft (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 7)16. 
Several recurrently altered residues have key roles in substrate inter­
action; moreover, alteration of Tyr87, Trp131 and Phe133 disrupted 
substrate binding in vitro16. These results strongly suggest that SPOP 
mutations in prostate cancer are biologically consequential. To test this 
hypothesis, we examined the consequences of mutant SPOP protein 
expression or SPOP knockdown on tumorigenic phenotypes in vitro. 
Prostate cancer cells transfected with the most common SPOP mutant 
(the F133V variant) or with SPOP siRNA showed increased invasion 
compared to controls (Fig. 3c–e and Supplementary Fig. 8), but cell 
growth and viability were largely unaltered (Supplementary Fig. 9). 
The SPOP-CUL3 complex affects a variety of substrates that par­
ticipate in multiple pathways, including hedgehog, c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase (JNK) and steroid receptor signaling cascades29–31. SPOP 
undergoes amplification in other malignancies and may be overex­
pressed in renal cell carcinoma29; however, multiple prostate cancer 
cohorts showed no evidence of SPOP amplification or upregulation 
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). Prostate cancer–
associated SPOP mutations may conceivably result in de novo gain-
of-function alterations (for example, interaction with a distinct sub­
strate profile), dominant-negative effects or more subtle alterations in 
substrate specificity. Further studies are necessary to determine the 
specific ubiquitin ligase functions and cellular pathways deregulated 
by SPOP mutation in prostate cancer.
Notably, all exomes with SPOP mutations lacked the TMPRSS2-
ERG fusion or other ETS family gene rearrangements present in up 
to 50% of prostate cancers (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 12)11,32. 
This mutually exclusive relationship between SPOP mutation and ERG 
rearrangement (P < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test) was confirmed in evalu­
able samples across all five cohorts tested (Supplementary Fig. 12), 
even within an individual prostate tumor (Supplementary Fig. 13). 
Thus, SPOP mutation and ETS family gene fusions may represent 
early and divergent driver events in prostate carcinogenesis. SPOP 
mutations were identified in LCM-analyzed high-grade intraepithelial 
neoplasia (HG-PIN) adjacent to invasive adenocarcinoma, providing 
further support for the idea that SPOP mutation comprises an early 
event in prostate tumorigenesis (Supplementary Fig. 14).
In light of previous studies suggesting that prostate cancer may be 
classified by co-occurring genomic alterations12,33,34, we investigated 
whether tumors with SPOP mutations were enriched for other genomic 
lesions (Fig. 4). Recurrent somatic deletions at 5q21 and 6q21 were 
found to be enriched in these tumors (P = 1.4 × 10−11 and 3.4 × 10−7, 
respectively, Fisher’s exact test), both in the cohort used for whole-
exome sequencing and in an independent prostate cancer collection 
(Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 8). Thus, loss of tumor suppressor 
genes in these regions may cooperate with SPOP mutation to promote 
tumorigenesis. The relevant 5q21 locus contains CHD1, which encodes 
a chromatin-modifying enzyme that also undergoes disruptive rear­
rangements in prostate cancer14. The 6q21 region encompasses sev­
eral genes, including FOXO3, a FOXA1 homolog that has previously 
been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis and progression35, and 
PRDM1, a tumor suppressor in lymphoma36. In contrast, TP53 lesions 
were generally absent in tumors with SPOP mutations (P = 0.015, 
Fisher’s exact test), despite the fact that this tumor suppressor was 
recurrently mutated and deleted (Fig. 1). SPOP mutations also trended 
inversely with point mutations and/or copy-number loss involving the 
PTEN locus in primary tumors (P = 0.044, Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. 4); 
this pattern was supported by FISH analysis for PTEN deletion

(Supplementary Fig. 15). Tumors with SPOP 
mutations also lacked PIK3CA mutations 
(Fig. 4). Although the inverse relationship between SPOP mutations 
and PTEN and PIK3CA alterations was observed in primary tumors 
(P = 0.041, Fisher’s exact test), these events co-occurred more fre­
quently in metastatic tumors (Supplementary Fig. 15). Further stud­
ies are needed to determine whether these genetic relationships also 
occur in other populations of affected individuals and to elucidate 
the biological interactions that may underlie this phenomenon. Taken 
together, these results suggest that SPOP mutations may anchor a dis­
tinct genetic subtype of ETS fusion–negative cancers.
In summary, whole-exome sequencing has identified genes that 
are recurrently mutated in prostate cancer. These efforts have also 
revealed a distinct ETS fusion–negative subclass of prostate cancer 
characterized by recurrent SPOP mutations and enriched for both 
5q21 and 6q21 deletions. In the future, this expanded genetic frame­
work may articulate new mechanisms of carcinogenesis that inform 
both disease modeling and patient stratification for clinical trials of 
experimental agents. Together with additional comprehensive analy­
ses of the prostate cancer genome, epigenome and transcriptome, 
these systematic approaches should illuminate the landscape of altera­
tions that underlie disease biology and therapeutic vulnerability in 
this common and clinically heterogeneous malignancy.

SPOP mutation in both discovery and validation 
cohorts are given below (Fisher’s exact test).

ONLINE METHODS
DNA extraction and exome sequencing. Slides for hematoylin and eosin stain­
ing were cut from all frozen tissue blocks and examined by a board-certified 
pathologist to select for high-density cancer foci with <10% stroma or other 
non-cancerous material to ensure high purity of cancer DNA. Biopsy cores were 
then taken from the corresponding frozen tissue block for DNA extraction. 
From each sample, 25–30 mg of tissue was homogenized. DNA was extracted 
from homogenate and quantified using Picogreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent 
(Invitrogen). Samples were separated on agarose gels (E-Gel, Invitrogen) to 
assess structural integrity. All DNA samples were stored at −20 °C. Ancestry 
analysis of sequenced samples is shown in Supplementary Figure 16.
Whole-exome capture libraries were constructed from 100 ng of DNA from 
tumors and normal tissue after sample shearing, end repair, phosphorylation 
and ligation to barcoded sequencing adaptors37. Ligated DNA was size selected 
for lengths between 200–350 bp and subjected to exonic hybrid capture using 
SureSelect v2 Exome bait (Agilent). Samples were multiplexed and sequenced on 
multiple Illumina HiSeq flow cells for average target exome coverage of 118×.
Copy-number analysis. DNA from tumors and normal tissue was analyzed by 
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays to detect regions of somatic copy-number alteration 
(Supplementary Table 9). Quality control, segmentation and copy-number 
analysis were performed as previously described33, with one additional step 
aimed at diminishing the number of recurrent lesions possibly caused by germ­
line signal: we applied the same detection pipeline to the DNA samples from 
normal tissue alone. All peaks detected in both analyses were excluded from the 
list of recurrent somatic copy-number aberrations. The remaining lesions with 
Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) q value of <0.1 
were included in analysis of copy-number alterations associated with mutated 
genes. Two-tailed Fisher’s exact tests were applied for all association tests.
Sequence data processing and quality control. Exome sequence data process­
ing and analysis were performed using pipelines at the Broad Institute14,38,39. 
A BAM file aligned to the hg19 human genome build was generated from 
Illumina sequencing reads for each tumor and normal sample by the Picard 
pipeline. The Firehose pipeline was used to manage input and output files and 
submit analyses for execution by GenePattern40.
Quality control modules in Firehose were used to compare genotypes 
derived from Affymetrix arrays and sequencing data to ensure concordance. 
Genotypes from SNP arrays were also used to monitor for low levels of cross-
contamination between samples from different individuals in sequencing data 
using the ContEst algorithm41.
Mutation calling and identification of significantly mutated genes. The 
MuTect algorithm from the Broad Institute Genome Analysis Toolkit was used 
to identify somatic single-nucleotide variants (SSNVs) in targeted exons39,42. 
MuTect identifies candidate SSNVs by Bayesian statistical analysis of bases and 
their qualities in the tumor and normal BAM files at a given genomic locus. We 
required a minimum of 14 reads covering a site in the tumor and 8 reads in the 
normal sample for mutation calling. We determined the lowest allelic fraction 
at which SSNVs could be detected on a per-sample basis, using estimates of 
cross-contamination from the ContEst pipeline41. Small somatic insertions 
and deletions (indels) were detected using the Indelocator algorithm after local 
realignment of sequences from tumors and normal samples42.
The MutSig algorithm from the Broad Institute was applied to identify genes 
or gene sets that were significantly enriched for mutations, given sequence 
context and genomic territory14,39,42. For each gene, we calculated the prob­
ability of detecting the observed constellation of mutations or a more extreme 
one, given the background mutation rates calculated across the data set. This 
P value was then adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing (Benjamini-Hochberg 
procedure) to obtain a q value. Mutations in significantly mutated genes and 
the others described were manually reviewed by examination of BAM files in 
the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)43.
Validation of selected mutations by mass spectrometry genotyping. We 
chose 240 non-silent mutations (231 SSNVs and 9 indels) across 48 pairs of 
tumor and normal samples to validate by mass spectrometry genotyping using 
the iPLEX platform (Sequenom). We targeted 74 mutations in significantly 
mutated genes or gene sets with q value of <0.1 and mutations reported in 
COSMIC. The remaining 166 non-silent mutations were chosen at random. 
Because the rate of validation using this technology is significantly lower when 
the mutant allele is present at low allelic fraction14,38, we attempted to validate 
only mutations with allelic fraction of ≥0.2 (where 20% of sequence reads from 
the tumor contained the mutation).
Of the 240 assays attempted, 228 gave successful genotype calls, and 218 
somatic mutations were confirmed (Supplementary Table 3). All events called 
in the tumor were absent from the corresponding normal sample. The overall 
accuracy for mutation calling was 95.6% (Clopper-Pearson 95% CI = 92–98%), 
in close agreement with previous studies14,38,39.
Mutation annotation. Somatic point mutations and indels were annotated 
using information from publicly available databases, including the UCSC 
Genome Browser’s UCSC Genes track44, miRBase release 15 (ref. 45), dbSNP 
build 132 (ref. 46), UCSC Genome Browser’s ORegAnno track47, UniProt 
release 2011_03 (ref. 48) and COSMIC v51 (ref. 49).
Mutations were classified as heterozygous or homozygous using the 
ABSOLUTE algorithm50. ABSOLUTE integrates genome-wide copy-number 
data from SNP arrays and the allelic fraction values of somatic mutations to 
model gene and mutation copy number in a tumor. Only a subset of tumors 
contained sufficient copy-number alterations to permit analysis. Mutations 
in these tumors were annotated as heterozygous or homozygous and clonal 
or subclonal. Mutation multiplicity, equal to the average number of copies of 
a mutation per cancer cell, was also calculated (Supplementary Figs. 17 and 
18 and Supplementary Table 10).
RNA extraction and RNA-seq sample prep, sequencing and processing. 
RNA was extracted from the frozen cancer tissue using TRIzol (Invitrogen), 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA was prepared in accord­
ance with Illumina’s sample preparation protocol for paired-end sequencing 
of mRNA, as previously described51. Paired-end reads were aligned to 
the human genome (hg18) using ELAND, as previously described51. Data 
were visualized using IGV43, and candidate mutations were identified in SPOP 
coding regions.
DNA extraction and SPOP genotyping. DNA was extracted using phenol-
chloroform and purified by an ethanol precipitation method, as previously 
described14. Direct Sanger sequencing of putative SPOP somatic mutations 
in all tumor-blood pairs was performed by standard methods, following PCR 
amplification using specific primers. The sequences of the primers used for 
amplifying and sequencing SPOP are given (Supplementary Table 11).
Laser capture microdissection. Tissue sections (5 µm thick) were cut, 
fixed and stained on membrane-coated slides and were dissected with the 
ArcturusXT LCM Instrument (Life Technologies). Tissue staining and LCM 
were performed as described52. A combination of inferred capture and UV 
laser cutting was carried out to best recover a precise subset of cells. DNA was 
amplified with the Whole Genome Amplification kit (WGA4), as suggested 
by the manufacturer for the single-cell approach (Sigma-Aldrich). Standard 
PCR was used for targeted enrichment of SPOP exons 6 and 7, and Sanger 
sequencing was performed.
FISH. ETS rearrangement status and PTEN deletion status were assessed 
on tissue slides from the same tumor nodule used for RNA and DNA extrac­
tion. FISH methods to detect TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions have been previously 
described9,11. We used ERG, ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5 break-apart FISH assays to 
confirm gene rearrangement on the DNA level53. To assess the status of PTEN, 
we used a locus-specific probe and a reference probe, as previously described14. 
The sequences of all FISH probes are listed (Supplementary Table 12).
Quantitative RT-PCR. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent, subjected to 
DNase treatment (DNA-free Kit; Applied Biosystems) according to the manu­
facturer’s instructions and used in quantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative RT-PCR 
was performed using the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), 
following the manufacturer’s RNA-to-CT 1-step protocol. Each target was run in 
triplicate, and expression levels relative to those of the housekeeping gene GAPDH

were determined on the basis of the comparative threshold cycle method (2−∆∆CT). 
The sequences for primers used in these experiments are given (Supplementary 
Table 9). All experiments were run in triplicate; results are representative of three 
independent experiments.
Immunohistochemistry. ERG rearrangement status was confirmed by 
immuno­histochemistry, as previously described54. Briefly, primary rabbit 
monoclonal antibody to ERG was obtained from Epitomics (2805-1). Antigen 
recovery was conducted using heat retrieval and CC1 standard, a high pH 
Tris/borate/EDTA buffer (VMSI, 950-124). Slides were incubated with a 1:100 
dilution of the primary antibody to ERG for 1 h at room temperature. Primary 
antibody was detected using the ChromoMap DAB detection kit (VMSI, 760-
159) and UltraMap horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary anti­
body to rabbit (VMSI, 760-4315). The secondary antibody was applied for 
16 min at room temperature. Slides were counterstained with Hematoxylin II 
(VMSI, 790-2208) for 8 min and with Bluing Reagent (VMSI, 760-2037) for 
4 min at 37 °C. Subjective evaluation of ERG protein expression was scored 
as positive or negative by pathologists for the study.
Plasmids expressing SPOP. Wild-type SPOP was obtained from Origene in 
a mammalian expression vector encoding C-terminal Myc and Flag tags. The 
sequence encoding SPOP F133V was created using the QuikChange II Site-
Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent). The sequences of all plasmids were con­
firmed by Sanger sequencing, and protein expression was confirmed by protein 
blot using antibodies to Myc (Upstate, 05-724), and Flag (Sigma, F3165).
Cell culture and transfection. The human prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1 
and DU145 and the benign prostate cell line RWPE were obtained from the 
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The 22Rv1 and DU145 cells 
were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS 
and penicillin/streptomycin. RWPE cells were maintained in Keratinocyte-
SFM (Invitrogen) supplemented with human recombinant epidermal growth 
factor (Invitrogen) and bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen), according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.
For siRNA transfection, RWPE (2.5 × 105 per well), 22Rv1 (4 × 105 per well) 
and DU145 (2 × 105 per well) cells were seeded on 6-well tissue culture plates. 
The next day, cells were transfected with 100 nM SPOP or non-targeting (con­
trol) siRNAs (ON-TARGETplus, Thermo Scientific) using Dharmfect 2 rea­
gent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For plasmid 
transfection, DU145 (4 × 105 per well) cells were seeded on 6-well tissue cul­
ture plates. The next day, cells were transfected with 4 ug of pCMV6 encoding 
wild-type SPOP or pCMV encoding SPOP F133V using Lipofectamine 2000 
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell viability and proliferation assays. The 22Rv1 (2 × 103 per well) and 
DU145 (1 × 103 per well) cells transfected with control or SPOP siRNA or with 
plasmids expressing SPOP were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates. Cell 
viability and growth was determined by performing WST-1 assays (Roche), 
reading absorbance at 450 nm according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Values from three wells were obtained for each treatment and time point. 
Results are representative of three independent experiments.
Invasion assays. For invasion assays, 7.5 × 104 22Rv1 and 5 × 104 DU145 cells 
transfected with control or SPOP siRNA or with plasmids expressing SPOP 
were resuspended in 0.5 ml of RPMI-1640 medium containing 1% FBS and 
placed into the top chamber of Matrigel-coated 8-µm Transwell inserts (BD 
Falcon). The bottom wells contained RPMI supplemented with 5–10% FBS. 
After 24 h (DU145) or 48 h (22Rv1), the filters were fixed and stained with 
0.5% crystal violet for 30 min, and cells on the upper surface of the filters were 
removed with a cotton swab. Migrated cells were quantified by counting the 
numbers of cells that penetrated the membrane in four microscopic fields 
(viewed at 20× magnification) per filter. All experiments were performed in 
triplicate; results are representative of three independent experiments.
