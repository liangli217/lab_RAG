Comment on “DNA damage is a
pervasive cause of sequencing
errors, directly confounding
variant identification”

Chen et al. (Reports, 17 February 2017, p. 752) highlight an important problem of
sequencing artifacts caused by DNA damage at the time of sample processing. However,
their manuscript contains several errors that led the authors to incorrect conclusions.
Moreover, the same sequencing artifacts were previously described and mitigated in The
Cancer Genome Atlas and other published sequencing projects.
T
he sequencing artifacts discussed in Chen
et al. (1) have been described in publica-
tions from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
and other cancer genome projects (2–4).
Accordingly, effective mitigation strategies
have long been implemented, including software
pipelines and improved library preparation meth-
ods, as described in Costello et al. (2). Thus, find-
ings described in TCGA publications (5–9) were
not affected by oxidative damage, as suggested by
Chen et al. The authors do raise general aware-
ness of sequencing artifacts, which include ma-
chine errors (2), DNA oxidation (2–4), and DNA
cross-linking (in clinically used formalin-fixed
tissues) (10) among others; however, their paper
contains several errors that led to incorrect con-
clusions. The errors affect the following:
i) Estimation of oxidative damage levels: Al-
though their reported oxidative damage (8-oxo-G)
metric, GIVG_T, is essentially equivalent to an ear-
lier reported metric, oxoQ (2–4, 11), their software
implementation is limited by using reads aligned
only to the forward strand and biased by filtering
out low-quality bases. OxoQ was designed to be
interpreted as a (Phred-like) base quality score.
As such, oxoQ can be compared to typical levels
of sequencing errors, which for most Illumina
sequencing protocols is roughly at the level of
Q ~ 30 (i.e., an error rate of 1 per 1000 bases). We
initially noticed a poor agreement between the
oxoQ and GIVG_T metrics for damaged samples
(oxoQ < 30; Fig. 1A), whereas scores were con-
sistent for samples with low levels of DNA dam-
age. Examining the methods of Chen et al., we
found that the authors’ code with default param-
eters applied a high base quality threshold (Q > 30)
and removed sites where total coverage exceeds

Fig. 1. Comparison of GIVG_T to oxoQ score. (A) Picard oxoQ score versus
GIVG_T for ~1900 TCGA tumor exomes. Lack of agreement between oxoQ and
GIVG_T scores is apparent in samples with high DNA damage (oxoQ < 30)
highlighted in the gray box. GIVG_T is calculated with Chen et al.’s code
(estimate_damage.pl) with default parameters; oxoQ was calculated with
Picard CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics (11) output. (B) OxoQ versus GIVG_T
corrected (using base quality Q > 20 and coverage depth ≥20×, comparable
to Picard defaults) showing excellent agreement. Color code in (A) and (B)
indicates data from seven different TCGA tumor types. (C) Histogram of
individual base qualities in a typical TCGA 8-oxo-G–damaged sample (oxoQ =
24.2) compared to a low-damage sample (oxoQ = 48.9). Most of the bases in
the damaged sample have Q < 30 and hence are ignored by default GIVG_T.
This explains both the lack of agreement between the scores seen in (A) and
the authors missing the sequence context associated with 8-oxo-G damage
[(D) versus (E)]; that is, the Q > 30 filtering removed bases with the type of
damage that is being quantified. (D and E) “Lego” plot showing the
distribution of errors in different 5′ and 3′ sequence contexts (plotted in
reverse complement by convention), with Chen et al.’s (D) and our corrected
(E) filtering criteria, showing distortion from the characteristic 8-oxo-G
context pattern arising from data selection criteria. (F) The fraction of bases

100×, which discarded the bulk of the data for the
most damaged samples (Fig. 1, C to F). Adjusting
the filtering criteria to include bases with Q > 20 and
to allow sites with depth above 100× restored con-
cordance between GIVG_T and oxoQ scores (Fig. 1B).
ii) Claim of no context specificity of 8-oxo-G
damage: The authors’ conclusion that they “did
not observe nucleotide context specificity” of
8-oxoG damage (1) is a consequence of their fil-
tering out most of the supporting data, as de-
scribed above. Sequence context specificity is a
key feature of 8-oxo-G damage (12), can affect
mutational signature analysis, and can be visu-
alized using “Lego” plots (Fig. 1, D and E). These
plots show the error rate of each type of base
substitution in its three-base sequence context
(2). The damaged bases reported by Chen et al.’s
script (Fig. 1D) have a severely distorted error
profile inconsistent with the previously reported
(12) 8-oxo-G damage pattern (Fig. 1E, C > A errors
in the Lego plot with a clear peak at the sequence
context CCG > CAG), whereas the corrected GIVG_T
script [and the previous implementation in (2)]
results in a distribution of errors (Fig. 1E) con-
sistent with 8-oxo-G damage. Thus, 8-oxo-G dam-
age does in fact have a sequence context, which
the authors apparently missed as a result of their
filtering strategy.
iii) Interpretation of 8-oxo-G damage levels:
The authors state that “73% of the TCGA se-
quencing runs showed extensive damage, with a
GIVG_T > 2.” A GIVG_T metric of 2 indicates that
the G > T error rate in the 8-oxo-G mode is twice
the error rate of the non–8-oxo-G mode (back-
ground rate for G > T errors). Even if the 8-oxo-G
artifacts are twice the context-specific background
level (i.e., GIVG_T = 2), this corresponds to only a
5 to 10% increase in the overall base-level error
rate (summed over all sequence contexts; Fig. 2,
A to C), which is less than the intersample varia-
bility of error rates at a fixed oxoQ. A 5% increase
in the base-level error rate results in a minor, if
any, increase in false-positive mutation calls
(Fig. 2, E and F), because calling algorithms are
designed to handle typical levels of sequencing
error. Only at GIVG_T ≳5 (equivalent to oxoQ ≲35)
do the additional errors from 8-oxo-G become
comparable to the sum of all other errors and
have an adverse impact on variant calling. The
vast majority of samples in TCGA exhibit only
minor 8-oxo-G damage that has minimal impact
on mutation calling. Consequently, the claim that
73% of TCGA sequencing runs have extensive
damage is misleading.
iv) Estimation of the false positive rate (FPR)
of mutation calling: The authors define an FPR
metric, which suggests that mutation calls for
many samples in public databases contain >50%
falsely detected somatic variants due to sequenc-
ing artifacts (Fig. 2D). However, their metric does
not reflect the actual somatic mutations used for
analyses in (3–10) and other TCGA publications
[e.g., a recent reanalysis of TCGA data (13)], but
instead represents candidate variants supported
by as few as two nonreference reads [not con-
sidered as somatic variants by most mutation
callers (14)]. Moreover, the mathematical defini-
tion of their FPR metric is neither a FPR nor a
false discovery rate (FDR), which is highlighted
by the fact that it can range between –1 and 1 (and
not between 0 and 1). Therefore, Chen et al. in-
correctly concluded that the FPR exceeds 0.5 in
samples that have a low level of DNA damage
with nearly no damage-induced false-positive mu-
tation calls (Fig. 2, D to G).
v) Finally, Chen et al. overlook publications
describing 8-oxo-G damage (2–10) that TCGA
and other projects have mitigated with labora-
tory protocols and software filtering strategies
when sequencing library regeneration was im-
practical (Fig. 2, F and G). Moreover, they claim
that “recent submissions to TCGA (November to
December 2015) displayed similar G-to-T imbal-
ances” but mistakenly interpreted the time that
the data repository was last updated as the time of
sequencing data generation (repository updates
occurred periodically for unrelated issues). The
actual dates of generating the sequencing data
should be obtained from the sequencing meta-
data. In fact, most TCGA samples sequenced after

October 2012 had low 8-oxo-G damage due to
improved library preparation [as described in (2)].
In conclusion, we disagree with the assessment
of Chen et al. regarding the quality of published
cancer genome projects. Raw sequencing data
inherently contain errors; therefore, to avoid
misinterpreting the data, it is important that re-
searchers use established procedures and carefully
curated datasets in downstream analyses.
