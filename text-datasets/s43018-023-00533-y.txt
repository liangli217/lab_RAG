Analysis of premalignant tissue has identified the typical order of somatic 
events leading to invasive tumors in several cancer types. For other cancers, 
premalignant tissue is unobtainable, leaving genetic progression unknown. 
Here, we demonstrate how to infer progression from exome sequencing of 
primary tumors. Our computational method, PhylogicNDT, recapitulated 
the previous experimentally determined genetic progression of human 
papillomavirus-negative (HPV–) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC). We then evaluated HPV+ HNSCC, which lacks premalignant tissue, 
and uncovered its previously unknown progression, identifying early 
drivers. We converted relative timing estimates of driver mutations and 
HPV integration to years before diagnosis based on a clock-like mutational 
signature. We associated the timing of transitions to aneuploidy with 
increased intratumor genetic heterogeneity and shorter overall survival. 
Our approach can establish previously unknown early genetic progression 
of cancers with unobtainable premalignant tissue, supporting development 
of experimental models and methods for early detection, interception  
and prognostication.
Deciphering the temporal order of genetic lesions throughout the 
steps of cancer progression has long been a goal of cancer research1,2. 
That order can provide clues to etiology and cell-intrinsic mechanisms 
in tumorigenesis, informing studies of how normal tissue becomes 
a tumor, and can also provide ways to detect and treat early disease 
stages and identify early clonal events as promising targets for therapy 
of later invasive tumors3.
For cancers with well-defined pathologic progression from normal 
tissue, for example, adenoma through carcinoma in situ to invasive 
carcinoma, analysis of lesions along that trajectory has provided cor-
responding genetic progression models4–13. However, there are many 
cancer types with poorly defined, undetectable or difficult-to-biopsy 
premalignant lesions14–22 whose genetic progression thus remains 
speculative.
Here, we demonstrate how to infer the typical order of genetic 
events in a cancer type from exome sequencing of primary tumor 
samples taken long after cancer initiation. The genome of an inva-
sive tumor includes information about its initial genetic progression,

pattern of somatic mutations (colored bands) was consistent with 
some mutations (green) before the duplication and others (purple) 
thereafter. The driver mutation in TP53 (red) leading to a R248Q protein 
alteration was seen in both final copies of arm 17p, consistent with the 
mutation preceding the duplication.
Relative timing of all genetic events within each tumor is estimated 
across the genome by applying these principles in a probabilistic com-
putational framework25,26. Examples of inferred orders of events in two 
HPV– tumors are shown in Fig. 1c,d. The inferred timing of each event 
is represented as a posterior distribution over a molecular mutational 
time scale π, with π = 0 and π = 1 reflecting the times of the first and last 
clonal events, respectively26.
Next, PhylogicNDT combines the within-tumor timing (π value dis-
tributions) of selected driver events across a cohort of tumors to obtain 
a posterior distribution for the typical relative timings of the events. 
The median relative timing (mRT) for each genetic event provides a 
point estimate for ordering events into a genetic progression model.
We applied PhylogicNDT to WES data of 531 HNSCC tumor–normal 
pairs, with 421 HPV– and 101 HPV+ tumors. We focused on 64 established 
or candidate HNSCC drivers, including 24 frequently mutated genes 
and 40 frequently gained or lost genomic regions in either or both 
HPV– and HPV+ tumors (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
Corroborating timing of driver events in HPV– HNSCC
The genomic landscape of 421 HPV– tumors is illustrated in Fig. 1e. For 
each participant’s tumor, we report the number of mutations, relative 
activity of different mutational signatures, measures of genetic het-
erogeneity, smoking history and the occurrence of the most frequent 
10 driver genes and 15 copy number alterations, with tumor-specific 
timing estimates.
We computationally inferred the order of events among these 
HPV– HNSCCs and compared the order to the empirically derived 
progression model of Califano et al.8 (Fig. 1a). In that model, pre-
neoplastic tissue arises by loss of chromosome arm 9p (−9p; where 
CDKN2A resides), progressing to dysplasia with −17p (which includes 
TP53) and −3p. The transition to carcinoma in situ is associated with 
−13q, −11q and −14q, and, finally, progression to invasive cancer 
is associated with −6p, −8 and −4q. Even the partial orderings of 
within-tumor timing estimates were generally consistent with the 
Califano model (Fig. 1b–e). We combined the participant-specific 
orders of events across the cohort (using the PhylogicNDT 
LeagueModel tool; Methods) to obtain the typical order of the 
43 most prevalent driver events (Fig. 1f).
Computational timing analysis, based solely on primary tumor 
specimens, recapitulated and substantially expanded the empirical 
progression model of Califano et al. (Fig. 1a). Notably, losses described 
by Califano et al. appeared in our model in the same order as in their 
model. We predicted that timings of losses of the p and q arms of chro-
mosome 8 are different (P = 6.2 × 10−5). Indeed, the early loss of arm 8p, 
not evaluated by Califano et at., agreed with its frequent loss in early 
oral cavity dysplasia31.
The first and most prevalent event was –9p (prevalence of 84.6%; 
mRT = 0.05), the location of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor that is 
also inactivated by frequent (23.5%) and early (mRT = 0.27) point 
mutations or homozygous deletions (25.4% prevalence; mRT = 0.48). 
Nearly all HPV– HNSCC (388/421; 92.2%) had at least one such disruption 
of CDKN2A.
Disruption of TP53 was also frequent and early via mutation 
(78.4%; mRT = 0.14) or −17p (54.4%; mRT = 0.18), with at least one such 
event in 369 HPV– tumors (87.6%). Our timing of TP53 and CDKN2A 
single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) agreed with the long-appreciated 
presence of TP53 (ref. 30) and CDKN2A (ref. 32) mutations in dysplastic 
tissue of the head and neck. The third of the earliest genetic events 
identified by Califano et al., −3p, occurred in 339 tumors (80.5%); its 
mRT of 0.12 was similar to that of TP53 disruptions.
which is recorded in patterns of somatic mutations and copy number 
changes as cells evolve into an invasive clone23,24. We recently developed 
PhylogicNDT, an integrated suite of tools, to reconstruct the clonal 
architecture and relative timings of genetic events using a coherent 
probabilistic framework25,26 and have successfully applied it in several 
contexts25,27–29.
We asked whether more readily available whole-exome sequenc-
ing (WES) of primary tumors could similarly provide information on 
genetic progression.
We examined head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), 
which provides a unique opportunity to validate and extend such pro-
gression models. A quarter of a century ago, Califano et al.8 determined 
the genetic progression of classic HNSCC, typically associated with 
tobacco and alcohol use, from loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) analysis 
along the pathologic progression from normal tissue to initial lesion, 
dysplasia and carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma (Fig. 1a). That 
model, as confirmed and extended to other genetic events in subse-
quent studies30–34, continues to provide the framework for HNSCC 
progression35,36. A valid computational reconstruction of genetic pro-
gression from WES of primary HNSCC should agree with those findings 
and provide timing for additional genetic events.
In contrast to classic HNSCC, the genetic progression of the 
increasingly prevalent and clinically important HNSCC associated 
with human papillomavirus (HPV;37,38 abbreviated HPV+ HNSCC) has 
remained unknown39. Premalignant lesions have not been identified 
reliably for HPV+ HNSCC39,40. The early genetic events in classic HPV– 
HNSCC that disrupt the CDKN2A and TP53 loci are infrequent in HPV+ 
HNSCC, as the E7 and E6 viral protein products provide corresponding 
tumorigenic functions41,42. Whether HPV+ HNSCCs converge thereafter 
to the same genetic progression as HPV– HNSCC is unclear. Compu-
tational reconstruction provides a unique opportunity to determine 
the genetic progression of HPV+ HNSCC and explore whether the 
well-known differences between HPV+ and HPV– HNSCC in response 
to therapy35 are associated with their different genetic paths to inva-
sive cancer.
We thus applied PhylogicNDT to WES data from primary HNSCC 
to (1) demonstrate the reconstruction of genetic progression in HPV– 
HNSCC and (2) identify the genetic progression of HPV+ HNSCC. We 
started with HNSCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project43 
and collected samples from 43 additional oropharyngeal HNSCCs to 
increase the representation of HPV+ cases (101 total HPV+ HNSCCs).
Here, we report the validation of our computational approach in 
HPV– HNSCC, extending the number and details of timed events, and 
describe the previously unknown order of genetic progression of HPV+ 
HNSCC. We document the timing of different types of aneuploidy and 
their strong association with intratumor heterogeneity and survival. 
Additionally, we converted the relative timing estimates of main driv-
ers and HPV integration to years before diagnosis based on a clock-like 
mutational signature.
This report provides a framework for studying genetic progres-
sion of cancer types for which premalignant tissue is unobtainable. 
This framework enables uncovering mechanisms of cancer initiation 
and early development in types of cancer for which the rarity, inacces-
sibility, or lack of premalignant tissue previously made their genetic 
progressions undecipherable.
Results
The data in Fig. 1b show how the order of genetic events during tumor 
development is inferred from a tumor sample obtained long after ini-
tiation, once the fraction of cancer cells that harbor each mutation 
(cancer cell fractions (CCFs)) and their multiplicities (the number of 
DNA molecules carrying a mutation per cancer cell) are determined. 
In this example, cancer cells in the final tumor sample (Fig. 1b, right) 
showed four copies of chromosome arm 17q but only two copies of 
arm 17p, consistent with LOH at 17p followed by duplication. The final

We further identified prevalent and early −9q (51.5%; mRT = 0.17) 
and −8p (62.9%; mRT = 0.27) events. By contrast, the frequent +3q event 
(55.6%), containing the PIK3CA locus, was later (mRT = 0.51), suggesting 
a role in progression rather than initiation. Other arm-level gains and 
losses covered a wide range of relative timings.
Based on the Califano et al. model, we mapped relative timings to 
pathologic progressions. Precursor lesions become dysplastic near an 
mRT of ~0.25, between timings of −17p (0.18) and −13q (0.33). The transi-
tion to carcinoma in situ is near 0.7 (mRT of −14q and −4q) and that to 
invasive carcinoma at or after ~0.75 (−6p mRT = 0.73; −8q mRT = 0.8). 
Our timing of +3q (mRT = 0.51) and +8q (mRT = 0.57) before this esti-
mate of the transition to carcinoma in situ agrees with findings (pub-
lished after the Califano model) of these gains in dysplastic tissue33,34.
We further established relative timing of SNVs in several 
lower-prevalence driver genes (in order of increasing mRT): FBXW7, 
NOTCH1, CASP8, FAT1, NSD1, HRAS, EP300, CREBBP, KMT2D, PIK3CA, 
NFE2L2, HLA-A, SPEN and KMT2C. mRT values of events in the first nine 
genes were less than 0.69, supporting early roles in tumorigenesis 
before carcinoma in situ. Although individually of low prevalence (each 
<25%), a mutation in at least one of these first nine genes occurred in 
over 60% of HPV– HNSCCs (260/421). Mutations in PIK3CA, NFE2L2, 
HLA-A, SPEN and KMT2C were at later mRT values, presumably late in 
pathologic progression.
Finally, whole-genome events, leading to whole-genome 
copy number profiles that are predominantly triploid (WGT) or 
whole-genome doubling of both alleles (WGD) resulting in tetra-
ploid samples, occurred in nearly half (47.7%) of HPV– HNSCCs. 
These whole-genome events were late in progression (mRT values of 
0.78 (WGT) and 0.80 (WGD); Fig. 1f).
Establishing the genetic progression of HPV+ HNSCC
Encouraged by our success with classic HPV– HNSCC, we turned to HPV+ 
HNSCC, where pathologic progression has not been identified35,44. 
These tumors typically arise in crypts of tonsils and related lymphoid 
tissues at breaks of the basement membrane35,45,46 that allow viral access 
to infect basal epithelial cells and ready entry of transformed cells into 
the lymphatics (Fig. 2a). HPV+ HNSCC often spreads to local lymph 
nodes before a primary tumor is identified; premalignant tissue has 
seldom been found35,47.
We assembled WES data from 101 HPV+ HNSCCs, including 65 from 
TCGA43 and 36 collected for this study. Examples of within-tumor tim-
ing are shown in Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 1; the genetic landscape 
of HPV+ HNSCCs is illustrated in Fig. 2c. We found four mutational 
signatures in this cohort, with 28% of mutations attributed to aging 
signatures (single-base substitution 1 (SBS1) and SBS5) and 62% to 
APOBEC signatures (SBS2 and SBS13). Median tumor purity was 0.48 
(range of 0.12 to 0.98), and median ploidy was 2.14 (range of 1.60 to 
5.56; Methods).
As for HPV– HNSCC, we estimated the order of events (π) for each 
HPV+ tumor via PhylogicNDT SinglePatientTiming (Fig. 2c). We then 
combined timing information for 40 genetic driver events across 
tumors to infer the typical order in HPV+ cancers (Fig. 2d).
Gain of chromosome arm 3q and loss of 11q were both highly preva-
lent and early (+3q: 70.3% prevalence and mRT = 0.05; −11q: 69.3% 
prevalence and mRT = 0.20). Arm-level events −13q and +8q were also 
both highly prevalent (>40%) and early (mRT values of 0.21 and 0.24, 
respectively), suggesting frequent roles in early HPV+ progression. All 
other arm-level events had a prevalence of <40%.
Of 13 low-prevalence potential driver genes, mutations only in 
TRAF3, ZNF750 and NOTCH1 had mRT values of 0.55 or earlier, while oth-
ers had mRT values of 0.75 or greater. Except for PIK3CA (mRT = 0.83), 
none of the 13 potential driver genes were mutated in more than 15% of 
HPV+ tumors, although nearly three-quarters of tumors (74/101, 73%) 
had a mutation in at least 1 potential driver gene. Only 10 of 101 HPV+ 
HNSCCs had genome-wide events leading to WGT or WGD.
Comparing HPV+ and HPV– genetic progressions
In HPV+ HNSCC, the HPV E7 and E6 viral gene products inactivate the 
functions of CDKN2A and TP53, whereas in HPV– HNSCC, those func-
tions are lost via somatic events41,42. We sought to determine other 
similarities and differences in the progression of these two major 
HNSCC subtypes.
First, we compared the frequencies of genomic events in HPV+ 
and HPV– HNSCC. Even beyond expected differences associated with 
CDKN2A and TP53, 20 genetic events were significantly more prevalent 
in HPV– HNSCC, including SNVs in FAT1, NOTCH1, CASP8, HRAS, the −3p 
highly prevalent in HPV– HNSCC and 15 other arm-level somatic copy 
number alterations (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; Fisher’s exact test 
with Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate q value of <0.1). Notably, 
whole-genome events leading to WGT or WGD were nearly five times 
more prevalent in HPV– (201/421, 48%) than in HPV+ tumors (10/101, 
10%; P = 10−13, Fisher’s exact test). However, 14 events were found at 
higher prevalence in HPV+ than in HPV– HNSCC (SNVs in PIK3CA, ZNF750, 
EP300, CYLD, TRAF3, FGFR3, PTEN, B2M and RB1 and arm-level events 
+3q, −11q, −16q, −18q and +19q).
Comparing mutational signatures showed that the prevalence of 
all signatures differed between HPV+ and HPV– tumors, with APOBEC 
(SBS2/SBS13) and aging signatures (SBS1/SBS5) enriched in HPV+ 
tumors and the smoking signature (SBS4) enriched in HPV– tumors.
Next, to compare the timing of events, we examined 42 events 
present in at least three cases in each of the HPV+ and HPV– cohorts 
(Fig. 2e). We combined all anatomic sites, as the few (33) HPV– oro-
pharyngeal tumors did not allow reliable anatomic site-specific timing 
comparisons. We calculated distributions of differences in relative 
timing and assessed statistical significance by permutation (Methods). 
We detected 6 differentially timed events at q < 0.1 (5 earlier in HPV+ and 
1 in HPV–) and 12 more at q < 0.2.
Early high-prevalence genetic events in HPV– progression, −9p, 
−17p and mutation of TP53 (CDKN2A or TP53 inactivation), were 
earlier than in HPV+ tumors, as expected from the different mecha-
nisms for inactivating the function of these tumor suppressor genes. 
Lower-prevalence mutations in CREBBP, NOTCH1, FBXW7, FAT1 and 
NFE2L2 were also earlier in HPV– tumors.
The early and high-prevalence genetic events in HPV+ progres-
sion, +3q and −11q, were significantly earlier in HPV+ than in HPV– pro-
gression, supporting their roles as early HPV+ driver events. WGD in 
HPV+ HNSCC was also found to occur significantly earlier than in HPV– 
tumors, despite the much lower prevalence of WGD in HPV+ tumors. 
Other arm-level events earlier in HPV+ progression were gains +1q, +17q, 
+6p, +20p, +20q and +8q and loss of 6q.

Progressions in HNSCC subclasses and at anatomic subsites
Among HPV– HNSCC, prevalence of some genetic events differed mark-
edly among the major anatomic subdivisions oral cavity, oropharynx 
and larynx. NSD1 mutations were preferentially laryngeal, while 
almost all CASP8 mutations were in oral cavity tumors (Supplementary

mutations, reflecting distinct anatomic sites, have different genetic 
progression trajectories. We used PhylogicNDT to infer genetic progres-
sion of HPV– HNSCC subsets with mutations in NSD1 (n = 54) or CASP8 
(n = 50), comparing their timings against other HPV– tumors (Fig. 3). 
We also estimated timing in NOTCH1-mutated tumors (n = 54), which 
showed no significant subsite preference (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c).
The preferentially laryngeal NSD1-mutated tumors (Fig. 3a–c) 
had several events whose timing differed from other HPV– HNSCCs, 
despite typically similar event prevalence between those two groups 
(Supplementary Table 4). Mutations in KMT2D, CREBBP, EP300 and 
PIK3CA timed at an mRT of ≤0.11 in NSD1-mutated cases versus at an 
mRT of ≥0.63 in other HPV– HNSCCs. Homozygous deletions of CDKN2A 
were also significantly earlier in NSD1-mutated tumors. NSD1 muta-
tions themselves had an mRT of 0.42. Significantly later events were 
arm-level losses or gains. Some timing differences could be associated 
with increased smoking signature (SBS4) activity in NSD1-mutated 
tumors (Fig. 1b).
By contrast, CASP8-mutated tumors, almost solely in the oral 
cavity, showed major differences in event prevalence from other 
HPV– HNSCCs (Supplementary Table 5), while mRT values of most 
events were similar (Fig. 3e–f). Compared to other HPV– HNSCCs, 
they had a substantially lower prevalence of whole-genome events 
(14% versus 52.3%; P = 10−7, Fisher’s exact test). Nearly two-thirds of 
driver events (46 of 65) had differential prevalence (q < 0.1; Supple-
mentary Table 4). Events more frequent in CASP8-mutated tumors 
included +9p (64% versus 39.1%) and mutations in HRAS (36% ver-
sus 2.7%), FAT1 (52% versus 20.8%), EPHA2 (18% versus 2.4%), EP300 
(18% versus 4.6%) and NOTCH1 (38% versus16.2%). TP53 (50% ver-
sus 82.2%) and NSD1 (4% versus 14%) mutations and losses −17p 
(18% versus 59.3%), −3p (30% versus 87.3%) and −11q (8% versus 46.4%) 
were significantly less prevalent. CASP8-mutated tumors thus are 
evidently driven more by mutations in multiple driver genes than by 
chromosome arm gains or losses. Single-individual timing diagrams 
of CASP8-mutated cases show early CASP8, TP53 and CDKN2A muta-
tions (Fig. 3d). CASP8 mutation itself had an mRT of 0.34 (Fig. 3e), 
similar to that of NSD1 in the NSD1-mutated subset. Four events were 
significantly earlier in CASP8-mutated HPV– HNSCC than in other 
HPV– HNSCC (Fig. 3f), although of these, only +5p had a prevalence 
higher than 20%. Two losses, −9p and −15q, were significantly later in 
CASP8-mutated tumors.
NOTCH1-mutated tumors showed only few differences from other 
HPV– HNSCCs in event prevalence or timing, including a higher preva-
lence of mutations in CASP8 (24.1% versus 9.1%) and lower prevalence of 
+17p (19.0% versus 31.0%) and +8p (3.8% versus 17.3%; Supplementary 
Table 6). Only −5q showed different timing from other HPV– HNSCCs 
(mRT of 0.15 versus 0.45; Extended Data Fig. 2), although fewer events 
and individuals in this subtype might have limited the power of this 
analysis (Extended Data Fig. 2d).
Overall, timing analysis of distinct tumor subtypes can detect 
differential ordering of events independent of prevalence and associ-
ated subtype-specific orders with the unique biology of each subtype 
(Extended Data Fig. 3).
Genetic heterogeneity, aneuploidy and progression
High levels of genetic heterogeneity in a tumor are associated with worse 
outcomes in HNSCC48–51 and other types of cancer52. In HNSCC, studies 
have used the mutant allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) score as a 
measure of genetic heterogeneity, defined as the median-normalized 
width of the distribution of mutant allele fractions (MAFs; Fig. 4a–c and 
Extended Data Fig. 4)48. Heterogeneity of MAF values could arise from 
mutation multiplicity differences within cells or differences in muta-
tions among subclones. PhylogicNDT analysis allowed us to investigate 
relationships between MATH and other measures of genetic heteroge-
neity, evaluate the genomic source of high MATH scores and estimate 
how the MATH score changes during progression.
We identified three classes of tumor aneuploidy based on absolute 
copy number profiles (Fig. 4). About half of tumors (Fig. 4a) showed 
essentially diploid profiles, with some LOH or copy number gains. 
Tumors with more disrupted copy number profiles, suggesting a 
genome-wide amplification during tumorigenesis, unexpectedly 
manifested as two distinct subtypes with similar prevalence: (1) trip-
loid cancers with multiple genomic regions showing three total copies 
(WGT; Fig. 4b) and (2) tetraploid cancers with multiple genomic regions 
at four copies (two copies of each allele; Fig. 4c), suggesting a WGD 
event. Examples of single-tumor timing of these aneuploidy classes 
are in Extended Data Fig. 1.
We investigated timing differences between WGT and WGD events. 
WGT occurred significantly earlier in both WES and whole-genome 
sequencing (WGS) single-tumor data (rank-sum test, P < 0.001; 
Fig. 4d–f), suggesting that primary tumors with WGT profiles experi-
enced early WGD events, providing sufficient time to delete genomic 
regions that brings the average copy number down to approximately 
three. More recent genome duplication in tetraploid tumors (labeled 
WGD) kept the average copy number close to four. Increased ane-
uploidy going from diploid to WGD and WGT stages (Fig. 4a–c and 
Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5) and wider distributions of MAFs (higher 
MATH scores) with higher aneuploidy support this interpretation. 
Higher aneuploidy classes were associated with higher MATH values 
(Fig. 5a) and were thus related to that clinically relevant measure48–50. 
The fraction of the genome altered (FGA), reflecting the genomic 
regions with copy numbers different from the modal copy number 
level, provided an overall measure of aneuploidy. Noticeably, this 
measure was near linearly related to the MATH score (Fig. 5b) and 
strongly associated with aneuploidy class. The distribution of ane-
uploidy classes, FGA and MATH scores differed significantly between 
HPV+ and HPV– HNSCCs (Fig. 5b,c). The long-established relationship 
between HPV+ tumors and low MATH values48 is thus explained by lower 
prevalence of whole-genome events in HPV+ tumors.
As PhylogicNDT provided timing information for whole-genome 
events in single tumors, we could estimate MATH values before 
such events by only including mutations timed before a tumor’s 
whole-genome event (Fig. 5d). MATH values were generally much 
higher after WGD, presumably due to marked aneuploidy after 
doubling. Although high MATH is found in many diploid tumors 
(Fig. 5b,c), it is almost universal (213/233, 91.4%) in tumors with a whole- 
genome event.
Paired samples (two from the same tumor) were available for 
28 oropharyngeal tumors newly collected for this study. Although 
the mutations and subclonal composition could differ substantially 
between paired samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a), their overall MATH 
and FGA measures of heterogeneity were similar (Extended Data 
Fig. 6b). These measures seem to be intrinsic characteristics of a tumor 
as a whole, supporting their clinical potential as biomarkers.
Time between somatic events, including HPV integration, and 
diagnosis
We converted relative timing estimates to the expected number of 
years before diagnosis. We modeled CpG>T (‘aging’ signature SBS1) 
mutations (total number of mutations/number of covered CpG sites) 
as a function of participant age at diagnosis (Extended Data Fig. 5a). 
We observed an accumulation of 0.37 (interquartile range (IQR) of 
0.29–0.51) CpG>T mutations per megabase at risk per year in HNSCC 
HPV– tumors and a similar value of 0.39 (IQR of 0.25–0.45) in HPV+ 
tumors. We found that these rates were also similar among tumor 
anatomical sites (Extended Data Fig. 5a). We then used these rates to 
convert participant-specific CpG>T π estimates for driver events to real 
time, measured in years before diagnosis (Extended Data Fig. 5a–d).
Real-time timing estimates of WGT and WGD support a model with 
an abrupt transition from the WGD state to WGT (Fig. 4g, Extended 
Data Fig. 5c–e and Supplementary Table 7). Only two triploid tumors

had the WGD event estimated to occur during the 15-year period before 
diagnosis, whereas seven WGD cases did not transition to WGT in 
that time frame (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.033 compared to WGT/WGD 
greater than 15 years before diagnosis).
A Poisson-like process model with a fixed rate of conversion from 
WGD to WGT per year (allowing for a fraction of WGD cases to never 
transform to WGT) fits the data well (Fig. 4g, red and green curves) and 
yields a relatively narrow estimate for the conversion rate of 11 ± 2% 
per year (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 5c–e). About 35% of tumors 
never reached triploidy even if the WGD event happened decades 
before diagnosis.
The relationship between FGA and the timing of the WGD/
WGT event (Extended Data Fig. 5d) further supported an abrupt 
WGD-to-WGT transition. In a gradual process, cases with earlier WGD 
would slowly increase FGA over time. We instead found only a minor 
correlation in the years closest to diagnosis.

For other major somatic events, the earliest events in HPV– cancers 
(+3q, +8q and TP53) occur around 30–40 years before diagnosis, while 
HPV+ early events (+3q and +9q) occur around 20–30 years before 
diagnosis (Fig. 4h). More recent clonal events, occurring less than 15–20 
years before diagnosis, can be associated with clonal expansion, lead-
ing to primary disease. Although WGD events can occur very early, most 
occur ~20–25 years before diagnosis. All WGT tumors had the event 10 
or more years before diagnosis. These time scales are consistent with 
the slow conversion rates from dysplasia to invasive carcinoma, on the 
order of 1 to 4% per year, reported for HPV– HNSCC53.
Additionally, we estimated the timing of HPV integration events. 
We first aligned reads to the structural variation breakpoints at 
boundaries of 53 HPV integration sites across 11 individuals with 
WGS data (HPV can integrate multiple times per individual39) and 
analyzed multiplicities and CCFs (Extended Data Fig. 5f); 40 sites 
in 9 individuals showed good coverage. Many integration sites had 
high multiplicity on early gains, suggesting that integration of HPV 
is a pregain event contributing to initiating tumorigenesis. We also 
identified some lower-multiplicity and subclonal integration sites, 
suggesting that HPV integration is a continuous process that does 
not stop during progression (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 5f). 
Converting the timing of HPV+ integration into years before diagnosis 
suggests that initial HPV integration events can happen more than 
25 years before diagnosis, with additional integrations throughout 
tumor development (Fig. 4h).
In summary, our timing analysis shows that (1) tumors are typi-
cally diagnosed many years after key driver events, which can happen 
at different ages (Extended Data Fig. 5), (2) founding events can occur 
25–35 years or more before diagnosis, (3) WGT events do not seem to 
occur in the last ~10 years before diagnosis, and (4) HPV integration 
sites occur early in tumor development so that HPV, as expected, is 
the main contributor to HPV+ cancer initiation.

Associations of heterogeneity and aneuploidy with outcome
Associations of HPV– status and high MATH score with shorter overall 
survival in HNSCC are well established49–52. To see whether FGA and 
whole-genome events are similarly associated with outcome, we first 
examined a large subset of individuals whose survival is most strongly 
associated with intratumor heterogeneity: those without high-risk 
pathologic features who received either chemoradiation therapy or 
surgery without adjuvant therapy51. Initial analysis was restricted to 
individuals with HPV– tumors to remove confounding associations. 
Among these 145 individuals (with 53 deaths), high FGA showed an asso-
ciation with overall survival similar to that of high MATH. High- versus 
low-score hazard ratios (HRs; with 95% confidence interval (CI95%)) were 
FGA (2.09; 1.05–4.2) and MATH (2.08; 1.11–3.9). Aneuploid tumors or 
tumors with whole-genome events leading to WGD or WGT had weaker 
associations with overall survival (aneuploid/diploid HR of 1.73 and 
CI95% of 0.99–3.0; whole-genome event/none HR of 1.54 and CI95% of 
0.89–2.7; Fig. 5e–g).
To evaluate these associations in more individuals, including 
those with HPV+ tumors, while taking other outcome-associated 
variables into account, we extended our published survival model 
with MATH51 to incorporate the additional cases in this study. MATH 
was significantly associated overall with outcome (chi-square 17.75, 
4 d.f., P = 0.0014, Wald test). Replacing MATH with FGA or WGD/WGT 
(Fig. 5e–g) in an otherwise identical model also showed significant 
associations with outcome (FGA: chi-square 12.68, 4 d.f., P = 0.013; 
WGD/WGT: chi-square 10.32, 4 d.f., P = 0.035). Aneuploidy class ana-
lyzed similarly was just above the significance threshold (chi-square 
8.97, P = 0.06). Applying the Akaike information criterion (AIC), MATH 
(AIC of 1,350) had the strongest association with survival, although 
genomic instability measures had similar AIC scores (FGA, 1,355; WGD/
WGT, 1,358; aneuploidy, 1,360).
Early genetic progression and aneuploidy development in tumors 
thus can be modeled computationally using WES data from primary 
tumors, providing findings about processes strongly associated with 
survival. Timing analysis is possible even when premalignant tissue is 
unobtainable, as in HPV+ HNSCC.
Discussion
Our analysis of HPV+ HNSCC fills a major gap in knowledge about the 
progression of genetic events in this increasingly prevalent and clini-
cally significant disease35,37, a cancer whose lack of premalignant tissue 
frustrated prior attempts at timing39,40. Analysis of HPV– HNSCC verified 
that our computational approach could recapitulate the progression in 
classic HPV– disease8,54 and extend the progression model to additional 
events in significant subsets of HPV– disease. These results on cohorts of 
primary HNSCC specimens suggest that this approach could be applied 
to other types of cancer whose early genetic progression is unknown 
because premalignant tissue is difficult or impossible to obtain.
We extended the genetic progression model for HPV– HNSCC to 
a total of 61 SNV or copy number alteration events, of which 17 had 
>40% prevalence. Our timing estimates agreed well with the Califano 
et al. model8 and with more recent studies that refined and extended 
it30–34. Comparing predicted mRT values (Fig. 1e) for events associ-
ated with the progression stages reported by Califano et al.8 (Fig. 1a) 
allowed us to map pathologic disease stages onto the mRT timeline. 
We determined when whole-genome events leading to WGD or WGT 
occur during HPV– tumorigenesis, yielding estimates before or near 
the clinical development of invasive cancer.
Additionally, we identified genes with early mutations that likely 
play roles in HPV– tumor initiation (FBXW7, NOTCH1, CASP8, FAT1, NSD1, 
HRAS, EP300, CREBBP and KMT2D), with over 60% of HPV– HNSCCs 
having a mutation in at least one of these genes. Of those, we found 
anatomic and genetic differences among tumors, with CASP8 muta-
tions almost solely in the oral cavity and NSD1 predominant in laryngeal 
tumors. By contrast, tumors with NOTCH1 mutations, long suspected 
to play a role in HPV– HNSCC, showed no anatomic preference or fre-
quency or timing differences from other HPV– HNSCC. Genes with 
mutations at later mRT (PK3CA, NFE2L2, HLA-A, SPEN and KMT2C) 
are more likely to be important for progressing to later stages of the 
disease.
In HPV+ HNSCC, gain of chromosome arm 3q and loss of arm 11q are 
both earlier and more frequent than in HPV– HNSCC, indicating impor-
tant early roles during HPV+ progression. We estimate that genomic 
integration of HPV viral DNA occurs early in tumor development, con-
sistent with HPV being the main contributor to cancer initiation.
Arm 3q includes the PIK3CA locus, whose activation by copy num-
ber gain or mutation occurs often in HNSCC43,55,56; 74% of HPV+ and 
62% of HPV– HNSCC showed genetic alterations related to the PIK3CA 
locus. Gain of 3q was found at an earlier mRT in HPV+ tumors (0.05) 
than in HPV– tumors (0.51; Figs. 1e and 2d,e), suggesting a particu-
larly important early role for amplification of PIK3CA in HPV+ disease. 
Notably, however, mutations in PIK3CA, targeted by some therapies57, 
were relatively late in genetic progression in both classes of HNSCC. 
If tumors are less ‘addicted’58 to mutations that occur late in tumor 
development, therapies targeted against PIK3CA mutations might be 
of limited effectiveness.
With respect to loss of 11q in HPV+ HNSCC, ATM stands out as a can-
didate for early involvement in tumorigenesis. Although ATM improves 
the ability of episomal HPV to replicate59,60, its role in protection against 
double-stranded DNA breaks60,61 would be expected to inhibit genomic 
integration of HPV DNA. Losses of 11q also occur in HPV– disease but 
much later at an mRT of 0.67 that we estimate to be near the develop-
ment of carcinoma in situ (Figs. 1e and Fig. 2d,e).
Identifying genes whose loss along with chromosome arm 3p 
promote development of HPV– HNSCC has long been an active area of 
interest62. The surprisingly early timing and high prevalence of 3p loss 
that we also found in HPV+ HNSCC suggests that studies of 3p genes will 
have clinical significance for all HNSCC.
Similarly surprising in HPV+ HNSCC is the prevalence of 17p loss, 
which includes the TP53 locus, occurring in one-quarter of tumors (26 
of 101). As HPV E6 leads to inactivation of the p53 protein product42, 
and TP53 mutations occur in only 3% of HPV+ HNSCC, loss of additional 
genes on 17p presumably are important. Rather than the very early loss 
seen in HPV– tumors, 17p loss occurs at intermediate stages of HPV+ 
disease progression (mRT of 0.66), suggesting that those genes are 
involved in later stages of tumor development.
Using a clock-like mutational signature to convert relative event 
timing estimates to years before diagnosis, we identified that early 
founding events can occur as many as 30–40 years before tumor diag-
nosis in HPV– disease and 20–30 or more years in HPV+ tumors, with HPV 
integration also early in the development. WGD-to-WGT conversion 
seems to follow an abrupt transition model, with a specific transition 
probability per year.
This work helps clarify the nature of outcome-associated genomic 
disruption measures. Almost all tumors with a whole-genome event 
leading to WGT or WGD had high MATH values. Similar to high MATH, 
high FGA was also associated with shorter overall survival in HNSCC 
when therapies and standard clinical and pathologic characteristics 
were taken into account. Measures of genomic disruption can be used 
to classify individuals into high- and low-risk groups for monitor-
ing disease with strategies such as minimal residual disease assays63. 
Identification of WGD timing before invasion might be used to identify 
HPV– HNSCC at higher risk of progression. Other early drivers can be 
the basis of additional therapeutic trials, including in the preventive 
setting for high-risk individuals.
Applying our approach to other cancers whose premalignant tis-
sue is seldom or never obtainable14–22, including multiple rare tumor 
types, could be of great clinical importance. Many such cancers 
have uncertain etiology, with effective treatment avenues less well 
defined than in more prevalent tumors. Establishment of progression

trajectories, early drivers and similarity of progression to other cancer 
types can lead to development of improved disease models, better 
treatment strategies and clinical management and more accurate 
prediction of disease course.
Methods
This research complied with all relevant ethical regulations. Human 
research on individuals at Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE) was 
approved by the MEE Human Studies Committee under protocol HSC 
11-024H, with informed consent obtained from participants. Partici-
pants were not compensated.
Participants, clinical data and tumors
We analyzed data from 486 individuals with head and neck cancer in 
TCGA43 and 45 individuals from MEE with oropharyngeal tumors whose 
WES data met quality control criteria (see below). TCGA clinical data 
were as in previous work50,51. Clinical data from MEE corresponding 
to TCGA data fields were extracted from participant records. Median 
time to death for 218 participants was 13.7 months (IQR of 8.4 to 26.5 
months); follow-up time for the 313 last known to be alive was approxi-
mately twice as long (median of 29.4 months; IQR of 17.1 to 51.2 months). 
HPV status of TCGA tumors was assessed by RNA sequencing43; for MEE 
tumors, clinical HPV annotations were used. Clinical data are provided 
as Source Data for Fig. 5, including information on age and sex. Survival 
analysis was limited to individuals who survived more than 60 d after 
definitive pathologic diagnosis so that associations of outcome with 
adjuvant therapy could be ascertained.
TCGA tumor and control tissue or blood samples were as pre-
viously reported43. Tumor portions from MEE participants were 
frozen at liquid nitrogen temperature; participant-matched frozen 
blood provided control DNA for assessing tumor-specific mutations. 
Twenty-eight of the MEE tumor samples had two subsamples taken for 
separate processing.
WES
Tumors from TCGA had undergone WES or WGS, as described25. Analy-
sis proceeded from paired aligned bam files, which were inputted into 
a standard WES somatic variant-calling pipeline, including MuTect for 
calling somatic SNVs64, Strelka for calling small insertions and dele-
tions65, deTiN for estimating tumor-in-normal contamination66, Con-
tEst for estimating cross-participant contamination67, AllelicCapSeg 
for calling allelic copy number variants68 and ABSOLUTE for estimating 
tumor purity, ploidy, CCFs and absolute allelic copy number68. Artifac-
tual variants were filtered out using a token panel of normals filter, a blat 
filter and an oxoG filter. For TCGA tumors in which the WES data did not 
yield sufficiently high-quality copy number data from AllelicCapSeg 
(361 tumors), we used HapSeg on single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) arrays as a substitute step. MEE tumors underwent a similar 
variant-calling pipeline as the TCGA tumors, but we did not substitute 
any AllelicCapSeg results with HapSeg on SNP arrays.
Signature analysis for CoMut plots
We performed SBS signature analysis separately on the HPV– and HPV+ 
subsets using SignatureAnalyzer69,70 on the somatic SNV calls resulting 
from the variant-calling pipeline.
PhylogicNDT
We used PhylogicNDT to estimate relative event timing within individ-
ual tumors (SinglePatientTiming) and to combine timing information 
among tumors (LeagueModel). This analysis suite has been described 
in detail elsewhere26.
Within-tumor timing. After ABSOLUTE analysis68 to determine 
purity and ploidy, allele-specific SNV multiplicity estimates and 
purity-corrected copy number variation values from WES or WGS 
reads were used to set a within-tumor partial ordering of events. 
For example, on a chromosomal region that has been doubled, a 
tumor-specific mutation present at two copies is timed before the 
doubling, while a mutation present at only one copy is timed after the 
doubling. Tumor-specific genetic events are mapped on a π scale (as a 
probability distribution) from 0 to 1 (refs. 23,26), representing the first 
and last clonal genetic events. Estimated distributions are corrected for 
power to detect based on coverage profiles. The proportion of clonal 
events per megabase occurring before each genetic event in a tumor 
is defined as the π score for that event. Clonal events that cannot be 
timed are assigned a uniform π distribution, and the last clonal and all 
subclonal events are assigned π scores of 1, represented as a delta func-
tion δ(π − 1). Uncertainties arising from sequencing are incorporated 
into a distribution of π values for each event within the tumor. Thus 
within-tumor timing uses information from all tumor-specific SNV 
and copy number variation events.
Across-tumor timing. PhylogicNDT LeagueModel uses a Bayesian 
Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) approach to combine single-tumor 
π-score distributions for each genetic event shared among a number 
of tumors into a consensus genetic relative timing progression. This 
consensus relative timing is generated by repeated sampling from the 
single-tumor π distributions of the shared events among multiple sub-
sets of tumors. On this relative timing scale, a value of 0 represents the 
earliest shared event, and 1 is the last clonal shared event. The result is 
a distribution of relative timing scores for each shared event among the 
tumors based on comparison of within-tumor π scores among shared 
events. This was repeated for 200 iterations via resampling at an average 
of 63% without replacement, and the union of the relative timing score 
traces for each iteration was used as the final timing score distribution.
Timing comparisons. To compare consensus genetic progressions 
between HPV+ and HPV– HNSCC or between subsets of HPV– tumors, 
we performed a similar MCMC approach to the LeagueModel algo-
rithm, but for each resampling iteration, we calculated the difference 
in the relative timing scores between subsets. Point estimates for tim-
ing differences were calculated as the median of the final trace, and 
one-way P values were calculated as the proportion of trace samples 
that was greater than 0. These were converted to two-way P values 
(P2-way = 1 − 2|0.5 − P1-way|) and then to q values using multiple hypothesis 
correction.
Real-time timing of somatic events
To estimate the real-time timing of somatic events, we used a robust 
linear regression model by removing the top and bottom 5% of slope 
outliers to fit the rate of clonal CpG>T (the ‘aging’ signature, SBS1) 
mutations (total number of mutations/number of covered CpG sites) 
corrected for copy number and multiplicity as a function of the age at 
diagnosis (Extended Data Fig. 5a) across different anatomical sites. 
The CpG>T rate per year and participant age were used to calculate the 
posterior distribution of the individual somatic event real-time timing 
measured from the π-score distribution calculated by using only CpG>T 
mutations with PhylogicNDT SinglePatientTiming. The resulting dis-
tribution for a specific event was then combined across participants 
to produce a cohort-level distribution for the typical time of the event 
in terms of years before diagnosis. Timing of HPV integration events 
was performed by aligning structural variation breakpoints and span-
ning reads at 53 integration sites across 11 individuals with available 
WGS data and performing a similar timing analysis as for mutations 
(using local copy number and clonal multiplicity). Because APOBEC 
mutations are often clustered near HPV integration sites, we excluded 
APOBEC mutations for the timing estimate. Often several integration 
sites were identified per participant, and sites on copy number regions 
with the earliest estimate of real time were used as representative for 
the participant.

Measures of intratumor genetic heterogeneity
MATH was calculated per tumor sample as previously described48. 
For tumors represented by two separately sequenced samples, MATH 
values were averaged.
A tumor’s ploidy group was assigned based on the fraction of the 
genome in diploid, triploid and tetraploid states. Tumors with a dip-
loid fraction of >0.65 were classified as diploid, non-diploid tumors 
with a fraction triploid of >0.35 were classified as triploid, and other 
non-diploid tumors were classified as tetraploid.
A whole-genome event was called if at least half of chromosome 
arms were amplified or at least four chromosome arms were amplified 
on both alleles. Further classification into triploidy (WGT) or dou-
bling (WGD) was based on the corresponding ploidy group (triploid 
or tetraploid).
The FGA absent a whole-genome event was the fraction of the 
genome deviating by more than 0.2 from a value of one copy for either 
allele. With a whole-genome event, FGA was calculated as the fraction 
of genome deviating by more than 0.2 from a value of two copies for 
either allele.
Statistical analysis and reproducibility
No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. As there 
were no groups defined by experimental manipulations, no blinding 
was performed. Random resampling is inherent in PhylogicNDT, as 
described above.
Event prevalence comparisons, associations among measures 
of intratumor heterogeneity and other routine analyses were per-
formed with standard statistical routines in Python or R. Frequentist 
tests (except for inherently one-sided chi-square statistics) were 
two sided. The Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate correc-
tion was applied to event prevalence comparison P values within 
each HNSCC subset. Survival analysis used the survival71 (version 
3.3-1) and rms72 (version 6.3-0) packages under version 4.2.0 of R73, 
extending a previously described model for HNSCC survival51. Cox 
survival models were stratified by anatomic site to satisfy the pro-
portional hazards assumption, and model calibration was checked 
by bootstrap resampling.

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Timing within the NOTCH1-mutated subset of HPV- 
HNSCC. (a) Relative Timing of genetic events, based on 79 NOTCH1-mutated 
HPV-negative HNSCCs. Analysis compared 43 events among tumors: whole-
genome amplification (WGD, doubling; WGT, triploidy) and other events 
with notable prevalence among HPV-negative tumors (arm losses with > 30% 
prevalence, SNV with > 5% prevalence). (b) Relative timing between NOTCH1-
mutated and all HPV-negative tumors of 42 events (all events from panel a 
excluding NOTCH1) (N = 79 NOTCH1-mutated patients). Violin plots show the 
distributions of difference in timing between the groups. Associated log10 
q-values are displayed at the top. (c) MRT timing profiles for NOTCH1 activating 
and deactivating mutations (d) Power analysis through down sampling of higher 
prevalence events, demonstrating dependence of the confidence interval size on 
event prevalence (N = 421 HPV- patients).
