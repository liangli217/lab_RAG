How the genomic features of a patient’s cancer relate to individual disease kinetics remains poorly understood. 
Here we used the indolent growth dynamics of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to analyse the growth rates 
and corresponding genomic patterns of leukaemia cells from 107 patients with CLL, spanning decades-long disease 
courses. We found that CLL commonly demonstrates not only exponential expansion but also logistic growth, which 
is sigmoidal and reaches a certain steady-state level. Each growth pattern was associated with marked differences in 
genetic composition, the pace of disease progression and the extent of clonal evolution. In a subset of patients, whose 
serial samples underwent next-generation sequencing, we found that dynamic changes in the disease course of CLL 
were shaped by the genetic events that were already present in the early slow-growing stages. Finally, by analysing 
the growth rates of subclones compared with their parental clones, we quantified the growth advantage conferred by 
putative CLL drivers in vivo.
Although recent genomic characterizations of cancer have provided 
a wealth of knowledge, the linking of genetic features of individual 
cancers with their phenotype has been largely lacking. The rate and 
pattern of growth can vary among patients with cancer, and various 
growth patterns have been used to describe cancer expansion1–10. The 
two most commonly used models are exponential unbounded growth 
and sigmoidal growth, which stabilizes at a specific carrying capacity 
(for example, logistic growth). However, analyses of cancer growth 
patterns have so far either relied on samples with few data points per 
tumour or come from in vitro or mouse studies.
CLL is an informative model system for studying natural cancer 
growth, as it has a highly variable but often relatively indolent course, 
with treatment commonly withheld for months to decades until 
clinically necessary11. Temporally dense tumour measurements are 
feasible by serial venipuncture, which enables the analysis of growth 
dynamics. The availability of highly pure tumour samples has already 
yielded rich, unbiased genetic characterization, leading to our current 
detailed understanding of the genomic attributes in CLL12–16. Here, we 
undertake an integrative analysis of genetic data, clinical information 
and growth dynamics, including quantification of the effect of can-
cer mutations on growth rates measured in serial samples collected 
from 21 patients before therapy. We then corroborated the results in 
86 independent patients with CLL, improving our understanding of 
the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes in cancer. Thus, we 
established a methodology and quantitative framework to model cancer 
growth observed directly from human patients, helping to explain the 
variation in the clinical behaviour of CLL.
Patterns of growth and genetic evolution in CLL
We identified 21 patients with CLL with serial samples collected between 
diagnosis and the start of treatment (Supplementary Table 1a). The time to 
the initiation of treatment ranged from 2.1 to 15.6 years (median 5.7). The 
cohort was balanced for the strong prognostic marker of the mutational 
status of the IGH variable region (IGHV)17 (Supplementary Methods). To 
assess the overall growth of the leukaemia in each patient, we evaluated 4 
to 83 (median 22) pre-treatment measurements of peripheral white blood 
cell (WBC) counts per patient, the vast majority of which reflect CLL 
cells. A subset of patients exhibited bounded growth, with WBC counts 
plateauing over time, which suggests that the leukaemia can display logis-
tic-like behaviour, whereas another distinct subset clearly demonstrated 
an exponential-like growth pattern (Fig. 1a, b, Extended Data Fig. 1b). We 
therefore devised a unified Bayesian model based on a logistic pattern, 
as it can model both predominant growth behaviours. In this context, 
the posterior probabilities of the growth rate (r) and carrying capacity 
(K) were estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Gibbs 
sampler (Supplementary Methods). The dynamics of patient WBC counts 
that resulted in carrying capacities confidently below 1,000 × 109 cells per 
litre were classified as exhibiting logistic (LOG) growth, whereas those 
confidently above 1,000 × 109 cells per litre were categorized as displaying 
exponential-like (EXP) growth. Those cases that could not be confidently 
attributed to either of the categories were classified as having indetermi-
nate (IND) growth patterns.
Using this classification scheme, five patients exhibited LOG growth 
behaviour, with stabilization at estimated carrying capacities of 
71 × 109–264 × 109 cells per litre (Supplementary Methods). In ten

patients, the CLL cells exhibited EXP growth, with growth rates 
of 14–99% per year (median: 48% per year). Finally, in six patients, 
CLL growth could not be categorized with certainty as either LOG 
or EXP, either because of the short period of observation (patients 
12 and 17) or owing to complex patterns of growth (patients 7, 8, 10 
and 15) (Extended Data Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 1). CLLs with 
LOG growth tended to have a longer time to treatment, with a median 
of 8.3 years (range 4.1–15.6) compared with 5.6 years (2.4–11.9) for 
EXP patients and 4.6 years (2.1–13.7) for the IND category; however, 
this difference was not significant across the three groups (P = 0.19, 
Kruskal–Wallis test; Supplementary Table 1a). Patients with LOG 
growth (4 out of 5) tended to have mutated IGHV—which is prognos-
tically favourable—more frequently than patients with EXP growth (3 
out of 10; P = 0.12; Fig. 1c).
To examine whether genetic differences underlie the distinct patterns 
of growth, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis 
(median coverage of 107×) on a median of 3 (range 2–6) CLL samples 
per patient collected before receiving therapy, spanning 0.77–10.62 
(median 3.28) years between the first and last available pre-treatment 
time points (Supplementary Tables 1b and 2). Consistent with previ-
ous studies12,13, we detected a median overall somatic mutation fre-
quency of 0.79 per megabase (Mb) across patients, with frequencies of 
0.19 per Mb of silent events and 0.60 per Mb for non-silent somatic 
single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) and 0.031 per Mb for somatic inser-
tions and deletions (sIndels) (Supplementary Table 3). In addition, we 
identified somatic copy number alterations directly from the WES data 
(Supplementary Table 4).
By comparing with previously identified putative CLL drivers12,13 
(Supplementary Tables 5 and 6), we identified at least one driver in all 
21 patients. We further examined whether the detected CLL drivers 
were clonal or subclonal by inferring their cancer cell fraction (CCF)15 
(Supplementary Methods). The total number of driver mutations was 
lowest in patients whose CLLs demonstrated LOG growth (median 1, 
range 1–4) compared with those with IND growth (median 2, range 
1–2), or EXP growth (median 4, range 2–7) (P = 0.005). We identified 
a trend towards a higher number of clonal drivers and an increased 
number of subclonal drivers in samples with EXP growth compared 
to those with LOG or IND growth (P = 0.13 and 0.019, respectively). 
Finally, we saw that, even without therapy, clones with CLL drivers, 
occurring in samples with EXP growth, exhibited larger shifts in their 
clonal fractions compared with clones in samples with IND and LOG 
growth (P = 0.033; Extended Data Fig. 2a, b). Most subclones with 
drivers present at the time of treatment were already detectable in the 
earliest samples.
Validation of global growth patterns
To confirm these findings, we studied an independent cohort of 
samples collected from 85 patients with previous characterization by 
WES, having at least four consecutive pre-treatment WBC measure-
ments no more than two years apart14,15 (Supplementary Methods). 
Unlike the discovery cohort, patients in the extension cohort were not 
specifically selected to have undergone subsequent treatment. WES 
analysis was performed on samples collected at a median of 2.2 years 
(range 0, 18.9) after diagnosis. Of the 38 patients who subsequently 
underwent treatment, the median time from diagnosis to treatment 
was 2.6 years (range 0–18.9) (Supplementary Table 7). A median of 18 
(range 4–73) pre-treatment measurements of circulating WBCs were 
available per patient.
As for the discovery cohort, we classified these 85 patients into 
LOG, EXP and IND growth categories (Supplementary Methods, 
Supplementary Table 8). Of 85 CLLs, 43 (51%) showed LOG growth 
(median estimated carrying capacity of 70 × 109 cells per litre, range 
4–360), 12 showed EXP growth (14%; median growth rate 44, range 
17–64%), and 30 had IND growth (35%; median growth rate 33%, 
range 4–197%) (Fig. 2a–c, Extended Data Figs. 2c, 3). Within CLLs 
categorized as having IND growth, 13 out of 30 (43%) had a short 
period of observation, 15 (50%) had a pattern of growth that appeared 
intermediate between LOG and EXP or was complex, and 2 (7%) had 
unevenly distributed data.
Consistent with the results in the discovery cohort, we again found 
that the mutated status of IGHV was most enriched in patients with 
LOG growth (P = 0.002). Similarly, we found a difference in the 
number of total, clonal and subclonal drivers among the groups, with 
larger values in patients with EXP growth (P = 0.022, P = 0.011 and 
P = 0.017, respectively; Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 7a, b). Even 
among the 42 patients with known IGHV status in the LOG group, the 
4 patients with unmutated IGHV had higher carrying capacities than 
the 38 patients with mutated IGHV (median of 189.2 × 109 versus 
64.4 × 109 cells per litre; P = 0.017). We observed that samples with 
LOG growth had a higher proportion of patients that had either no 
known driver event or only del(13q) (51% LOG, 24% IND and 0% 
EXP; P = 0.001). In addition, the EXP group had a higher proportion 
of trisomy 12 than the IND and LOG cases (42% versus 10% and 9%, 
P = 0.027).
More patients with EXP and IND growth progressed to treatment 
than those with LOG growth (75%, 67% and 21%, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2d). 
We modelled the probability of treatment using univariable exact logis-
tic regression and stepwise multivariable logistic regression. We con-
sidered age, sex, growth pattern (EXP versus LOG, IND versus LOG), 
IGHV status, fluorescence in situ hybridization cytogenetics, number 
of drivers, and the maximum and last available WBC count before 
treatment as potential covariates to assess their relative contribution 
to clinical outcome (Supplementary Methods). In univariable analy-
sis, growth pattern, IGHV status, del(13q), last available WBC count 
and the number of total and clonal drivers were significant. The final 
multivariable model included growth rate pattern, del(13q) and last

nificantly (EXP versus LOG: P = 0.032; IND versus LOG: P = 0.002) 
to a model that already included del(13q) and the last available WBC 
count (Fig. 2e).
Growth patterns and evolution of relapse
Because clonal shifts were common in CLLs with more aggressive pat-
terns of growth, we asked whether the growth pattern also affected 
clonal evolution after therapy. Of the 21 patients in the discovery 
cohort, 12 relapsed (median time from first until next treatment 1.88 
years; range 0.52–5.56). Ten of these twelve patients had available 
post-treatment samples, which we also characterized by WES analysis.
Six of these ten patients had clear evidence of clonal evolu-
tion, characterized by a significant shift in the CCF (by 11–100%; 
Supplementary Methods) in at least one subclone (Fig. 3a, Extended 
Data Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 9). In the other four patients, sub-
clones retained interclonal balance even after cytoreductive treatment 
(Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 4b). In two out of six evolving leukae-
mias, we observed evidence of convergent evolution, with several 
branches affecting the same pathway. In patient 5, clone 5 with the 
mutation encoding GNB1(I80T) disappeared, but a distinct clone with 
GNB1(I80N) emerged together with a mutation in CDKN2A. In patient 
13, one allele of ATM was clonally mutated and the second allele had a 
distinct subclonal mutation of ATM. After chemotherapy, the mutated 
ATM subclone was replaced by an expanding clone with del(11q) that 
encompassed ATM and BIRC3 on one allele, and two mutations in 
BIRC3 on the other. The four other patients with clonal evolution after 
relapse also revealed emergence of clones with driver events (Extended 
Data Fig. 4). All six patients with therapy-related clonal evolution of 
CLL exhibited EXP growth before treatment (growth rates of 14–99% 
per year). By contrast, patients with preserved clonal architecture 
despite therapy had CLL with either LOG or IND growth (with growth 
rates < 31% per year) (Fig. 3a, b, Extended Data Fig. 4). In patients 
from our previously reported study15, we found a similar association 
(Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Table 1c). Three of the

four patients with data available to evaluate growth patterns (three 
patients included in the validation cohort of n = 85 plus one addi-
tional patient) had evolving clonal structure after relapse, and an IND 
or EXP growth pattern before treatment (growth rates of 32%, 64% 
and 138% per year), whereas the fourth patient with preserved clonal 
architecture despite therapy exhibited IND growth (Fig. 3, bars with 
asterisks). Overall, these results support the close association between 
the growth of leukaemia before treatment and clonal evolution after 
chemotherapy (P = 0.003).
Growth patterns of subclones
To identify whether distinct growth dynamics could be discerned 
among subclones underlying the overall growth patterns, we used infor-
mation from macroscopic subclones (that is, having CCFs of ≥10% 
at one or more time points) to derive probable phylogenies for each 
patient (Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Table 10, Extended 
Data Figs. 5–7). Using PhylogicNDT18, we identified subclones by 
n-dimensional clustering of CCFs of individual events across samples, 
estimated their phylogenetic relationships, and modelled the growth 
dynamics of each subclone (Supplementary Methods). We focused on 
the five patients with WES from four or more pre-treatment time points 
(patients 1, 4, 5, 18 and 19).
Of interest, even with overall LOG growth in the leukaemias of 
patients 4, 18 and 19, several subclones displayed behaviour consistent 
with EXP growth. Two out of four subclones (clones 1 and 3) of patient 4 
had plateauing growth rates and even showed a decline in growth at 
the latest time point (Fig. 4a). By contrast, the growth of clone 2 was 
consistent with EXP growth, providing in vivo evidence of competition 
among subclones within an overall picture of LOG growth of the bulk 
tumour. It is possible that the growth pattern of this CLL would become 
EXP after takeover of the cancer cell population by clone 2. In the other 
two patients, most clones exhibited complex dynamics that did not 
follow simple exponential or logistic patterns (Extended Data Fig. 6b). 
Clone 3 of patient 19 exhibited mild exponential growth over time. 
The other clones were mostly stable with fluctuations in their abun-
dance. Thus, for cases with overall LOG growth, we observed that 
complex underlying intraclonal dynamics can result in net carrying 
capacity.
Patients 1 and 5, who had CLL with EXP growth, also revealed 
diverse interclonal dynamics (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Figs. 6, 7). Most 
subclones of patient 1 exhibited growth consistent with EXP patterns, 
with the later subclone (clone 4) probably showing faster exponential 
growth. In patient 5, the strongly growing subclones (clones 4 and 5) 
were only present in the last two time points, and thus we only tested 
clones 1–3 for behaviour consistent with EXP growth. Although the 
growth pattern of clone 1 did not fit an exponential pattern, both 
branches (clones 2 and 3) appeared to contribute to the overall EXP 
growth pattern of this case.
For added confidence and validation of the WES results, we also 
performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of serial samples 
from a subset of cases with EXP (patients 1 and 6) and LOG (patient 4) 
growth patterns. The WGS results were concordant with those based 
on the WES data, while providing narrower credible intervals on the 
subclonal composition owing to an approximately 10-fold higher num-
ber of mutations per clone (Supplementary Methods, Extended Data 
Figs. 8, 9a–e).
Growth advantage of subclonal drivers
To quantify the growth advantage of individual subclones, we calcu-
lated the differences in growth rate (ΔGR) between child and parent 
clones (Supplementary Methods). We evaluated whether subclonal 
growth rates differed based on the presence or absence of known CLL 
drivers and if they had a significant selective advantage compared 
with the parent clone (Prob[ΔGR > 0] > 0.95, which corresponds to 
P < 0.05) (Supplementary Table 11). We focused this analysis on the 35 
subclones detected in 16 patients whose leukaemias displayed overall 
non-logistic WBC expansion (because those with overall LOG growth 
lacked abundant drivers). We inferred the distribution of growth rates 
of individual subclones and the differences to their parents using an 
MCMC-based method that samples an ensemble of likely phylogenetic 
trees for each patient (PhylogicNDT GrowthKinetics18; Supplementary 
Methods). The model also takes into account the number of reads sup-
porting each somatic mutation, tumour purity, absolute copy number, 
and the WBC measurements (Extended Data Fig. 5d).
Indeed, 7 subclones from 6 patients (patients 1, 5, 6, 9, 13 and 14) 
contained a known CLL driver and their growth was significantly 
higher than their parent subclone (Fig. 5a, Extended Data Fig. 9f). 
The strongest accelerations were associated with second hits in the 
tumour suppressor genes TP53 or ATM (ΔGR of 127% and 90% per 
year for clone 4 of patient 1 and clone 2 of patient 13, respectively). For 
patient 14, one subclone with several driver mutations (XPO1, del(13q) 
del(15q)) also expanded more rapidly than its parent (ΔGR of 57% 
per year). The CLL of patient 5 showed high overall growth driven 
by the two independent subclones containing mutations in MED12 
and GNB1 (ΔGR of 41%, and 78% per year, respectively). We further 
saw strong growth acceleration in patient 6 (ASXL1, ΔGR of 82% per 
year) and in patient 9 (KRAS, ΔGR of 34% per year). These analyses 
provide an in vivo measurement and functional evidence of the can-
cer-driving capacity of these mutations. One subclone (from patient 7) 
had a growth rate indicative of a fitness advantage compared with its 
parent but without a known CLL driver (Extended Data Fig. 9g). Its 
estimated ΔGR was lower than that of subclones with known drivers 
(ΔGR of 16% (±10% s.d.) per year). Another set of 8 subclones from 
4 patients were identified to have mutations in known CLL drivers, 
but lacked a significant growth advantage compared with their parent 
subclone (for example, clone 2 in patient 3 with mutated CARD11; 
ΔGR 10%, P = 0.20; Extended Data Fig. 9h). Finally, more than half 
of the subclones (19 out of 35) from 12 patients appeared as ‘passenger’ 
subclones with no relative advantage compared with the parental clones

and without any known CLL driver. These subclones possibly represent 
genetic drift19,20 or may have had an advantage for a short period of 
time (for example, clone 1 in patient 10, Fig. 5b).
In 7 out of 16 patients, we observed more than one class of subclonal 
growth simultaneously (Extended Data Fig. 7). Subclones with known 
CLL drivers were more likely to have accelerated growth relative to 
their parent (15 clones, median ΔGR of 0.23 (interquartile range (IQR) 
0.02–0.71)) compared with subclones without additional known drivers 
(20 clones, with median ΔGR of −0.07 (IQR −0.23–0.13); P = 0.013, 
in a linear mixed model) (Fig. 5c).
Finally, patients 1, 5, 6, 9 and 13 CLL had subclones with accelerated 
growth and branched phylogenies, providing opportunities to exam-
ine the relative fitness advantage that is conferred by drivers to the  
subclone within specific genetic contexts. For example, the acquisition 
of amp(5q34) and del(17p) in clone 4 (patient 1) seems to confer faster 
growth than clones with the TP53 mutation alone (clone 2), del(11q) 
and amp(8q) (clone 1) or with the FAM50A mutation (clone 3) in 
the context of clonal SF3B1 mutation. Similarly, in patient 6, clone 
3 had a mutation in ASXL1 in the context of clonal del(13q) and 
del(11p) and expanded faster than a sibling clone having amp(2p) 
and del(6q) mutations. With sufficiently large multi-time point sequenc-
ing datasets and overall tumour burden information (that is, WBC 
counts), comparing the growth of sibling clones will enable the construc-
tion of a map of the fitness of driver events in specific genetic contexts.
Discussion
Many mathematical models have been proposed to describe cancer 
growth in patients, but with no consensus7–9. Previous works reported 
exponential growth in leukaemia, lung, liver and breast cancer7,8, and sig-
moidal growth (such as logistic or Gompertz) in earlier studies of breast 
cancer4,5 and in xenografts derived from human colorectal cancer6. 
Our study shows that individual cancers of the same type can exhibit 
diverse growth patterns: whereas many patients with CLL exhibited 
exponential-like growth with high or unbounded carrying capacity, 
in others, the disease achieved a—potentially temporary—stable state, 
and exhibited a logistic-like pattern with finite carrying capacity. For 
these distinct growth classes, we further identified clear differences 
in genetic attributes and clinical outcomes: exponential growth was 
associated with a larger number of CLL drivers, greater subclonal 
dynamics and an earlier need for treatment. Conversely, logistic growth 
was associated with a narrower spectrum of genetic alterations, fewer 
subclonal drivers, and interclonal stability even in relapse after treat-
ment. We and others previously noted that del(13q) and trisomy 12 
are probable early events in CLL phylogeny13,21, and we found that 
the presence of del(13q) is associated with logistic growth, whereas 
trisomy 12 was associated with exponential growth. Our multivariable 
analysis demonstrated that the incorporation of growth pattern behav-
iour provides additional explanatory power above that provided by the 
presence of the strong prognostic cytogenetic marker of del(13q)22, and 
was stronger than the mutational status of IGHV17. Furthermore, the 
genetic diversity of CLL seems to be established early in the disease, 
consistent with previously reported smaller series23–25. In the absence of 
therapeutic perturbations, the observed rate and pattern of outgrowth 
of CLL over time thus seems to ‘play out’ the pre-determined genetic 
and clonal composition. Of note, the growth rates of these clones from 
untreated patients are several-fold lower than that of relapse clones 
we previously reported in patients receiving ibrutinib2. Recent studies 
to characterize genetically the premalignant states of solid tumours26, 
and of monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis27,28 (considered a precursor 
condition of CLL), have further supported the idea that the extent 
of genetic diversity of malignancies such as CLL long predates its full-
blown clinical picture.
Our approach of integrating patient tumour burden measurements 
and sequencing data from several disease time points provides a 
conceptual framework for understanding the growth trajectories of 
individual populations of CLL cells. We detected evidence of in vivo 
competition among subclones in early CLL and more atypical behav-
iours that could not be categorized using simple models, extending

previously reported insights on CLL evolution during later periods of 
the disease course29–31. For example, in a subset of patients, we observed 
a shift from overall logistic growth, with many years spent at carrying 
capacity, to exponential growth.
Finally, our computational framework enabled us to quantify 
the degree of growth acceleration and fitness of genetically defined 
subclones over their parental clones. Accelerated growth was strongly 
enriched in subclones with well-established CLL drivers. Thus, we 
provide evidence of ongoing evolution in vivo, with clear growth- 
accelerating roles and potential synergies of driver mutations. We also 
find frequent existence of growth-neutral subclones without drivers, 
probably representing genetic drift19,20. These fundamental findings 
are especially relevant to the ongoing efforts of precision oncology, in 
which the estimation of clonal growth dynamics in individual patients 
may inform therapy and predict the course of their disease.

Extended Data Fig. 1 | Growth kinetics of naturally progressing CLLs 
from the discovery cohort. a, Time courses of the discovery CLL cohort 
(Supplementary Table 1). Circles indicate time points of samples analysed 
by WES. Dotted lines represent course of CLL from diagnosis (left vertical 
line) until last follow-up (arrows) or death (right vertical line), and solid 
lines indicate timeframe covered by the analysis of serial samples by WES, 
coloured by growth pattern. b, Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of 
posterior probabilities for carrying capacity K obtained from the Bayesian 
model based on a logistic growth pattern for patients. Categorizations of 
the growth pattern of the individual patients are marked. c, Classification 
of patients based on the probability that their carrying capacity K is 
below 1,000 (×109 cells per litre) (red numbers in top left corner). Also 
shown are the posterior probability distributions for all model parameters 
(carrying capacity K, growth rate r, WBC count at diagnosis X0 and 
variance of the noise σ2). Far right panels per patient: leukaemia burden 
information provided by WBC measurements (blue dots), with ten 
random fits from the Bayesian model. Red numbers in top left corners 
indicate time (years) from diagnosis to first treatment.

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Growth kinetics of CLLs from the extension 
cohort. a–c, Shown are samples displaying: logistic growth (n = 43) (a), 
indeterminate growth (n = 30) (b) or exponential growth (n = 12) (c). See 
Supplementary Table 8 for information on growth pattern fitting. Blue dots 
denote WBC measurements; coloured lines denote ten random growth 
model fits (see Supplementary Methods). Red numbers indicate years from 
diagnosis to first treatment for patients who progressed to treatment.

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Clonal shifts and growth rates in untreated CLL 
patients. a, The increase in the numbers of total (top), clonal (middle) and 
subclonal (bottom) drivers is associated with overall leukaemia growth 
patterns. P values were determined by Kruskal–Wallis test. b, A trend 
towards increased maximal change in the CCF of a driver event is observed 
between the first and last pre-treatment samples of a given patient based 
on growth pattern. P values were determined by Kruskal–Wallis test.  
c, Top, probability of having a carrying capacity K of WBC of less 
than 1,000 × 109 cells per litre (blue dots) for patients with logistic, 
indeterminate or exponential growth patterns. Bottom, growth rates  
(small circles) together with 70% credible intervals (lines) across the 
discovery and extension samples, ordered based on the probability of 
logistic growth with samples classified as displaying logistic, indeterminate 
or exponential growth.

Extended Data Fig. 4 | Assessment of evolutionary dynamics using 
sample pairs. Changes in the CCF of subclones represented as two-
dimensional pair-wise plots of multi-sample clustering results. Samples 
at a time point (TP) closest to diagnosis (first) versus the last sample 
before treatment (preTx) are shown in the left column; samples at the 
last time point before and the first time point after treatment are shown 
in the right column. a, b, Patients are grouped based on those having: 
subclones with significant evolution (a) or subclones that maintain 
interclonal balance (b). Significantly evolving subclones are indicated in 
orange (Supplementary Methods); expanding CLL driver mutations are 
coloured magenta. c, Examples of genetic evolution from the first to last 
pre-treatment time points, and from pre-treatment to relapse samples 
for patient 6 (with significant evolution) and patient 10 (not evolving). 
Shown are the two-dimensional distributions that reflect the average of the 
positional distributions of the cluster centres along the MCMC iterations, 
rather than the final posterior for the cluster centre, which is determined 
by the normalized product of the pre-clustered distributions of the 
mutations that were finally assigned to each cluster. Marginal distributions 
(on the x and y axes) depict the CCF distributions before clustering for 
each individual mutation. Final cluster assignment is indicated by the 
colour.

Extended Data Fig. 5 | Detecting subclones and construction of 
evolutionary phylogenies using simulated data. a, Bar plots showing the 
fraction of clustering results on simulated samples that are concordant 
with the ground truth (or differ by ∆n clusters). Simulations are grouped 
by low (2) and high (3–8) numbers of samples per case as well as low 
(2–9) and high (≥10) numbers of mutation per subclone. b, Similar 
CCF accuracy after clustering between simulated WES and WGS 
data. c, Simulation of a case with 5 samples and 5 subclones present at 
different CCF levels per sample (black lines denote ground truth). The 
predicted CCF distributions for each cluster are plotted as a function 
of the number of mutations in the subclone (from 2 to 100). When the 
number of mutations exceeds approximately 15–20, the CCF predictions 
become stable and accurate (low bias and variance). d, Examples of 
PhylogicNDT BuildTree algorithm results applied to simulated data. Grey 
shading highlights the correct tree, with percentage of MCMC iterations 
supporting the trees indicated. e, Analysis of prior selection for clustering. 
For a range of priors with varying mean number of clusters, K, the prior 
for α is computed, and the Dirichlet process posteriors for α and K 
illustrate how the choice of prior affects the estimation of K. f, Pigeon-
hole principle: for two clusters, A and B (top), the convolution (middle) 
and difference (bottom) is illustrated. The area above 1.0 CCF of the 
convolution is consistent with the probability that they are parent–child 
rather than siblings. The area below 0.0 CCF of the difference represents 
the probability that cluster B is more prevalent than cluster A.

Extended Data Table 1 | Exact logistic regression modelling of the probability of treatment
Models include the 79 out of 85 patients having complete data for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) cytogenetics, IGHV mutational status, mutations, and WBC information. From the 85,  
6 patients were excluded from modelling (n = 1 for no sequencing, 1 for missing both IGHV status and FISH cytogenetics, 1 for missing IGHV status, and 3 for missing FISH cytogenetics).  
Final multivariable model included growth rate pattern, del(13q) and last WBC. The probability of treatment was measured using univariable exact logistic regression and stepwise multivariable  
logistic regression.
