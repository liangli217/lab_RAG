SUMMARY
Clonal evolution is a key feature of cancer progres-
sion and relapse. We studied intratumoral heteroge-
neity in 149 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
cases by integrating whole-exome sequence and
copy number to measure the fraction of cancer cells
harboring each somatic mutation. We identiﬁed
driver
mutations
as predominantly clonal
(e.g.,
MYD88, trisomy 12, and del(13q)) or subclonal (e.g.,
SF3B1 and TP53), corresponding to earlier and later
events in CLL evolution. We sampled leukemia cells
from 18 patients at two time points. Ten of twelve
CLL cases treated with chemotherapy (but only one
of six without treatment) underwent clonal evolution,
predominantly involving subclones with driver muta-
tions (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53) that expanded over
time. Furthermore, presence of a subclonal driver
mutation was an independent risk factor for rapid
disease
progression.
Our
study
thus
uncovers
patterns of clonal evolution in CLL, providing insights
into its stepwise transformation, and links the pres-
ence of subclones with adverse clinical outcomes.
INTRODUCTION
Recent genomic studies have revealed that individual cancer
samples are genetically heterogeneous and contain subclonal
populations (Carter et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2012; Gerlinger
et al., 2012; Mullighan et al., 2008; Navin et al., 2011; Nik-Zainal
et al., 2012; Shah et al., 2012). Indeed, tumors likely evolve
through competition
and
interactions
between
genetically
diverse clones (Snuderl et al., 2011). While the existence of intra-
tumoral subclones has long been appreciated, little is known
about the frequency, identity, and evolution of subclonal genetic
alterations or their impact on clinical course.
To examine the evolution and impact of subclonal mutations,
we focused on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a slow-
growing B cell malignancy with disease onset in older individ-
uals. CLL shows a highly variable disease course, partly
explained by the diverse combinations of somatic mutations
uncovered by sequencing studies (Quesada et al., 2012; Wang
et al., 2011). We hypothesized that the presence, diversity, and
evolutionary dynamics of subclonal mutations in CLL also
contribute to the variations observed in disease tempo and
response to therapy (Schuh et al., 2012; Stilgenbauer et al.,
2007). Importantly, the slow growth of CLL-B cells (relative to
other malignancies) provides an extended window for observing
the process of clonal evolution, as it may take months to years for
a new clone to fully replace previous clones (Schuh et al., 2012;
Wu, 2012).
Subclonal mutations in CLL have been detected by ﬂuores-
cence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Shanafelt et al., 2008) and
microarrays (Grubor et al., 2009), showing that they harbor driver
lesions and evolve over time. Because these methods can only
be used to detect a limited number of genetic alterations, more
recent studies have used whole-genome sequencing to quantify
thousands of somatic mutations per sample and track subclones

by clustering alterations of similar allelic frequency (Ding et al.,
2012; Egan et al., 2012; Nik-Zainal et al., 2012; Schuh et al.,
2012; Shah et al., 2012; Walter et al., 2012). However, because
genome-wide sequencing is currently not feasibly applied to
large sample collections, the patterns of clonal evolution and
their effects on disease course have not been fully elucidated.
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) (Gnirke et al., 2009) of
tumors is an affordable, rapid, and comprehensive technology
for detecting somatic coding mutations. We sought to reﬁne
and apply a method for analysis of subclonal mutations using
WES because: (1) the high sequencing depth obtained by WES
(typically 1003–1503) enables reliable detection of subclonal
mutations required for deﬁning subclones and tracking them
over time (Cibulskis et al., 2013); (2) coding mutations likely
encompass many of the important driver events that provide
ﬁtness advantage for speciﬁc clones, and ﬁnally; and (3) the rela-
tively low cost of WES permits studies of large cohorts, which is
key for understanding the relative ﬁtness and temporal order of
driver mutations and for assessing the impact of clonal heteroge-
neity on disease outcome.
To this end, we performed large-scale WES of 160 CLL tumor/
normal pairs that represented the broad clinical spectrum of
CLL. In particular, we examined the roles of CLL subclones
and the mutations that they harbor by integrative analysis of
coding mutations and somatic copy number alterations, which
enabled estimation of the cancer cell fraction. This was per-
formed in samples from 149 CLL patients, including 18 patients
sampled at two time points, for which both exome sequencing
data and copy number data were available. This analysis allowed
us to study mutation frequencies, observe clonal evolution, and
link subclonal mutations to clinical outcome.
RESULTS
Large-Scale WES Analysis of CLL Expands the
Compendium of CLL Drivers and Pathways
We performed WES of 160 matched CLL and germline DNA
samples (including 82 of the 91 samples previously reported
[Wang et al., 2011]). This cohort included patients with both
low- and high-risk features based on established prognostic
risk factors (Table S1 available online). We applied MuTect (a
highly sensitive and speciﬁc mutation-calling algorithm; Cibul-
skis et al., 2013) to the WES data to detect somatic single nucle-
otide variations (sSNVs) present in as few as 10% of cancer cells.
Average sequencing depth of WES across samples was 1123
(see Extended Experimental Procedures). In total, we detected
2,444 nonsynonymous and 837 synonymous mutations in
protein-coding sequences, corresponding to a mean (±SD)
somatic mutation rate of 0.6 ± 0.28 per megabase (range,
0.03–2.3) and an average of 15.3 nonsynonymous mutations
per patient (range, 2–53) (Table S2A).
Expansion of our sample cohort provided us with the sensi-
tivity to detect 20 putative CLL cancer genes (q < 0.1), which
was accomplished through recurrence analysis to detect genes
enriched with mutations beyond the background mutation rate
(Figures 1A, top, and Figure S1) or genes with mutations that
overlap with previously reported mutated sites (from COSMIC
[Forbes et al., 2010]; Figure 1A, middle; Experimental Proce-
dures). These included eight of the nine genes identiﬁed in our
initial report (TP53, ATM, MYD88, SF3B1, NOTCH1, DDX3X,
ZMYM3, and FBXW7) (Wang et al., 2011). The missing gene,
MAPK1, did not harbor additional mutations in the increased
sample set, and therefore its overall mutation frequency now
fell below our signiﬁcance threshold. The 12 genes were mutated
at lower frequencies and, hence, were not detected in the previ-
ously reported subset of samples. Three of the twelve additional
candidate driver genes were identiﬁed in recent CLL sequencing
efforts (XPO1, CHD2, and POT1) (Fabbri et al., 2011; Puente
et al., 2011). The nine remaining genes represent candidate
CLL drivers, with mutations occurring at highly conserved sites
(Figure S2). These included six genes with known roles in cancer
biology (NRAS, KRAS [Bos, 1989], BCOR [Grossmann et al.,
2011], EGR2 [Unoki and Nakamura, 2003], MED12 [Ma¨ kinen
et al., 2011], and RIPK1 [Hosgood et al., 2009]), two genes that
affect immune pathways (SAMHD1 [Rice et al., 2009] and ITPKB
[Mare´ chal et al., 2011]), and a histone gene (HIST1H1E [Alami
et al., 2003]).
Together, the 20 candidate CLL driver genes appeared to fall
into seven core signaling pathways, in which the genes play
well-established roles. These include all ﬁve pathways that we
previously reported to play a role in CLL (DNA repair and cell-
cycle control, Notch signaling, inﬂammatory pathways, Wnt
signaling, RNA splicing, and processing). Two pathways were
implicated by our analysis: B cell receptor signaling and chro-
matin modiﬁcation (Figure 1B). We also noted that the CLL
samples contained additional mutations in the genes that form
these pathways, some of which are known drivers in other
malignancies.
Because recurrent chromosomal abnormalities have deﬁned
roles in CLL biology (Do¨ hner et al., 2000; Klein et al., 2010), we
further searched for loci that were signiﬁcantly ampliﬁed or
deleted by analyzing somatic copy-number alterations (sCNAs).
We applied GISTIC2.0 (Mermel et al., 2011) to 111 matched
tumor and normal samples, which were analyzed by SNP6.0
arrays (Brown et al., 2012). Through this analysis, we identiﬁed
deletions in chromosomes 8p, 13q, 11q, and 17p and trisomy
of chromosome 12 as signiﬁcantly recurrent events (Figure 1A,
bottom). Thus, based on WES and copy number analysis, we
altogether identiﬁed 20 mutated genes and ﬁve cytogenetic
alterations as putative CLL driver events.
Inference of Genetic Evolution with Whole-Exome
Sequencing Data
In order to study clonal evolution in CLL, we performed integra-
tive analysis of sCNAs and sSNVs using a recently reported algo-
rithm ABSOLUTE (Carter et al., 2012), which jointly estimated the
purity of the sample (fraction of cancer nuclei) and the average
ploidy of the cancer cells. All samples were estimated to have
near-diploid DNA content; these estimates were conﬁrmed by
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of seven
CLL samples (Figure S3A). Our data were sufﬁcient for resolution
of these quantities in 149 of the 160 samples (Table S2B), allow-
ing for discrimination of subclonal from clonal alterations,
including sCNAs, sSNVs, and selected indels (see Extended
Experimental Procedures). Our analysis approach is outlined in
Figure 2A. For each sSNV, we estimated its allelic fraction by

715

calculating the ratio of alternate to total number of reads
covering the mutation site in the WES data. These estimates
were consistent with independent deeper sequencing and RNA
sequencing (Figures S3B and S3C; Tables S3 and S4). Next,
we used ABSOLUTE to estimate the cancer cell fraction (CCF)
harboring the mutation by correcting for sample purity and local
copy-number at the sSNV sites (Experimental Procedures;
Table S2C; Figure 2B). We classiﬁed a mutation as clonal if the
CCF harboring it was >0.95 with probability >0.5 and subclonal
otherwise (Figure 2A, inset). The results remained unchanged
when more stringent cutoffs were used (Extended Experimental
Procedures). For sSNVs designated as subclonal, median CCF
was 0.49 with a range of 0.11–0.89.
Overall, we identiﬁed 1,543 clonal mutations (54% of all
detected mutations, average of 10.3 ± 5.5 mutations per sample;
Table S1). These mutations were likely acquired either before or
during the most recent complete selective sweep. This set there-
fore includes both neutral somatic mutations that preceded
transformation and the driver and passenger event(s) present
in each complete clonal sweep. A total of 1,266 subclonal sSNVs
were detected in 146 of 149 samples called by ABSOLUTE
(46%; average of 8.5 ± 5.8 subclonal mutations per sample).
These subclonal sSNVs exist in only a fraction of leukemic cells
and, hence, occurred after the emergence of the ‘‘most recent
common ancestor’’ and, by deﬁnition, also after disease initia-
tion. The mutational spectra were similar in clonal and subclonal
sSNVs (Figure S3D), consistent with a common set of mutational
processes, giving rise to both groups.
Age and Mutated IGHV Status Are Associated with
an Increased Number of Clonal Somatic Mutations
The identiﬁcation of subclones enabled us to analyze several
aspects of leukemia progression. We ﬁrst addressed how
clonal and subclonal mutations relate to the salient clinical

characteristics of CLL. CLL is generally a disease of the elderly
with established prognostic factors, such as the IGHV mutation
(Do¨ hner, 2005) and ZAP70 expression. Patients with a high
number of IGHV mutations (mutated IGHV) tend to have better
prognosis than those with a low number (unmutated IGHV)
(Do¨ hner, 2005). This marker distinguishes between leukemias
originating from B cells that have or have not yet, respectively,
undergone the process of somatic hypermutation that occurs
as part of normal B cell development. We examined the associ-
ation of these factors, as well as patient age at diagnosis, with
the prevalence of clonal and subclonal mutations. Age and
mutated IGHV status (but not ZAP70 expression) were found
to associate with greater numbers of clonal (but not subclonal)
mutations (age, p < 0.001; mutated versus unmutated IGHV,
p = 0.05; Figure 2C; Table S1). Because CLL samples with
mutated IGHV derive from B cells that have experienced a burst
of mutagenesis as part of normal B cell somatic hypermutation,
the increased number of clonal somatic mutations is likely
related to aberrant mutagenesis that preceded clonal transfor-
mation (Deutsch et al., 2007; McCarthy et al., 2003). Further-
more, the higher number of clonal sSNVs in older individuals is
consistent with the expectation that more neutral somatic muta-
tions accumulate over the patient’s lifetime prior to the onset of
cancer later in life (Stephens et al., 2012; Welch et al., 2012).
Subclonal Mutations Are Increased with Treatment
The effect of treatment on subclonal heterogeneity in CLL is
unknown. In samples from 29 patients treated with chemo-
therapy prior to sample collection, we observed a signiﬁcantly
higher number of subclonal (but not clonal) sSNVs per sample
than in the 120 patients who were chemotherapy-naive at the
time of sample (Figure 2D, top and middle). Using an analysis
of covariance model, we observed that receipt of treatment prior
to sample among the 149 patients was statistically signiﬁcant
(p = 0.048) but time from diagnosis to sample was not (p =
0.31). Because patients that do not require treatment in the
long-term may have a distinct subtype of CLL, we also restricted
the comparison of the 29 pretreated CLLs to only the 42 that

were eventually treated after sample collection and again
conﬁrmed this ﬁnding (p = 0.02). In these 42 patients, a higher
number of subclonal mutations was not correlated with a shorter
time to treatment (correlation coefﬁcient = 0.03; p = 0.87). Thus,
therapy prior to sample was associated with a higher number of
subclonal mutations, and furthermore, the number of subclonal
sSNVs detected increased with the number of prior therapies
(p = 0.011, Table S1).
Cancer therapy has been theorized to be an evolutionary
bottleneck, in which a massive reduction in malignant cell
numbers results in reduced genetic variation in the cell popula-
tion (Gerlinger and Swanton, 2010). It is likely that the overall
diversity in CLL is diminished after therapeutic bottlenecks as
well. Because most of the genetic heterogeneity within a cancer
is present at very low frequencies (Gerstung et al., 2012)—below
the level of detection afforded by the 1123 sequence coverage
we generated—we were unable to directly assess reduction in
overall genetic variation.
However, in the range of larger subclones that were observ-
able by our methods (>10% of malignant cells), we witnessed
increased diversity after therapy (Figure 2D). Although the avail-
able data cannot deﬁnitively rule out extensive diversiﬁcation
following therapy, this increase likely results, at least in part,
from outgrowth of pre-existing minor subclones (Schuh et al.,
2012; Wu, 2012). This may result from the removal of dominant
clones by cytotoxic treatment, eliminating competition for
growth and allowing the expansion of one or more ﬁt subclones
to frequencies above our detection threshold. Further supporting
our interpretation that ﬁtter clones grow more effectively and
become detectable after treatment, we observed an increased
frequency of subclonal driver events (which are presumably
ﬁtter) in treated relative to untreated patients (Figure 2D, bottom)
(note that driver events include CLL driver mutations [Figure 1A]
and sSNVs in highly conserved sites of genes in the Cancer Gene
Census [Futreal et al., 2004]).
Inferring the Order of Genetic Changes Underlying CLL
While general aspects of temporal evolution could not be
completely resolved in single time point WES samples, the order
of driver mutation acquisition could be partially inferred from the
aggregate frequencies at which they are found to be clonal or
subclonal. We considered the 149 samples as a series of ‘‘snap-
shots’’ taken along a temporal axis. Clonal status in all or most
mutations affecting a speciﬁc gene or chromosomal lesion
would suggest that this alteration was acquired at or prior to
the most recent selective sweep before sampling and hence
could be deﬁned as a stereotypically early event. Conversely,
predominantly subclonal status in a speciﬁc genetic alteration
implies a likely later event that is tolerated and selected for
only in the presence of an additional mutation.
This strategy was used to infer temporal ordering of the recur-
rent sSNVs and sCNAs (Figures 3A and S4). We focused on alter-
ations found in at least three samples within the cohort of 149
CLL samples. We found that three driver mutations—MYD88
(n = 12), trisomy 12 (n = 24), and hemizygous del(13q) (n =
70)—were clonal in 80%–100% of samples harboring these
alterations, a signiﬁcantly higher level than for other driver events
(q < 0.1, Fisher exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR [Benja-
mini and Hochberg, 1995]), implying that they arise earlier in
typical CLL development. Mutations in HIST1H1E, although

clonal in ﬁve of ﬁve affected samples, did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance. Other recurrent CLL drivers—for example, ATM,
TP53, and SF3B1 (9, 19, and 19 mutations in 6, 17, and 19
samples, respectively)—were more often subclonal, indicating
that they tend to arise later in leukemic development and
contribute to disease progression. We note that the above
approach assumed that different CLL samples evolve along a
common temporal progression axis. We therefore examined
speciﬁcally CLL samples that harbored one ‘‘early’’ driver muta-
tion and any additional driver alteration(s). As expected, the early
events had either similar or a higher CCF compared to ‘‘later’’
events (examples for trisomy 12 and MYD88 given in Figure 3B).
Direct Observation of Clonal Evolution by Longitudinal
Data Analysis of Chemotherapy-Treated CLL
To directly assess the evolution of somatic mutations in a subset
of patients, we compared CCF for each alteration across two
clinical time points in 18 of the 149 samples (median years
between time points was 3.5; range 3.1–4.5). Six patients
(‘‘untreated’’) did not receive treatment throughout the time of
study. The remaining 12 patients (‘‘treated’’) received intervening
chemotherapy
(primarily
ﬂudarabine
and/or
rituxan-based)
(Table S3). The two patient groups were not signiﬁcantly different
in terms of elapsed time between ﬁrst and second sample
(median 3.7 years for the six untreated patients compared to
3.5 years for the 12 treated patients, p = 0.62; exact Wilcoxon
rank-sum test), nor did it differ between time of diagnosis to ﬁrst
sample (p = 0.29).
Analysis of the 18 sets of data revealed that 11% of mutations
increased (34 sSNVs, 15 sCNAs), 2% decreased (six sSNVs, two
sCNAs), and 87% did not change their CCF over time (q < 0.1 for
signiﬁcant change in CCF, Table S5C). As suggested by our
single time point analysis, we observed a shift of subclonal driver
mutations (e.g., del(11q), SF3B1, and TP53) toward clonality
over time. Changes in the genetic composition of CLL cells
with clonal evolution were associated with network level
changes in gene expression related to emergence of speciﬁc
subclonal populations (e.g., changes in signatures associated
with SF3B1 or NRAS mutation [Figures S5D and S5E; Table
S6]). Finally, expanding sSNVs were enriched in genes included
in the Cancer Gene Census (Futreal et al., 2004) (p = 0.021) and in
CLL drivers (p = 0.028), consistent with the expected positive
selection for the subclones harboring them.
Clustering analysis of CCF distributions of individual genetic
events over the two time points (Extended Experimental Proce-
dures) revealed clear clonal evolution in 11 of 18 CLL sample
pairs. We observed clonal evolution in 10 of 12 sample pairs
that had undergone intervening treatment between time points
1 and 2 (Figures 4B and S5A–S5C). This was contrasted with
the six untreated CLLs, ﬁve of which demonstrated equilibrium
between subpopulations that was maintained over several years
(Figure 4A; p = 0.012, Fisher exact test). Of the 11 patients with
subclonal evolution across the sampling interval, ﬁve followed
a branched evolution pattern, as indicated by the disappearance
of mutations with high CCF co-occurring with the expansion of
other subclones (Figure 4B). This ﬁnding demonstrates that co-
existing sibling subclones are at least as common in CLL as
are linear nested subclones, as demonstrated in other hemato-
logical malignancies (Ding et al., 2012; Egan et al., 2012). We
conclude that chemotherapy-treated CLLs often undergo clonal
evolution, resulting in the expansion of previously minor sub-
clones. Thus, these longitudinal data validate the insights
obtained in the cross-sectional analysis, namely that (1) later
driver events expand over time (Figure 3A), and (2) treatment
results in the expansion of subclones enriched with drivers
(and thus presumably have higher ﬁtness) (Figure 2D).
Presence of Subclonal Drivers Adversely Impacts
Clinical Outcome
We observed treatment-associated clonal evolution to lead to
the replacement of the incumbent clone by a ﬁtter pre-existing
subclone (Figure 4B). Therefore, we would expect a shorter
time to relapse in individuals with evidence of clonal evolution
following treatment. As a measure of relapse, we assessed
failure-free survival from time of sample (‘‘FFS_Sample’’) and
failure-free survival from time of next therapy (‘‘FFS_Rx’’)
(Figure 5A), where failure is deﬁned as retreatment (a recognized
endpoint in slow growing lymphomas [Cheson et al., 2007]) or
death. For the study of clonal evolution in CLL, retreatment as
an endpoint is preferable to other measures, such as progression
alone, as this is a well-deﬁned event that reﬂects CLL disease
aggressiveness. For example, disease progression alone in
CLL may be asymptomatic without necessitating treatment;
conversely, treatment is administered only in the setting of
symptomatic disease or active disease relapse (Hallek et al.,
2008).
Within the 12 of 18 longitudinally analyzed samples that
received intervening treatment, we observed that the ten
samples with clonal evolution exhibited shortened FFS_Rx
(log-rank test; p = 0.015, Figure 5B). Importantly, the somatic
driver mutations that expanded to take over the entire population
upon relapse (‘‘time point-2’’) were often already detectable in
the pretreatment (‘‘time point-1’’) sample (Figures 4B and S5B).
Our results thus suggested that presence of detectable subclo-
nal drivers in pretreatment samples can anticipate clonal evolu-
tion in association with treatment. Indeed, the 8 of 12 samples
with presence of subclonal drivers in pretreatment samples
exhibited shorter FFS_Rx than the four samples with subclonal
drivers absent (p = 0.041, Figure 5C). Together, the results of
our longitudinally studied patient samples suggested that the
presence of driver events within subclones may impact prog-
nosis and clinical outcome.
We tested this hypothesis in the set of 149 patient samples, of
which subclonal driver mutations were detected in 46% (Fig-
ure 6A; Extended Experimental Procedures; Table S4). Indeed,
we found that CLL samples with subclonal driver mutations
were associated with a shorter time from sample collection to
treatment or death (FFS_Sample, p < 0.001, Figure 6B; Tables
S7A and S7C), which seemed to be independent of established
markers of poor prognosis (i.e., unmutated IGHV or presence of
del(11q) or del(17p), Figure S6). Moreover, we tested speciﬁcally
whether the presence of pretreatment subclonal drivers was
associated with a shorter FFS_Rx, as we observed in the longi-
tudinal data. Therefore, we focused on the 67 patients who
were treated after sample collection (median time to ﬁrst therapy
from time of sample was 11 months [range 1–45]). These patients

could be divided into two groups based on the presence (n = 39)
or absence (n = 29) of a subclonal driver (62% and 64%, respec-
tively, were treated with ﬂudarabine-based immunochemother-
apy, p = 0.4). The 39 of these patients in which subclonal CLL
drivers were detected required earlier retreatment or died
(shorter FFS_Rx; log-rank test, p = 0.006, Figure 6C; Table
S7A), indicative of a more rapid disease course.
Regression models adjusting for multiple CLL prognostic
factors (IGHV status, prior therapy, and high-risk cytogenetics)
supported the presence of a subclonal driver as an independent
risk factor for earlier retreatment (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] of
3.61 [CI 1.42–9.18], Cox p = 0.007; unadjusted HR, 3.20 [CI
1.35–7.60], Figure 6D), comparable to the strongest known
CLL risk factors. In similar modeling within a subset of 62
patients who had at least one driver (clonal or subclonal), the
association of the presence of a subclonal driver with a shorter
time to retreatment or death was also signiﬁcant (p = 0.012,
Table S7B), reﬂecting that this difference is not merely attribut-
able to the presence of a driver. Additionally, an increased
number of subclonal driver mutations per sample (but not clonal
drivers) was also associated with a stronger HR for shorter
FFS_Rx (Table S7D). Finally, this association retained signiﬁ-
cance (Cox p = 0.033, Table S7E) after adjusting for the presence
of mutations previously associated with poor prognosis (ATM,
Figure 4. Longitudinal Analysis of Subclonal Evolution in CLL and Its Relation to Therapy
(A and B) Joint distributions of cancer cell fraction (CCF) values across two time points were estimated using clustering analysis (see Extended Experimental
Procedures). Red: a mutation with an increase in CCF of greater than 0.2 (with probability >0.5). The dotted diagonal line represents y = x or where identical CCF
values across the two time points fall; the dotted parallel lines denote the 0.2 CCF interval on either side. Likely driver mutations were labeled. Six CLLs with no
intervening treatment (A) and 12 CLLs with intervening treatment (B) were classiﬁed according to clonal evolution status, based on the presence of mutations with
an increase of CCF > 0.2.

TP53, and SF3B1), suggesting that, in addition to the driver’s
identity, its subclonal status also affects clinical outcome.
DISCUSSION
While intertumoral (Quesada et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011) and
intratumoral (Schuh et al., 2012; Stilgenbauer et al., 2007)
genetic heterogeneity had been previously demonstrated in
CLL, our use of WES-based algorithms enabled a more compre-
hensive study of clonal evolution and its clinical impact. We
propose the existence of distinct periods in CLL progression.
In the ﬁrst period prior to transformation, passenger events
accumulate in the cell that will eventually be the founder of the
leukemia (in proportion to the age of the patient, Figure 2C),
and are thus clonal mutations (Figure 7A). In the second period,
the founding CLL mutation appears in a single cell and leads to
transformation (Figure 7B); these are also clonal mutations, but
unlike passenger mutations, these are recurrent across patients.
We identiﬁed driver mutations that were consistently clonal
(del(13q), MYD88, and trisomy 12 (Figure 3A), which appear to
be relatively speciﬁc drivers of CLL or B cell malignancies (Ber-
oukhim et al., 2010; Do¨ hner et al., 2000; Ngo et al., 2010). In
the third period of disease progression, subclonal mutations
expand over time as a function of their ﬁtness-integrating
intrinsic factors (e.g., proliferation and apoptosis) and extrinsic
pressures (e.g., interclonal competition and therapy) (Figures
7C and 7D). The subclonal drivers include ubiquitous cancer
genes, such as ATM, TP53, or RAS mutations (Figure 3A). These
data suggest that mutations that selectively affect B cells may
contribute more to the initiation of disease and precede selection
of more generic cancer drivers that underlie disease progres-
sion—providing predictions that can be tested in human B cells
or animal models of CLL.
An important question addressed here is how treatment
affects clonal evolution in CLL. In the 18 patients monitored at
two time points, we observed two general patterns—clonal
equilibrium, in which the relative sizes of each subclone were
maintained, and clonal evolution, in which some subclones
emerge as dominant (Figure 4). We propose that, in untreated
samples, more time is needed for a new ﬁt clone to take over
the population in the presence of existing dominant clones (Fig-
ure 7D, top). In contrast, in treated samples, cytotoxic therapy
typically removes the incumbent clones (Jablonski, 2001)—
acting like a ‘‘mass extinction’’ event (Jablonski, 2001)—and
shifts the evolutionary landscape (Nowak and Sigmund, 2004;
Vincent and Gatenby, 2008) in favor of one or more aggressive
subclones (Maley et al., 2006; Figure 7D, bottom). Thus, highly
ﬁt subclones likely beneﬁt from treatment and exhibit rapid
outgrowth (Greaves and Maley, 2012).
CLL is an incurable disease with a prolonged course of remis-
sions and relapses. It has been long recognized that relapsed
disease responds increasingly less well to therapy over time.
We now show an association between increased clinical aggres-
siveness and genetic evolution, which has therapeutic implica-
tions. We found that the presence of pretreatment subclonal
driver mutations anticipated the dominant genetic composition
of the relapsing tumor. Such information may eventually guide
the selection of therapies to prevent the expansion of highly ﬁt
subclones. In addition, the potential hastening of the evolu-
tionary process with treatment provides a mechanistic justiﬁca-
tion for the empirical practice of ‘‘watch and wait’’ as the CLL
treatment paradigm (CLL Trialists Collaborative Group, 1999).
The detection of driver mutations in subclones (a testimony to
an active evolutionary process) may thus provide a prognostic
approach in CLL, which can now be rigorously tested in larger
clinical trials.
In conclusion, we demonstrate the ability to study tumor
heterogeneity and clonal evolution with standard WES. These
innovations will allow characterization of the subclonal mutation
spectrum in large, publicly available data sets (Masica and
Karchin, 2011). The implementation described here may also
be readily adopted for clinical applications. Even more impor-
tantly, our studies underscore the importance of evolutionary
development as the engine driving cancer relapse. This knowl-
edge challenges us to develop therapeutic paradigms that not
only target speciﬁc drivers (i.e., ‘‘targeted therapy’’) but also
the evolutionary landscape (Nowak and Sigmund, 2004) of these
drivers.

(A) Schema of the main clinical outcome measures that were analyzed: failure-
free survival from time of sample (FFS_Sample) and from initiation of ﬁrst
treatment after sampling (FFS_Rx). Within the longitudinally followed CLLs that
received intervening treatment (12 of 18), shorter FFS_Rx was observed in CLL
samples that (B) had evidence of genetic evolution (n = 10) compared to
samples with absent or minimal evolution (n = 2; Fisher exact test) and that (C)
harbored a detectable subclonal driver in the pretreatment sample (n = 8)
compared to samples with absent subclonal driver (n = 4).

samples, which were treated after sampling.
(D) A Cox multivariable regression model designed to test for prognostic factors contributing to shorter FFS_Rx showed that presence of a subclonal driver was
an independent predictor of outcome.

material was obtained from patients enrolled in clinical research protocols at
the Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center (DFHCC), approved by the DFHCC
Human Subjects Protection Committee. Tumor and normal DNA from 11 addi-
tional patients were also analyzed by DNA sequencing alone (a total of 160 CLL
samples). Eighty-two CLL samples were previously reported (Wang et al.,
2011), and the raw BAM ﬁles for these samples were reprocessed and reana-
lyzed together with the new data to ensure the consistency of the results and to
enable the detection of smaller subclones made possible with a newer version
of the mutation caller. Written informed consent was obtained prior to sample
collection according to the Declaration of Helsinki. DNA was extracted from
blood- or marrow-derived lymphocytes (tumor) and autologous epithelial cells
(saliva), ﬁbroblasts, or granulocytes (normal).
Libraries for WES were constructed and sequenced on either an Illumina
HiSeq 2000 or GA-IIX using 76 bp paired-end reads (Berger et al., 2011;
Chapman et al., 2011). Output from Illumina software was processed by the
Picard data processing pipeline to yield BAM ﬁles containing well-calibrated,
aligned reads (Chapman et al., 2011; DePristo et al., 2011). sSNVs and indels
were identiﬁed using MuTect (V119, [Cibulskis et al., 2013]) and indelocator
(V61, [Wang et al., 2011]), respectively. Recurrent sSNV and indels in 160
CLLs were identiﬁed using MutSig2.0 (Lohr et al., 2012). For 111 of 149
matched CLL-normal DNA samples, copy number proﬁles were obtained
using the Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Array 6.0, with allele-speciﬁc
analysis (HAPSEG [Carter et al., 2011]). Recurrent sCNAs were identiﬁed using
the GISTIC2.0 algorithm (Mermel et al., 2011), after excluding germline copy
Figure 7. A Model for the Stepwise Transformation of CLL
(A–D) Our data suggest distinct periods in the history of CLL. We observed an increase in clonal mutations in older patients and in the IGHV mutated subtype, likely
corresponding to pretransformation mutagenesis (A). We identiﬁed earlier and later mutations in CLL, consistent with B cell-speciﬁc (B) and ubiquitous cancer
events (C and D), respectively. Finally, clonal evolution and treatment show a complex relationship. Most untreated CLLs and a minority of treated CLLs maintain
stable clonal equilibrium over years (C). However, in the presence of a subclone containing a strong driver, treatment may disrupt interclonal equilibrium and
hasten clonal evolution (D).

number variants. For CLL samples with no available SNP arrays (38 of
149 CLLs), sCNAs were estimated directly from the WES data based on the
ratio of CLL sample read-depth to the average read-depth observed in
normal samples for that region. We applied ABSOLUTE to estimate sample
purity, ploidy, and absolute somatic copy numbers. These were used to infer
the CCFs of point mutations from the WES data. Following the framework
previously described (Carter et al., 2012), we computed the posterior
probability distribution over CCF c as follows. Consider a somatic mutation
observed in a of N sequencing reads on a locus of absolute somatic
copy number q in a sample of purity a. The expected allele-fraction f of a muta-
tion present in one copy in a fraction c of cancer cells is calculated by
fðcÞ = ac=ð2ð1  aÞ + aqÞ,
with
c˛½0:01; 1.
Then,
PðcÞfBinomðajN; fðcÞÞ,
assuming a uniform prior on c. The distribution over CCF was then obtained
by calculating these values over a regular grid of 100 c values and normalizing
by dividing them by their sum, which is the constant of proportionality in
the above equation. Mutations were thereafter classiﬁed as clonal based
on the posterior probability that the CCF exceeded 0.95 and subclonal other-
wise. Validation of allelic fraction was performed by using deep sequencing
with indexed libraries recovered on a Fluidigm chip. Resulting normalized
libraries were loaded on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina) and sequenced
using paired-end 150 bp sequencing reads to an average coverage depth of
4,2003.
Associations between mutation rates and clinical features were assessed by
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fisher exact test, or the Kruskal–Wallis test, as
appropriate. Time to event data were estimated by the method of Kaplan
and Meier, and differences between groups were assessed using the log-
rank test. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox modeling was performed to assess
the impact of the presence of a subclonal driver on clinical outcome measures
alone and in the presence of clinical features known to impact outcome. A chi-
square test with 1 degree of freedom and the 2 Log-likelihood statistic were
used to test the prognostic independence of subclonal status in Cox modeling.

Extended Experimental Procedures.

Supplemental Information
EXTENDED EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Human Samples
Heparinized blood, skin biopsies and saliva were obtained from patients enrolled on clinical research protocols at the Dana-Farber
Harvard Cancer Center (DFHCC) approved by the DFHCC Human Subjects Protection Committee. The diagnosis of CLL according
to WHO criteria was conﬁrmed in all cases by ﬂow cytometry, or by lymph node or bone marrow biopsy. Peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells (PBMC) from normal donors and patients were isolated by Ficoll/Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. Mononuclear
cells were used fresh or cryopreserved with FBS 10% DMSO and stored in vapor-phase liquid nitrogen until the time of analysis.
Primary skin ﬁbroblast lines were generated from skin punch biopsies as previously described(Wang et al., 2011). The patients
included in the cohort represent the broad clinical spectrum of CLL (Table S1).
Established CLL Prognostic Factor Analysis
Immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) homology (unmutated was deﬁned as greater than or equal to 98% homology to the
closest germline match) and ZAP-70 expression (high risk deﬁned as > 20% positive) were determined (Rassenti et al., 2008). Cytoge-
netics were evaluated by FISH for the most common CLL abnormalities (del(13q), trisomy 12, del(11q), del(17p), rearrangements of
chromosome 14) (all probes from Vysis, Des Plaines, IL, performed at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Cytogenetics Laboratory,
BostonMA). Sampleswerescoredpositive forachromosomalaberrationbasedonconsensuscytogeneticscoring(Smoleyetal.,2010).
DNA Quality Control
We used standard Broad Institute protocols as recently described (Berger et al., 2011; Chapman et al., 2011). Tumor and normal DNA
concentration were measured using PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A minimum DNA concen-
tration of 60 ng/ml was required for sequencing. In select cases where concentration was < 60 ng/ml, ethanol precipitation and
re-suspension was performed. Gel electrophoresis conﬁrmed that the large majority of DNA was high molecular weight. All Illumina
sequencing libraries were created with the native DNA. The identities of all tumor and normal DNA samples (native and WGA product)
were conﬁrmed by mass spectrometric ﬁngerprint genotyping of 24 common SNPs (Sequenom, San Diego, CA).
Whole-Exome DNA Sequencing
Informed consent on DFCI IRB-approved protocols for whole-exome sequencing of patients’ samples was obtained prior to the
initiation of sequencing studies. DNA was extracted from blood or marrow-derived lymphocytes (tumor) and saliva, ﬁbroblasts or
granulocytes (normal), as previously described (Wang et al., 2011). Libraries for WES were constructed and sequenced on either
an Illumina HiSeq 2000 or Illumina GA-IIX using 76 bp paired-end reads. Details of whole-exome library construction have been
detailed elsewhere (Fisher et al., 2011). Standard quality control metrics, including error rates, percentage passing ﬁlter reads,
and total Gb produced, were used to characterize process performance before downstream analysis. Average exome coverage
depth was 1123/1073 for tumor/germline. The Illumina pipeline generates data ﬁles (BAM ﬁles) that contain the reads together
with quality parameters. Of the 160 CLL samples reported in the current manuscript, 82 were included in a previous study (Wang
et al., 2011). 340 CLL and germline samples were sequenced overall. These include 160 CLL and matched germline DNA samples
as well as time point 2 samples for 17 of 160 CLLs, and an additional sample pair and germline for a longitudinal sample pair not
included in the 160 cohort (CLL020).
Identiﬁcation of Somatic Mutations
Output from Illumina software was processed by the ‘‘Picard’’ data processing pipeline to yield BAM ﬁles containing aligned reads
(via MAQ, to the NCBI Human Reference Genome Build hg18) with well-calibrated quality scores (Chapman et al., 2011; DePristo
et al., 2011). For 51 of the 160 CLL samples included in the analysis, sequencing was performed on capture libraries generated
from whole-genome-ampliﬁed (WGA) samples. For those samples, 100 ng inputs of samples were whole-genome ampliﬁed with
the QIAGEN REPLI-g Midi Kit (Valencia, CA).
From the sequencing data, somatic alterations were identiﬁed using a set of tools within the ‘‘Firehose’’ pipeline, developed at the
Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga). The details of our sequencing data processing have been described else-
where (Berger et al., 2011; Chapman et al., 2011). Somatic single nucleotide variations (sSNVs) were detected using MuTect [V119,
http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/mutect, (Cibulskis et al., 2013)]; somatic small insertions and deletions (indels) were de-
tected using Indelocator [v61, http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/indelocator, (Wang et al., 2011)]. All mutations identiﬁed
in longitudinal samples were conﬁrmed by manual inspection of the sequencing data (Robinson et al., 2011). An estimated contam-
ination threshold of 5% was used for all samples based on the highest contamination values seen in a formal contamination analysis
done with ContEst based on matched SNP arrays (Cibulskis et al., 2011). Ig loci mutations were not included in this analysis. All
somatic mutations detected in the 160 CLL samples are listed in Table S2A. WES data is deposited in dbGaP (phs000435.v1.p1).
Signiﬁcance Analysis for Recurrently Mutated Genes
The prioritization of somatic mutations in terms of conferring selective advantage was done with the statistical method
MutSig2.0 (Lohr et al., 2012). In short, the algorithm takes an aggregated list of mutations and tries to detect genes that are affected
Cell 152, 714–726, February 14, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc.
S1

more than expected by chance, as those likely reﬂect positive selection (i.e driver events). There are two main components to
MutSig2.0:
The ﬁrst component attempts to model the background mutation rate for each gene, while taking into account various different
factors. Namely, it takes into account the fact that the background mutation rate may vary depending on the base context and
base change of the mutation, as well as the fact that the background rate of a gene can also vary across different patients. Given
these factors and the background model, it uses convolutions of binomial distributions to calculate a P value, which represents
the probability that we obtain the observed conﬁguration of mutations, or a more signiﬁcant one.
The second component of the algorithm focuses on the positional conﬁguration of mutations and their sequence conservation
(Lohr et al., 2012). For each gene, the algorithm permutes the mutations preserving their tri-nucleotide context, and for each permu-
tation calculates two metrics: one that measures the degree of clustering into hotspots along the coding length of the gene, and one
that measures the average conservation of mutations in the gene. These two null models are then combined into a joint distribution,
which is used to calculate a P value that reﬂects the probability by chance that we can obtain by chance the observed mutational
degree of clustering and conservation, or a more signiﬁcant outcome.
The two P values that are produced by the two components are then combined using Fisher-Combine (Fisher, 1932) which yields
a ﬁnal P value which is used to sort the genes by degree of mutational signiﬁcance. This is subsequently corrected for multi-hypoth-
esis using the Benjamini Hochberg procedure.
Genome-wide Copy Number Analysis
Genome-wide copy number proﬁles of 111 CLL samples and their patient-matched germline DNA were obtained using the Genome-
wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix), according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Genetic Analysis Platform, Broad Institute,
Cambridge MA). SNP array data were deposited in dbGaP (phs000435.v1.p1). Allele-speciﬁc analysis also allowed for the identiﬁ-
cation of copy neutral LOH events as well as quantiﬁcation of the homologous copy-ratios (HSCSs) [HAPSEG(Carter et al.,
2011)]. Signiﬁcant recurrent chromosomal abnormalities were identiﬁed using the GISTIC2.0 algorithm ((Mermel et al., 2011),v87).
Regions with germline copy number variants were excluded from the analysis.
For CLL samples with no available SNP arrays (38/160), sCNAs were estimated directly from the WES data, based on the ratio of
CLL sample read-depth to the average read-depth observed in normal samples for that region. 11/160 samples were excluded from
this analysis due to inability to obtain copy number information from the WES data. See Figure 2A for outline of sample processing.
Validation Deep Sequencing
Validation targeted resequencing of 252 selected somatic mutations sSNVs was performed using microﬂuidic PCR. Target speciﬁc
primers with Fluidigm-compatible tails were designed to ﬂank sites of interest and produce amplicons of 200 +/20bp. Molecular
barcoded, Illumina-compatible oligonucleotides, containing sequences complementary to the primer tails were added to the
Fluidigm Access Array chip (San Francisco, CA) in the same well as the genomic DNA samples (20 - 50 ng of input) such that all
amplicons for a given genomic sample shared the same index, and PCR was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommen-
dations. Indexed libraries were recovered for each sample in a single collection well on the Fluidigm chip, quantiﬁed using picogreen
and then normalized for uniformity across libraries. Resulting normalized libraries were loaded on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina)
and sequenced using paired end 150bp sequencing reads. 95.2% of called sSNVs were detected in the validation experiment
(Table S5A). For 91.8% of the mutations, the allelic fraction estimates were concordant (with the discordant events enriched in sites
of lower WES coverage).
RNA Sequencing and dUTP Library Construction
5 mg of total RNA was poly-A selected using oligo-dT beads to extract the desired mRNA. The puriﬁed mRNA is treated with DNase,
and cleaned up using SPRI (Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization) beads according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Selected Poly-A
RNA was then fragmented into 450 bp fragments in an acetate buffer at high heat. Fragmented RNA was cleaned with SPRI and
primed with random hexamers before ﬁrst strand cDNA synthesis. The ﬁrst strand was reverse transcribed off the RNA template in
the presence of Actinomycin D to prevent hairpinning and puriﬁed using SPRI beads. The RNA in the RNA-DNA complex was then
digested using RNase H. The second strand was next synthesized with a dNTP mixture in which dTTPs had been replaced with
dUTPs. After another SPRI bead puriﬁcation, the resultant cDNA was processed using Illumina library construction according to
manufacturers protocol (end repair, phosphorylation, adenylation, and adaptor ligation with indexed adaptors). SPRI-based size
selection was performed to remove adaptor dimers present in the newly constructed cDNA library. Libraries were then treated
with Uracil-Speciﬁc Excision Reagent (USER) to nick the second strand at every incorporated Uracil (dUTP). Subsequently, libraries
were enriched with 8 cycles of PCR using the entire volume of sample as template. After enrichment, the library is quantiﬁed using
pico green, and the fragment size is measured using the Agilent Bioanalyzer according to manufactures protocol. Samples were
pooled and sequenced using either 76 or 101bp paired end reads.
RNASeq Data Analysis
RNaseq BAMs were aligned to the hg18 genome using the TopHat suite. Each somatic base substitution detected by WES was
compared to reads at the same location in RNaseq. Based on the number of alternate and reference reads, a power calculation
S2
Cell 152, 714–726, February 14, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc.

was obtained with beta-binomial distribution (power threshold used was greater than 80%). Mutation calls were deemed validated if
2 or greater alternate allele reads were observed in RNA-Seq at the site, as long as RNaseq was powered to detect an event at the
speciﬁed location.
FACS Validation of Ploidy Estimates with ABSOLUTE
Consistent with published studies of CLL (Brown et al., 2012; Edelmann et al., 2012), ABSOLUTE measured all CLL samples to be
near diploid (Table S2B; median - 2, range 1.95-2.1). We conﬁrmed the measurements using a standard assay for measuring DNA
content. For this analysis, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal volunteers and CLL patients and cell lines are ﬁrst stained
with anti-CD5 FITC and anti-CD19 PE antibodies in a PBS buffer containing 1% BSA for 30 min on ice. After extensive washes, the
cells were then stained with a PBS buffer contained 1% BSA, 0.03% saponin (Sigma) and 250ug/ml 7-AAD (Invitrogen) for 1 hr on ice,
followed by analysis on a Beckman Coulter FC500 machine (Figure S3A).
Estimation of Mutation Cancer Cell Fraction Using ABSOLUTE
We used the ABSOLUTE algorithm to calculate the purity, ploidy, and absolute DNA copy-numbers of each sample (Carter et al.,
2012). Modiﬁcations were made to the algorithm, which are implemented in version 1.05 of the software, available for download
at http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/absolute. Speciﬁcally, we added the ability to determine sample purity from sSNVs
alone, in samples where no sCNAs are present (the ploidy of such samples is 2N). In addition, estimates of sample purity and absolute
copy-numbers are used to compute distributions over cancer cell fraction (CCF) values of each sSNV, as described (Experimental
Procedures), and for sCNAs (described below).
The current implementation of ABSOLUTE does not automatically correct for sCNA subclonality when computing CCF distribu-
tions of sSNVs (this is an area of ongoing development). Fortunately, the few sCNAs that occurred in our CLL samples were predom-
inantly clonal. Manual corrections were made for CLL driver sSNVs occurring at site of subclonal sCNAs (5 TP53 sSNVs and 1 ATM
sSNV), based on the sample purity, allelic fraction and the copy ratio of the matching sCNA.
Each sSNV was classiﬁed as clonal or subclonal based on the probability that the CCF exceeded 0.95. A probability threshold of
0.5 was used throughout the manuscript. However, as the histogram in Figure 2A shows, the distribution of events around the
threshold was observed to be fairly uniform and results were not signiﬁcantly affected across a range of thresholds. For example,
the results of our analyses were unchanged when we altered our deﬁnition of clonal mutations to be (Pr(CCF > 0.95)) > 0.75, and
subclonal when Pr(CCF > 0.95) was < 0.25, leaving uncertain mutations unclassiﬁed. Using these thresholds, CLLs with mutated
IGHV and age were associated with a higher number of clonal mutations (P values of 0.05 and < 0.0001, respectively). CLLs treated
prior to sample collection had a higher number of subclonal mutations (p = 0.01) and the subclonal set was enriched with putative
drivers (p = 0.0019). Importantly, the results of the clinical analysis also remained unchanged. FFS_Rx was shorter in samples in
which a subclonal driver was detected (p = 0.007) and regression models examining known poor prognostic indicators in CLL yielded
an adjusted P value of 0.009.
One of the recurrent CLL cancer genes, NOTCH1, had 15 mutations, 14 of which were the identical canonical 2 base-pair deletions.
Unlike sSNVs, the observed allelic fractions of indel events were not modeled as binomial sampling of reference and alternate
sequence reads according to their true concentration in the sample(Carter et al., 2012). This was due to biases affecting the alignment
of the short sequencing reads, which generally favor reference over alternate alleles. To measure the magnitude of this effect, we
examined the allelic fraction (AF) of 514 germline 2bp deletions called in 4 normal germline WES samples. We observed that the distri-
bution (data not shown) of allelic-fractions for heterozygous events was peaked at 0.41, as opposed to the expected mode of 0.5,
with nearly all AFs between 0.3 to 0.6. Therefore, the bias factor toward reference is peaked at 0.82 but may range from 0.6 to 1
(unlikely to be greater than 1). CCF distributions for the 14 somatic indels in NOTCH1 were calculated using bias factors of 1.0
(no bias), 0.82 (bias point-estimate), and 0.6 (worst case observed). Reassuringly, the classiﬁcation of NOTCH1 indels as clonal or
subclonal was highly robust and was essentially the same using the three values–only a single case (CLL155) was ambiguous and
was classiﬁed as subclonal using 1.0 and 0.82, and clonal using 0.6. Taking a conservative approach, not classifying a mutation
as sub-clonal unless there is clear evidence for it, we decided to call this event as clonal for downstream analysis.
Estimation of CCF values for subclonal sCNAs is implemented (ABSOLUTEv1.05) in a manner analogous to the procedure for
sSNVs (Experimental Procedures), although the transformation is more complex, due to the need for assumptions of the subclonal
structure and the error model of microarray based copy-number data. Segmental sCNAs are deﬁned as subclonal based on the
mixture model used in ABSOLUTE (Carter et al., 2012). Let the functions hðxÞ and h0ðxÞ denote a variance stabilizing transformation
and its derivative, respectively. For SNP microarray data, these are deﬁned as: hðxÞ = sinh1ðbxÞ, where b = ðes2
h  1Þ
1
2=se, and
h
0ðxÞ = b=ð1 + ðbxÞ2Þ
1
2 (Huber et al., 2002). The values se and sh denote additive and multiplicative noise scales, respectively, for
the microarray hybridization being analyzed; these are estimated by HAPSEG (Carter et al., 2011). The calibrated probe-level micro-
array data become approximately normal under this transformation, which is used by HAPSEG to estimate the segmental allelic
copy-ratios ri and the posterior standard deviation of their mean (under the transformation), si (Carter et al., 2011). An additional
parameter sH is estimated by ABSOLUTE(Carter et al., 2012), which represents additional sample-level variance corresponding to
regional biases not captured in the probe-level model.
For a subclonal segment i, let qc denote the absolute copy number in the unaffected cells, and qs denote the absolute copy number
in the altered cells. Both of these values are unknown but we used a simplifying assumption that the difference between qc and qs is
Cell 152, 714–726, February 14, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc.
S3

one copy with qc being closer to the modal copy-number. Therefore, for subclonal deletions (copy ratios below the ratio of modal
copy number), qs was set to the nearest copy number below the measured value, and qc = qs+1. For subclonal gains (ratios above
the modal number), qs was set to the nearest copy number above the measured value, and qc = qs-1. Because the CLL genomes
analyzed here were universally near diploid, this was nearly equivalent to assuming that subclonal deletions had qs = 0 in the affected
cells and gains qs = 2, with qc = 1 in both cases (in allelic units). However, we note that these assumptions would not be strictly correct
in genomes after doubling, or in cases of high-level ampliﬁcation. In these cases, calculation of posterior CCF distributions will require
integration over qs and qc, averaging over the set of plausible subclonal genomic conﬁgurations.
Let rc and rs be the theoretical copy ratio values corresponding to qc and qs (accounting for sample purity, ploidy, and the modeled
attenuation rate of the microarray (Carter et al., 2011; Carter et al., 2012)). Let d = rs  rc, then, for CCF c, let rxðcÞ = dc + rc. Then
PðcÞfN ðhðrxðcÞÞjhðriÞ; ðsi + sHÞ2Þjh0ðrxðcÞÞj. The absolute value of the derivative is required due to the change of coordinates from
x to h(x). The distribution over CCF is obtained by calculating these values over a regular grid of 100 c values and normalizing. We
note that, when copy numbers are estimated directly from sequencing data, the calculation is simpler, as there is no attenuation
effect and hðxÞ = x. These calculations were used to generate the 95% conﬁdence intervals on the CCF of subclonal driver sCNAs
shown in Figure 4 and Figures S5A and S5B.
Cancer Gene Census List and Conservation Annotations
Conservation of a speciﬁc mutated site was adapted from UCSC conservation score track. A scale of 0-100 was linearly converted
from the 6 to 6 scale used in the phastCons track(Siepel et al., 2005). To conﬁrm that driver mutations are more likely to occur in
conserved sites, we quantiﬁed the conservation in the COSMIC database (Forbes et al., 2010) hotspots and compared it to non-
COSMIC hotspots coding location. We matched conservation information for 5085 sites that had greater than 3 exact hits reported
in mutations deposited in the COSMIC database, and compared it to conservation found for a set of non-overlapping 5085 randomly
sampled coding sites. The conservation was higher in the COSMIC sites than in the non-COSMIC coding sites set (mean conserva-
tion 82.39 and 62.15, respectively, p < 1e-50). We noted that the distribution of events was not uniform, and nearly one half of
COSMIC hotspots had a conservation measure greater than 95 (49.65%, compared to 15.5% in the non-COSMIC set, p < 1e-
50). For our calculations, we used a cut off of > 95 to designate conserved sites likely to contain higher proportion of cancer drivers.
We complemented the analysis for putative driver event enrichment by matching the altered genes to the Cancer Gene Census
(Futreal et al., 2004).
Clustering Analysis of sSNVs in 18 CLL Sample Pairs
In order to better resolve the true cancer cell fraction (CCF) of sSNVs detected in longitudinal samples, we employed a previously
described Bayesian clustering procedure (Escobar and West, 1995). This approach exploits the assumption that the observed
subclonal sSNV CCF values were sampled from a smaller number of subclonal cell populations (subclones). All remaining uncertainty
(including the exact number of clusters) was integrated out using a mixture of Dirichlet processes, which was ﬁt using a Gibbs
sampling approach, building on a previously described framework (Escobar and West, 1995).
The inputs to this procedure are the posterior CCF distributions for each sSNV being considered. We note that the CCF distribu-
tions for sCNAs could be added into the model, however we did not attempt this in the present study. CCF distributions are repre-
sented as 100-bin histograms over the unit interval; the two-dimensional CCF distributions used for the 2D clustering of longitudinal
samples were obtained as the outer product of the matched histogram pairs for each mutation, resulting in 10,000-bin histograms
(Figure S5). We note that the use of histograms to represent posterior distributions on CCF, although computationally less efﬁcient
than parametric forms, has the advantage that CCFs of different mutation classes may be easily combined in the model, even though
their posteriors may have very different forms. We also note that the algorithm implementation is identical for the single sample and
paired (longitudinal) sample cases, although only the latter was used in the present study.
At each iteration of the Gibbs sampler, each mutation is assigned to a unique cluster and the posterior CCF distribution of each
cluster is computed using Bayes’ rule, as opposed to drawing a sample from the posterior (a uniform prior on CCF from 0.01 to 1
is used). When considering the probability of a mutation to join an existing cluster, the likelihood calculation of the mutation arising
from the cluster is integrated over the uncertainty in the cluster CCF. This allows for rapid convergence of the Gibbs sampler to its
stationary distribution, which was typically obtained in fewer than 100 iterations for the analysis presented in this study. We ran the
Gibbs sampler for 1,000 iterations, of which the ﬁrst 500 were discarded before summarization.
Because of the small number of clonal mutations in some WES samples, we make an additional modiﬁcation to the standard
Dirichlet process model by adding a ﬁxed clonal cluster that persists even if no mutation is assigned to it. This reﬂects our prior
knowledge that clonal mutations must exist, even if they are the minority of detected mutations. For the samples analyzed here,
this modiﬁcation had very little effect.
A key aspect of implementing the Dirichlet process model on WES data sets is re-parameterization of prior distributions on the
number of subclones k as priors on the concentration parameter a of the Dirichlet process model. Importantly, this must take into
account the number of mutations N input to the model, as the effect of a on k is strongly dependent on N (Escobar and West,
1995). We accomplish this by constructing a map from a regular grid over a to expected values of k, given N, using the fact that:
Pðkja; NÞ = cNðkÞN!akðGðaÞ=Gða + NÞÞ (Escobar and West, 1995), where the cNðkÞ factors correspond to the unsigned Stirling
numbers of the ﬁrst kind. With this map in hand, we perform an optimization procedure to ﬁnd parameters a and b of a prior Gamma

distribution over a resulting in the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence with the speciﬁed prior over k (the divergence was computed
numerically on the histograms). Once the prior over a has been represented as a Gamma distribution, learning about a (and there-
fore k) from the data can be directly incorporated into the Gibbs sampling procedure, resulting in a continuous mixture of Dirichlet
processes (Escobar and West, 1995). This allows consistent parameterization of prior knowledge (or lack thereof) on the number
of subclonal populations in the face of vastly different numbers of input mutations, which is necessary for making consistent infer-
ences across differing data sets (e.g., WES versus WGS). We note that taking uncertainty about a into account is necessary for infer-
ences on the number of subclonal populations to be strictly valid, as implementations with ﬁxed values of a result in an implicit prior
over k that depends upon N (this is especially important for smaller values of N). For the application presented in this study (Figure 4),
we speciﬁed a weak prior on k using a negative binomial distribution with r = 10, m = 2 (these values favored 1-10 clusters). We note
that these are the only two user-speciﬁed parameters of the clustering analysis.
Upon termination of the Gibbs sampler, we summarized the posterior probability over the CCF of each sSNV by averaging the
posterior cluster distribution for all clusters to which the sSNV was assigned during sampling. This allowed shrinkage of the CCF
probability distributions (as shown in Figure 4; pre-clustering results are shown in Figure S5A and S5B), without having to choose
an exact number of subclonal clusters. Note that the 18 longitudinal sample pairs contain 1 CLL sample pair not initially included
in the 160 CLLs (CLL020).
Gene Expression Proﬁling
Total RNA was isolated from viably frozen PBMCs or B cells from CLL patients that were followed longitudinally (Midi kit; QIAGEN,
Valencia CA), and hybridized to the U133Plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Cruz, CA) at the DFCI Microarray Core Facility. All expres-
sion proﬁles were processed using RMA, implemented by the PreprocessData set module in GenePattern (http://www.
broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/) (Irizarry et al., 2003; Reich et al., 2006). Probes were collapsed to unique genes
by selecting the probe with the maximal average expression for each gene. Batch effects were further removed using the ComBat
module in GenePattern(Johnson et al., 2007) (Reich et al., 2006). Visualizations in GENE-E (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/
software/GENE-E) were based on logarithmic transformation (log2) of the data and centering each gene (zero mean). These data
can be accessed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/linking.html with accession number GSE37168.
RNA Pyrosequencing for Mutation Conﬁrmation
Quantitative targeted sequencing to detect somatic mutation within cDNA was performed, as previously described (Armistead et al.,
2008). In brief, biotinylated amplicons generated from PCR of the regions of transcript surrounding the mutation of interest were
generated. Immobilized biotinylated single-stranded DNA fragments were isolated per manufacturer’s protocol, and sequencing
undertaken using an automated pyrosequencing instrument (PSQ96; QIAGEN, Valencia CA), followed by quantitative analysis using
Pyrosequencing software (QIAGEN).
Statistical Methods
Statistical analysis was performed with MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA), R version 2.11.1 and SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC). Categorical variables were compared using the Fisher Exact test, and continuous variables were compared using the Student’s
t test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, or Kruskal Wallis test as appropriate; the association between two continuous variables was assessed
by the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient. The time from the date of sample to ﬁrst therapy or death (failure-free survival from sample time
or FFS_Sample) was calculated as the time from sample to the time of the ﬁrst treatment after the sample or death and was censored
at the date of last contact. FFS_Rx (failure-free survival from ﬁrst treatment after sampling) was deﬁned as the time to the 2nd treat-
ment or death from the 1st treatment following sampling, was calculated only for those patients who had a 1st treatment after the
sample and was censored at the date of last contact for those who had only one treatment after the sample. Time to event data
were estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier, and differences between groups were assessed using the log-rank test. Unad-
justed and adjusted Cox modeling was performed to assess the impact of the presence of a subclonal driver and a driver irrespective
of the CCF on FFS_Sample and FFS_Rx. A chi-square test with 1 degree of freedom and the 2 Log-likelihood statistic was used to
test the prognostic independence of subclonal status in Cox modeling using a full model and one without subclonal status included.
We also formally tested for non-proportionality of the hazards in Figure 6B First, we plotted the log(-log(survival) versus log(time) for
the two categories, and demonstrated that curves do not cross, which supports the fact that they are proportional. Second, we also
tested for non-proportionality by including a time varying covariate for each variable in the model. None of these were signiﬁcant indi-
cating that the hazards are proportional. Models were adjusted for known prognostic factors for CLL treatment including the pres-
ence of a 17p deletion, the presence of a 11q deletion, IGHV mutational status, and prior treatment at the time of sample. Cytogenetic
abnormalities were primarily assessed by FISH and if unknown, genomic data were included. For unknown IGHV mutational status an
indicator was included in adjusted modeling and was not found to be signiﬁcant. All P-values are two-sided and considered signif-
icant at the 0.05 level unless otherwise noted.
