INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a largely incurable hemato-
logic malignancy characterized by the aberrant proliferation 
of clonal plasma cells (PC) within the bone marrow (BM), 
which develops from the asymptomatic disease stages known 
as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance 
(MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). The 
initial diagnosis of MGUS or SMM remains an incidental 
process depending on the identification of increased mono-
clonal protein in the blood, yet BM biopsy is the gold stand-
ard for diagnosis and monitoring of progression to MM. 
BM biopsy is an intrusive and painful procedure for patients 
having an asymptomatic condition and does not allow for 
multiple samples to be acquired frequently over the course 
of disease development to monitor tumor dynamics. Moreo-
ver, next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies of MM have 
established a complex clonal architecture with the existence 
of genetic heterogeneity (1–7) and spatial heterogeneity (8, 9) 
characterizing disease. Thus, localized BM biopsy alone is not 
able to represent the full pathology of disease. This presents a 
need for improvement in robust early detection methods that 
are tumor biology based, are able to capture the full temporal 
and spatial nature of disease and, ideally, are minimally inva-
sive for patients.
Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are malignant cells that 
extravasate from the primary BM site to the peripheral blood 
(PB) and therefore are amenable to enrichment, enumera-
tion, and molecular characterization of genetic biomarkers. 
They present an opportunity to assess the representation 
of BM tumor biology and are an emerging area of research 
as a marker of MM disease. As blood draws are readily pos-
sible and repeatable, there are many potential advantages for 
clinical use in settings of early detection, real-time monitor-
ing, and assessment of treatment response and clonal evo-
lution. Early investigations in the field have demonstrated 
the promise of liquid biopsy in all stages throughout MM, 
with enumeration studies highlighting the prognostic value 
of CTCs (10–15). Due to the rare nature of CTCs, low cell 
numbers can be recovered using enrichment strategies for 
downstream genomic profiling. In most cases, whole-genome 
amplification (WGA) is required to increase DNA template 
for input into library construction protocols. WGA has inher-
ent issues such as allelic distortion/dropout and nonuni-
formity of coverage that can affect reliable mutation calling 
across the genome, thus limiting analyses of these samples 
to targeted approaches and considerations of multiple rep-
licates and census-based mutation calling. Notwithstanding, 
targeted NGS studies using whole-exome or custom panels 
have demonstrated the ability of CTCs to successfully capture 
clonal driver mutations and copy-number variants of MM, 
similar to matched BM sample analyses (16–19), but fail to 
capture translocations. These findings suggest that not only 
enumeration but quantitative disease monitoring of patients 
may be possible at regular intervals. However, the reliability 
of genome-wide methods that can capture chromosomal 
ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) develops from well-defined precursor stages; however, 
invasive bone marrow (BM) biopsy limits screening and monitoring strategies for 
patients. We enumerated circulating tumor cells (CTC) from 261 patients (84 monoclonal gammopa-
thy of undetermined significance, 155 smoldering multiple myeloma, and 22 MM), with neoplastic 
cells detected in 84%. We developed a novel approach, MinimuMM-seq, which enables the detection 
of translocations and copy-number abnormalities through whole-genome sequencing of highly pure 
CTCs. Application to CTCs in a cohort of 51 patients, 24 with paired BM, was able to detect 100% of 
clinically reported BM biopsy events and could replace molecular cytogenetics for diagnostic yield and 
risk classification. Longitudinal sampling of CTCs in 8 patients revealed major clones could be tracked 
in the blood, with clonal evolution and shifting dynamics of subclones over time. Our findings provide 
proof of concept that CTC detection and genomic profiling could be used clinically for monitoring and 
managing disease in MM.
SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we established an approach enabling the enumeration and sequencing of 
CTCs to replace standard molecular cytogenetics. CTCs harbored the same pathognomonic MM abnor-
malities as BM plasma cells. Longitudinal sampling of serial CTCs was able to track clonal dynamics 
over time and detect the emergence of high-risk genetic subclones.

translocations together with copy-number variants and 
mutations in a single unbiased assay has yet to be shown, 
and previous studies have been largely limited by low tumor 
purity and high DNA template input requirements.
Here, we describe a novel technique, minimally invasive 
multiple myeloma sequencing (MinimuMM-seq), which lev-
erages advancements in tumor cell enrichment strategies, 
low input library construction, and tailored cancer genomics 
analyses to enable whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of CTCs 
for systematic genomic profiling of pathognomonic MM 
events. First, we establish the concordance of MinimuMM-seq 
results in paired BM and CTC samples from 24 patients. Sub-
sequently, the clinical utility and performance are demon-
strated in a cohort of PB-only CTC samples from 27 patients. 
We show that longitudinal serial sampling is able to unravel 
the clonal architecture and dynamics of CTC expansion 
and extinction over time for 8 patients. Finally, our method 
enables WGS-based risk classification of patients. This study 
provides proof of principle for a minimally invasive liquid 
biopsy–based screening method for the early detection and 
monitoring of MM.
RESULTS
Detection and Enumeration of CTCs Correlate with 
Precursor Disease Pathology
To evaluate the frequency of CTCs in precursor disease 
stages, PB was collected from 239 untreated patients across 
asymptomatic stages of MM, including 84 MGUS and 155 
SMM, for the enrichment and capture of CTCs using the 
CellSearch platform with the Circulating Multiple Myeloma 
Cell Assay (Menarini Silicon Biosystems), which requires 
4 mL of blood per test (Fig. 1A). The majority of precursor 
patients showed evidence of CTCs, with one or more CTCs 
detected in 82% of enrolled patients, with 75% of MGUS (63 
patients) and 86% of SMM (134 patients) having successful 
enumeration (Fig. 1B). An increase in the number of CTCs 
was observed between MGUS and SMM disease stages, with a 
median count of 3 (range, 0–1,328) and 23 (range, 0–43,836), 
respectively (P  <  0.0001; Fig.  1C). Peripheral blood from a 
cohort of newly diagnosed MM patients was also collected 
(n = 22), with a median enumeration of 324 (range, 1–32,071) 
at the overt disease stage (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
We next assessed whether CTC counts correlated with clini-
cal parameters that are monitored for signs of progression or 
risk stratification in SMM to determine whether an associa-
tion with current staging or disease risk is evident. A moderate 
positive correlation was observed between the number of CTCs 
enumerated from patients and their bone marrow PC (BMPC) 
percentage [r  =  0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.29–0.61; 
P  <  0.0001; Supplementary Fig.  S1B], and to a lesser extent 
with the M-spike concentration (r  =  0.32; 95% CI: 0.11–0.50; 
P = 0.003; Supplementary Fig. S1C). A proportion of patients 
with SMM in the cohort had clinical BM biopsy performed 
(n = 94) with results available for the assessment of risk clas-
sification using the International Myeloma Working Group 
2/20/20 model (20). Enumeration of CTCs correlated with this 
model, in which a higher CTC count was associated with an 
increased risk group based on the three-risk factor model, with 
a median of 5, 24, and 170 CTCs detected in low-, intermediate-, 
and high-risk SMM groups, respectively (Fig. 1D). We note that 
the median CTC count in low-risk SMM was similar to that 
found in MGUS, fittingly reflective of early disease categori-
zation. CTC counts were found to be significantly increased 
at intermediate-risk (P < 0.01) and high-risk (P < 0.01) stages 
compared with the low-risk group. Survival analysis using the 
Kaplan–Meier method showed that SMM patients with detected 
CTCs have higher chances of progression (CTC count ≥ 1/4 mL 
of blood, likelihood ratio test statistic 4.57, P = 0.03; Fig. 1E) 
over a median follow-up time of 27 months [interquartile range 
(IQR), 21–32 months]. The association remained true when 
comparing quartiles of CTC counts (P = 0.04; Supplementary 
Fig. S1D), and more specifically the lowest, Q1 (0–2 CTC/4 mL 
of blood), against Q2, Q3, and Q4 (P = 0.005; Supplementary 
Fig.  S1E). Taken together, these data illustrate that as the 
tumor burden of disease increases, there is an increase in the 
release and trafficking of tumor cells from the BM to the PB, 
which may be predictive of disease staging and monitored by 
enumeration of CTCs.
MinimuMM-seq Reveals that CTCs Reflect the 
Major BM Clone and Could Replace Molecular 
Cytogenetics
Enumeration of CTCs provides a correlative measure of 
disease burden; however, molecular characterization can con-
firm tumor biology and MM-associated genetic alterations. 
We first characterized enriched CTCs that were isolated in 
our workflow to confirm they were malignant cells of good 
quality and morphology through imaging and ultralow pass 
(ULP) WGS and ichorCNA. CTCs were found to be intact 
and to harbor arm-level somatic copy-number abnormalities, 
in concordance with matched BM results (Supplementary 
Fig. S2A and S2B; Supplementary Materials and Methods). 
We next set to establish the minimum number of CTCs that 
could be recovered and sequenced, without loss of sensitivity 
for the detection of initiating events of MM, when the ground 
truth of BM fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was 
known. Our quantitative evaluation revealed the lowest limit 
of detection when 50 CTCs were recovered (Supplementary 
Fig. S2C; Supplementary Materials and Methods).
With this foundation, we then investigated the clinical 
utility of genomic profiling of CTCs using standard WGS 
without WGA as an unbiased method to detect abnormalities 
present in CTCs. The clinical characteristics of all participants 
are highlighted in Supplementary Table S1, and sequencing 
metrics are summarized in Supplementary Table S2. Overall, 
a median of 394 CTCs (range, 41–75,000) and 11,700 BMPCs 
(range, 124–49,000 for matched sample patients) were iso-
lated and sequenced (Fig. 2A) with paired germline samples 
as a reference normal comparison. Our enrichment approach 
yielded a median tumor purity of 99% (range, 48%–100%) and 
98% (range, 45%–100%) for both BMPCs and CTCs, respec-
tively, with quantification by ABSOLUTE (ref. 21; Fig. 2B).
To first illustrate that CTCs could deliver equivalent 
genomic yield compared with clinical BM testing, we col-
lected matched PB and BM research samples at the same time 
point of clinic visit from 24 patients (2 MGUS, 15 SMM, and 
7 MM). All patients with a BM biopsy had routine molecular 
cytogenetics performed at clinical pathology, and FISH analy-
sis was recorded (Supplementary Materials and Methods).

Clinical FISH reported that 11 patients (46%) harbored 
translocations, 9 patients (37%) had trisomies/copy-number 
changes, and 4 patients (17%) had inconclusive results, with 
BM biopsies showing PC infiltrations in the range of 5% to 
80% (Supplementary Table S3). Head-to-head comparison of 
WGS with FISH probes that were tested showed sequencing 
of CTCs was able to detect 100% (N = 44) of abnormalities 
identified in clinical testing with copy-number and structural 
variant probes (Fig.  2C). Notably, new clinically reportable 
high-risk events of IGH–MYC [t(8;14)] translocations and 
1q gain were distinguished in 3 patients by WGS, with con-
cordance between CTC and BM compartments, but were 
not found by FISH (n  =  3, over 97 successful probes with 
negative results).
Overall comparison of large-scale events across all patients 
showed a high concordance of genetic profile between WGS 
and FISH. Matched CTCs and BMPCs were confirmed to orig-
inate from the same clonal expansion through B-cell recep-
tor repertoire characterization (Supplementary Table  S4). 
Genomic results demonstrate that CTCs are able to faithfully 
recapitulate all results obtained from ground truth BM, 
including translocations [t(11;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), t(4;14), 
and t(8;14)] and copy-number abnormalities (chromosomal 
trisomies, 1q gain, deletion 13q, and deletion 16q; Fig. 2D).

Moreover, WGS of CTCs was able to identify additional 
genetic events in 20 patients (83%; Fig.  2D, green text). In 
particular, 4 patients with SMM (CTF001, CTF017, CTF036, 
and CTF048) had FISH within normal limits or failure due 
to insufficient PC during clinical testing; however, analysis of 
CTCs was able to detect and recover cytogenetic abnormality 
results. In CTF001, we detected MAF translocation t(14;16), 
1q gain, and copy-loss events on chromosomes 13 and 22. 
Interestingly, this patient had a BM biopsy with clinical FISH 
performed again 1 year after this sampling time point, being 
successful and reporting t(14;16), deletion 17p, monosomy 
13, and 1q gain. In CTF017, a novel IGH–MAFB [t(14;20)] 
translocation and deletion 13q were detected. In CTF036, tri-
somies and deletion 13q were found, whereas in CTF048 tri-
somies and deletion 6q and 8p were identified. These results 
highlight that blood-based screening of CTCs can reliably 
detect alterations to replace BM, even when routine clinical 
BM fails, to assist with tumor classification.
MinimuMM-seq Enables Genomic Profiling of CTCs 
for Unbiased WGS-Based Molecular Analyses
As the characterization of CTCs proved feasible, we next 
explored the utility of PB sampling and WGS of CTCs as a 
diagnostic tool for minimally invasive detection of molecu-
lar events in patients in the absence of a BM reference. To 
extend our assessment and demonstrate the applicability of 
MinimuMM-seq as a clinical tool, we collected a validation 
cohort of prospective PB-only samples from 27 patients 
(3 MGUS, 22 SMM, and 2 MM).
We demonstrate comprehensive detection of chromosomal 
abnormalities, with the ability to detect key translocations 
and copy-number variants of MM across all patients using 
CTCs (Fig.  3A). Sixteen patients (59%) harbored transloca-
tions, including frequent and infrequent translocations such 
as t(11;14), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), t(6;14), and t(8;14). 
Eleven patients (41%) showed trisomies and copy-number 
changes including 1q gain, 1p deletion, odd chromosomal 
trisomies, and deletion 13q. Due to the asymptomatic nature 
of precursor patients, all were under careful clinical observa-
tion and most patients had a BM biopsy and FISH analyses 
performed at one time point during their ongoing monitor-
ing, which was used as a known reference (Supplementary 
Table S5). Evaluation of WGS of CTCs in comparison with 
FISH probes that were tested on BM firmly showed that CTCs 
were able to detect 100% of abnormalities identified in clinical 
testing (Fig. 3B). In 6 patients (CTF022, 026, 027, 029, 040, 
and 044), no clinical FISH data were available (normal or 
insufficient cells); however, genomic characterization of CTCs 
revealed the presence of trisomies, t(14;16), rare IGH–MAFA 
translocation [t(8;14)], and deletion 1p and 13q, which are 
important cytogenetic abnormalities with a predictive value 
for the clinical understanding of a premalignant patient.
As such, we highlight two key examples of the application in 
blood sampling of SMM finding high-risk events. Participant 
CTF031’s clinical testing showed t(14;16) and deletion of 8q, 
13q, and 17p. Additionally, we found a sensitivity of WGS 
to layer in mutations with the detection of single-nucleotide 
variants (SNV) in TP53, inducing a likely pathogenic variant 
p.E285K (22). Notably, this result confers a biallelic double-hit 
event, which is a high-risk category for patients with MM that 
conventional testing would not be able to uncover (Fig. 3C). 
From clinical reports, participant CTF025 harbored an IGH 
separation, a 1q gain, and trisomies. WGS of CTCs revealed the 
unknown translocation with chromosome 14 to be IGH–MYC 
[t(8;14)], with additional trisomies and NRAS hotspot muta-
tion p.Q61H. Studies have shown MYC–IGH translocations as 
high-risk events compared with non-IgH MYC translocations, 
indicating an increased potential for progression from SMM 
to MM within 2 years (refs. 23, 24; Fig. 3D). Taken together, 
these results exemplify the resolution afforded by sequencing-
based methods to characterize tumor biology for improved 
clinical decisions on early intervention strategies.
Longitudinal Liquid Biopsy and Serial WGS 
of CTCs Reveal Clonal Architecture and 
Evolutionary History
As PB continuously circulates, liquid biopsy sampling may 
be affected by the phenomena of spatial and temporal het-
erogeneity in CTC burden. In patients with matched samples, 
we investigated whether the major BM clone possessed the 
potential to extravasate and circulate or whether the pref-
erential circulation of subclones occurred. We showed that 
large-scale copy-number and IgH translocations are shared 
between both BM and CTCs (Fig. 2D). We then calculated the 
sensitivity to detect point mutations in CTCs and BM given 
purity, ploidy, and sequencing depth of coverage (Supple-
mentary Fig. S3A–S3C). Sensitivity was 99% (IQR, 92%–100%) 
for clonal events [cancer cell fraction (CCF)  =  1], and 75% 
(IQR, 43%–94%) for mutations occurring  ≥  50% CCF. Two 
patients with matched BMPCs fell below an average detection 
power of 80% for clonal events due to their low number of 
captured CTCs (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Total mutational 
load across all samples was in the range of 1,000 to 9,000 
SNVs and short insertions or deletions (indels), in line with 
the expected burden from previous genome studies of MM 
PCs (refs. 2, 3, 25; Supplementary Fig. S3D). At the genome-
wide scale, mutations were more likely to be shared between 
both compartments (Supplementary Fig.  S3D), indicating 
the shared clonal history of BMPCs and CTCs. In participant 
CTF013, this is exemplified by a high mutation density at the 
upper diagonal (100% CCF), with t(14;16) and the first KRAS 
hotspot mutant (p.G12S) cluster (Fig. 4A, part i). A second 
high-density cluster was found with the second KRAS hotspot 
(p.G13D), having a vertical shift from the diagonal suggest-
ing it is preferentially found in the PB compartment. Next, we 
used PhylogicNDT (26) to cluster mutations and copy-num-
ber abnormalities into branching subclones and found that 
KRAS p.G12S is indeed predicted to be a shared clonal event 
(green), whereas KRAS p.G13D belongs to a subclonal branch 
(blue, Fig. 4A, part ii; Supplementary Fig. S3E). This suggests 
that KRAS p.G13D confers an additional fitness advantage 
to tumor cells and indeed is more common than the p.G12S 
mutation in the MM disease setting (27).
As clonal complexity is not limited to spatial heterogene-
ity, but also temporal changes over time, we analyzed serial 
samples from 8 cases of SMM (CTF004, 013, 017, 019, 024, 
027, 031, and 032), of which 7 patients remained under care-
ful clinical observation without treatment (time range, 2–33 
months). In all cases, we validated the stability of the major 
clone, with the clonal evolution and shifting dynamics of

CTC subclones over time (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Expan-
sion of subclones harboring MM driver mutations such as 
KRAS (both G12 and G13 hotspots) and DIS3 was observed, 
indicating their potential to confer a selective advantage for 
clonal fitness and independence for circulation (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S4B). In an example case of CTF004, longitudinal 
sampling over 28 months demonstrated the reliability of our 
approach for diagnostic sampling based on liquid biopsy, 
with stability of mutation presence with clonal t(11;14) and 
gain of 11q validated at both time points (Fig.  4B, part i). 
Additionally, over time, an emergent subclone with increased 
clonal fitness appeared harboring an additional deletion of 
13q, growing from a CCF of 8% (blue; CI: 8%–9%) at T0 to 
CCF of 80% at T1 (CI: 75%–84%), whereas simultaneous 
extinction of the orange subclone was observed (Fig. 4B, part 
ii). These data demonstrate the use of CTCs to successfully 
track both acquisition of mutations and clonal dynamics of 
MM disease over time in a minimally invasive manner.
Of the 8 patients with serial blood collection, one SMM 
(CTF032) received early interventional treatment following 
first blood collection and CTC sequencing. After 4 months of 
therapy, the patient achieved a partial response with serum

p.G12S activating hotspot mutation showed a relative CCF 
increase from 41% (CI: 40%–42%) to 92% (CI: 91%–93%). The 
patient progressed to overt MM after the end of treatment, 
whereas PhylogicNDT modeling predicted that clones bear-
ing KRAS p.G12S were selected in combination with other 
mutants that are part of the dark red branch also bearing 
USH2A p.I362T, a gene recurrently mutated in POEMS syn-
drome (29). Selection of the new fittest clone under treatment 
is revealed by our minimally invasive method before any 
potential resistance is clinically observed.
Genomic Profiling of CTCs Can Replace Clinical BM 
FISH for Risk Classification of Patients
In the genomics era, implementation of clinical sequencing 
to improve the stratification of patients based on genomic bio-
markers has high potential, going beyond the use of correla-
tive clinical markers alone in models such as the International 
Myeloma Working Group 2/20/20 for SMM (20) and Interna-
tional Staging System (ISS) for MM (30). Detection of chro-
mosomal abnormalities has been implemented to extend both 
systems [which became the four-factor model and the Revised 
ISS (ref. 31), respectively]. The ability to use genomic profiling 
of CTCs for this stratification would provide a minimally inva-
sive and repeatable solution to refine patient classification.
Sequencing of CTCs was able to detect all reported high-risk 
prognostic factors including t(4;14), t(14;16) 1q gain, 
del(13q), and del(17)p. Risk stratification carried out with 
WGS of CTCs, using available cytogenetic-based risk models 
(31, 32), showed matched patients would have been assigned 
to the correct risk group when BM FISH was successful. 
Additionally, the recovery of FISH failures (due to insuffi-
cient cells for testing) or additional diagnostic yield enabled 
attribution of clinical risk (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the detection 
of novel driver mutations (KRAS, NRAS, FAM46C), MYC rear-
rangements, and signatures (APOBEC activity) by NGS is 
also shown and could help in predicting which patients are 
at high risk of transformation. Similarly, in SMM patients 
in whom only CTCs were sampled, diagnostic yield was 
obtained from MinimuMM-seq, allowing for the assignment 
of risk classification (Fig. 5B). In 5 cases of MGUS (CTF026, 
CTF029, CTF044, CTF048, and CTF054), CTCs could also 
be used to obtain a genetic result. Usually, clinical BM is not 
performed at this very early stage due to low disease burden; 
as such, minimally invasive blood testing may be a rapid solu-
tion to overcome limitations of both sampling and patient 
discomfort for a closer observation of patients with MGUS. 
We note no cytogenetic risk association models for MGUS 
are present, but we observed trisomies, t(14;20), 1q gain, 
and deletion of 13q, potentially detailing high-risk patients. 
Taken together, these data show that genomic assessment 
of CTCs provides demonstrable results that match BM sam-
pling and the potential of the power of their clinical applica-
tion for cytogenetic assessment of patients.
CTC Sequencing Enables Cohort-Level Genomic 
Study of Mutational Signatures and Complex 
Structural Events
As WGS is an NGS technology that can sequence the entire 
genome, we reasoned that its application in CTCs may also 
provide more comprehensive mutation data across all scales 
without prior knowledge. Mutation and structural variant 
counts are summarized in Supplementary Tables S6 and S7. 
Mutations in the RAS–MAPK pathway are the most preva-
lent and significantly mutated drivers in MM, with KRAS 
and NRAS mutated in 21% and 19.5% of patients with MM 
(1, 5, 6), respectively. We found clonal and subclonal MAPK 
mutations of KRAS and NRAS in 12 patients out of 51 (24%), 
including hotspot mutations of G12, G13, and Q61 (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4C). We also found mutations in 6 driver 
genes of MM (BRAF, DIS3, FAM46C, KRAS, NRAS, and TP53) 
in 17 patients (33%; Supplementary Fig. S4D), with concord-
ance between CTCs and matched BM. All mutations found in 
CTCs in driver genes were validated in the BM compartment 
by specifically looking for sequencing reads that support the 
mutant allele (Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4E).
In addition to the detection of somatic mutations, muta-
tional processes and their distinctive signatures are impor-
tant features in MM. Previous studies have revealed the 
contribution of AID, APOBEC, and aging signatures to the 
mutational spectrum of MM (2, 33, 34). Recent studies 
highlighted that they may have clinical importance in SMM 
(35, 36), with APOBEC shown to be enriched in those 
patients who progress or have a shorter time to progression. 
Mutation spectra and signature activity analysis reveals a 
comparable overlap of mutation types found between BM 
and CTCs (median cosine similarity 98%; IQR, 94%–99%; 
Supplementary Fig. S5A). Signatures extracted in our dataset 
comprised APOBEC, clock-like, and SBS9 as annotated by 
SignatureAnalyzer (Fig. 6A), with the comparable contribu-
tion of mutational processes to the CTC and BM compart-
ments (Supplementary Fig. S5B). In line with the literature, 
we show all participants with APOBEC contribution of more 
than 25% to the mutation spectrum were of MAF subtype 
(n = 7/51, either IGH–MAF, MAFA, or MAFB). Finally, because 
WGS is not biased toward coding regions of the genome, 
we could decipher more complex structural events such as 
chromothripsis of chromosome 3 in CTF033 (Fig. 6B and C) 
and chromoplexy of chromosomes 7, 8, and 18 involving the 
MYC locus in matched BM and PB of CTF034 (Fig. 6D and E). 
Overall, we showed that additional novel information not 
found by routine clinical tests can be gained from CTCs that 
could be layered into patient assessment.
DISCUSSION
Liquid biopsy studies in MM have demonstrated the 
clinical potential of CTC assessment (37, 38) similar to that 
of CTCs in solid tumors. However, these early investiga-
tions focused on the predictive value of enumeration in 
disease staging and risk of progression or targeted genomics 
(16–19). As such, the full potential of genomic profiling of 
CTCs has yet to be realized, with no study implementing 
unbiased genome-wide methods that could capture any 
mutation type without prior knowledge. Here, we show 
proof of principle that both enumeration and molecular 
analyses of CTCs using WGS have clinical utility in MM. We 
demonstrate MinimuMM-seq for comprehensive genomic 
characterization of CTCs, which robustly matches data 
derived from BM samples, could be used as a surrogate

Genomic Profiling of Circulating Multiple Myeloma Cells
RESEARCH ARTICLE
	
FEBRUARY  2023 CANCER DISCOVERY | 359 
of nucleic acids from this minute cell fraction pose significant 
technical challenges, precluding their extensive molecular 
characterization. Our study is the first to show intact CTCs 
can be purified and used to detect complex structural events 
and chromosomal abnormalities that are hallmarks of MM 
disease. This is a substantial advance demonstrating that ini-
tiating events of MM can be detected upon genomic profiling 
of CTCs a priori with similar sensitivity and specificity to clini-
cal BM FISH. Importantly, our method can be the basis for 
clinical applications that use liquid biopsies to assay genomic 
biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, in which 
screening and monitoring of MM clones can be achieved 
using blood sampling only.
The prevalence of MGUS in the general population is esti-
mated to be 3% to 5% of individuals aged over 50 years, and 
SMM to be 0.53% of individuals aged over 40 years old (39–42). 
Screening may be especially important for the SMM stage, 
which is heterogeneous and captures multiple clinical trajec-
tories of disease including “MGUS-like,” indolent, or “early 
MM–like” (43). Capturing high-risk patients before end-organ 
damage occurs is of especially high importance for decisions 
on clinical management strategies. Using MinimuMM-seq, 
we observed CTCs indeed represent the major BM clone upon 
blood sampling, with a high concordance of genomic pro-
file between both compartments, illustrating that dominant 
clones in the BM possess the fitness to circulate and define 
the current tumors’ biology. Initiating mutational profiles 
included primary translocations of t(11;14), t(4;14), t(14;16), 
and t(14;20). A similar representation of the overall clonal com-
plexity in PB compared with BM was observed in matched sam-
ple patients. Notably, in few cases we observed subclones with 
preferential circulation in the PB compartment, harboring 
driver mutations such as KRAS conferring improved fitness. 
This shows that blood sampling and screening of CTCs are suf-
ficient to reliably identify mutations of the BM to screen and 
monitor patients for initiating clones and potentially emerging 
high-risk clones that may have more aggressive characteristics. 
Although genomic analyses of MM have not yielded targeted 
therapies to date [with the exception of venetoclax in t(11;14) 
patients], improved molecular profiling using CTCs and BM 
could indeed help to better stratify patients for clinical deci-
sions using current models such as the four-risk factor 2/20/20 
model (for SMM; ref.  20) or Revised ISS (31) or mSMART 
models (for MM; ref. 44). Targeting actionable mutations such 
as CDK, RAS/RAF, and t(11;14) is currently being investigated 
within the MyDRUG trial (NCT03732703).
Although BM remains the gold standard for diagnosis, 
recent studies have highlighted the importance of spatial het-
erogeneity in MM disease, a feature that is well known from 
functional imaging (9, 45, 46). As such, current methods of 
BM biopsy at a single iliac crest or sternal site may not accu-
rately represent the full picture of tumor biology, potentially 
missing high-risk genomic events of prognostic interest such 
as TP53 mutations (9). In this study, we showed that high-risk 
arm-level abnormalities of 1q gain and deletion of chromo-
some 13 could be found at a higher CCF in blood-derived 
CTCs than in BM biopsy samples of the same time point. 
Conversely, we did not detect any high-risk events occurring 
exclusively in BM. Furthermore, similar observations applied 
to driver mutations detected in KRAS and NRAS, which were 
all found to be of equal or higher clonality in the blood com-
pared with BM. Thus, CTCs may assist in defining spatial 
genomic architecture and systemic disease through the detec-
tion of private mutations upon PB sampling not found in the 
standard BM biopsy site. This suggests that capturing CTCs 
could give us a major unexpected advantage over BM biopsies 
in that CTCs harboring such abnormalities lose dependence 
and diffuse into the blood from proliferative niches through-
out the body before they settle and induce a clonal sweep 
and fixation at a primary or secondary regional site. Further 
studies of longitudinal abnormalities in matched BM and PB 
compartments will help elucidate this hypothesis.
MinimuMM-seq for CTCs also addresses the current chal-
lenge of repeated sampling of patients for the continuous 
monitoring of disease development and tumor evolution. 
CTCs at a single time point can provide an assessment of 
genomic profile and actionable mutations, whereas longitu-
dinal blood collection at multiple time points can track muta-
tion architecture and clonal dynamics through CTCs, similar 
to that of the major BM clone, in a minimally invasive man-
ner. In particular, we showed a serial sampling of blood from 
untreated patients with SMM can be used to identify the 
clonal complexity, phylogeny, and evolution of CTCs, where 
emergence (of high-risk subclones with selective advantage) 
and extinction (of passenger subclones) are observed over time. 
Conceivably, this approach could also be applied in a treat-
ment setting to provide evidence for response or resistance, 
restaging, and end-of-trial assessment in which BM is unable 
to be collected, and measure how the fitness landscape changes 
with treatment pressure. Indeed, in one patient with SMM who 
began receiving early interventional therapy, we show that lon-
gitudinal liquid biopsies monitoring CTCs provide informa-
tion on clonal dynamics and selection of high-risk subclones 
that emerge in real time. This observation illustrates that 
dense sampling of blood for genomic profiling may assist in 
closely tracking patient response and tailoring changes given a 
patient's specific evolving biology and clonal composition. As 
WGS becomes less expensive, we believe that this approach will 
be easily accessible and may become more affordable than tra-
ditional FISH for clinical application. Many tests using NGS, 
including germline WGS, have been introduced in recent years, 
and this category will likely continue to expand. Furthermore, 
at MRD testing time points, we observed CTCs are rarely pre-
sent in the PB when patients were either MRD positive or MRD 
negative by NGS evaluation. This is similar to previous studies 
showing high false negativity of noninvasive MRD assessment

by monitoring CTCs as a measure of MRD burden after treat-
ment compared with BM (15).
We also consider the limitations present in our study. Com-
pared with higher burden SMM and overt MM, a minority 
of MGUS, lower risk SMM, and MRD status patients may be 
eligible for genomic characterization by MinimuMM-seq at 
the first sampling date; however, monitoring by enumeration 
and moving to genomic characterization when CTC numbers 
increase could coincide with the time at which such an assay is 
relevant in the disease course. In particular, patients on treat-
ment and being assessed for MRD may benefit from a regular 
serial sampling of PB for CTC burden as an assessment of 
the duration of MRD status. Our current results suggest 
copy-number abnormalities face no lower limit of detection, 
whereas translocations could be detected in samples down 
to 50 CTCs and clonal mutations were reliably detected from 
around 300 CTCs. In this study, we relied on affinity-based 
selection of PCs (CD138+38+), and we note CTCs could be 
missed due to potential dynamic surface protein expression 
or clonogenic potential of CD138− cells (47–49). Whether the 
physical properties of PCs such as morphology could be a sen-
sitive way to purify CTCs of premalignant disease remains to 
be tested. Although we focused on genetic alterations, future 
transcriptomics studies using single-cell RNA sequencing may 
also define phenotypic characteristics and traits that allow 
CTCs to extravasate, and whether high-risk or rare clones pos-
sess circulating specific functional features (17, 50–52).
MinimuMM-seq provides a foundation for minimally inva-
sive detection, enumeration, and genomic interrogation of 
rare CTCs from the PB, illustrating the clinical potential of 
using liquid biopsies for monitoring and managing disease 
in MM. Addressing costs and strategies to bring WGS into 
the clinical standard of care will consequently provide an 
unbiased test to improve on and refine genomic biomarker 
assessment for patient diagnostics. Ultimately, CTCs possess 
great potential to enable precision oncology and prevention 
in MM and its precursor conditions.
METHODS
Patient Sample Collection
Blood samples from a cohort of 261 patients (84 MGUS, 155 
SMM, and 22 MM) were prospectively collected from the Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute Observational Precursor Crowd (PCROWD) 
study (NCT02269592) and the Plasma Cell Dyscrasias study. All 
patients provided written informed consent for the research use col-
lection of PB and BM samples (Institutional Review Board #14-174 
and #07-150). Research studies were carried out in accordance with 
the Declaration of Helsinki. PB was drawn into CellRescue Preserva-
tive Tubes (Menarini Silicon Biosystems) and kept at room tempera-
ture before processing on the CellSearch instrument. Samples were 
all processed within 96 hours from the time of collection. Patients 
with matched BM biopsies had routine clinical cytogenetics and 
FISH analysis performed at a molecular pathology laboratory (Sup-
plementary Materials and Methods).
Enrichment and Enumeration of CTCs
From each patient, PB was collected in CellRescue Preservation 
Tubes (Menarini Silicon Biosystems) and processed on the CellSearch 
System (Menarini Silicon Biosystems) composed of the CELLTRACKS 
AUTOPREP System and the CELLTRACKS ANALYZER II using the 
CELLSEARCH Circulating Multiple Myeloma Cell (CMMC) Assay 
(Menarini Silicon Biosystems) for the enrichment and enumeration 
of circulating MM cells. The sensitivity and linearity of circulating 
MM cells using the CellSearch System have previously been reported 
(11). Briefly, 4 mL of blood was removed from the CellRescue Pres-
ervation tube and processed on the CELLTRACKS AUTOPREP Sys-
tem using the CELLSEARCH CMMC Assay to enrich for myeloma 
cells following the manufacturer's recommendations. Myeloma cells 
were immunomagnetically captured using an anti-CD138 antibody 
conjugated with ferrofluid. All captured cells were stained with an 
anti-CD38 antibody conjugated with phycoerythrin (PE), an anti-
CD19/CD45 antibody cocktail conjugated with allophycocyanin 
(APC), to differentiate leukocytes from the circulating myeloma cells. 
All cell nuclei were stained with DAPI and then fixed with para-
formaldehyde. The cartridges containing the enriched myeloma cells 
were placed in the CELLTRACKS ANALYZER II, a semiautomated 
fluorescence microscope. The sample was then exported from CELL-
TRACKS ANALYZER II and imported into GateWorks software. The 
GateWorks software segmented the objects in the browser images, 
extracted object features, and “gated” those events that were most 
likely to be CMMCs for review by the user. The myeloma phenotype 
was CD138+/CD38+/DAPI+/CD19−/CD45−. Any background cells 
such as leukocytes, which had the phenotype CD138−/CD38−/DAPI+/
CD19+/CD45+, were not counted as myeloma cells. Samples were then 
removed from the cartridges and stored in glycerol stocks at −20°C 
for subsequent downstream molecular characterization.
Sorting of CTCs
Upon enrichment of PB samples using The CellSearch Sys-
tem, ∼100–10,000 leukocytes may remain in the background of the 
extracted sample; therefore, methods of cell sorting were used for 
sorting of pure CTCs to obtain high tumor fraction pools of CTCs. 
High-sensitivity fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; BD Bio-
sciences Aria II) was used to sort pure populations of tumor PCs and 
germline white blood cells based on immunophenotypic gating of 
CD138+38+45− and CD45+CD138−CD38−, respectively.
DNA Library Construction
Sorted samples underwent DNA purification (Thermo Fisher 
PicoPure DNA Isolation Kit) and library preparation using the 
NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) 
with unique dual index adapters (NEBNext Multiplex Oligos) accord-
ing to the manufacturer's instructions. Final library fragment sizes 
were assessed using the BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies), 
with yields quantified by a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit).
DNA Sequencing and Genomic Data Analysis
Final sample libraries were normalized and pooled before WGS was 
performed on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cells, 300 cycles paired-
end reads, at the Genomics Platform of the Broad Institute of MIT 
and Harvard. WGS analysis was performed on an in-house cloud-
based HPC system for copy-number, mutation, and structural vari-
ant analyses, and detailed steps are described in the Supplementary 
Materials and Methods. Briefly, sequencing reads were aligned to the 
hg19 reference genome with the bwa mem v0.7.7 algorithm, duplicate 
reads were marked with MarkDuplicates from picard v1.457, indels 
were realigned with GATK 3.4 IndelRealigner, and base qualities were 
recalibrated with GATK 3.4 BaseRecalibrator software. Mutations 
were called with MuTect1 (53) and small indels with Strelka2 (ref. 54; 
for SNVs and indels) and were filtered (i) against a panel of normals 
(PoN), (ii) for potential technical artifacts (oxoG), and (iii) for mul-
tiple alignment with BLAT (Supplementary Materials and Methods). 
After copy-number normalization with AllelicCapSeg, ABSOLUTE 
(21) solutions were manually reviewed to estimate mutation CCF,

purity, and ploidy of tumor samples. Phylogeny reconstruction was 
performed with the PhylogicNDT (26) suite of tools with the follow-
ing parameters: minimum CCF: 20%, minimum coverage: 10, number 
of iterations: 1,000. Mutational signatures were quantified with the 
SignatureAnalyzer (55, 56) method and n = 100 runs. Structural vari-
ants were detected and filtered as previously described (57).
Statistical Analyses
Quantitative bioclinical variables were described with median and 
IQR or absolute range or with mean and SD. The average difference 
between groups was assessed with the Kruskal–Wallis method for mul-
tiple group testing followed by Dunn post hoc tests and/or Wilcoxon test 
for two groups. When the mean is estimated from a random process, it 
is given with its 95% CI. Qualitative variables were described using the 
frequency of their respective modalities. Distinct distribution between 
groups was assessed with χ2 Pearson test (or Fisher exact test if appro-
priate). Patients were stratified for progression-free survival by the 
presence of CTCs and by quartiles of CTC enumeration. Time to event 
was calculated from screening to clinical progression to MM, or death 
of any cause, whichever occurred first. The likelihood ratio test statis-
tic is reported in the absence of an event in the nonprogressor group. 
P values were corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamini– 
Hochberg method. Adjusted P values under 0.05 were considered sig-
nificant. All calculations were done using R 4.1.1 software.
