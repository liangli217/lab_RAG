Background
The somatic genetic basis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a common and clinically 
heterogeneous leukemia occurring in adults, remains poorly understood.
Methods
We obtained DNA samples from leukemia cells in 91 patients with chronic lympho-
cytic leukemia and performed massively parallel sequencing of 88 whole exomes and 
whole genomes, together with sequencing of matched germline DNA, to characterize 
the spectrum of somatic mutations in this disease.
Results
Nine genes that are mutated at significant frequencies were identified, including 
four with established roles in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (TP53 in 15% of patients, 
ATM in 9%, MYD88 in 10%, and NOTCH1 in 4%) and five with unestablished roles 
(SF3B1, ZMYM3, MAPK1, FBXW7, and DDX3X). SF3B1, which functions at the catalytic 
core of the spliceosome, was the second most frequently mutated gene (with muta-
tions occurring in 15% of patients). SF3B1 mutations occurred primarily in tumors 
with deletions in chromosome 11q, which are associated with a poor prognosis in 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We further discovered that tumor sam-
ples with mutations in SF3B1 had alterations in pre–messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing.
Conclusions
Our study defines the landscape of somatic mutations in chronic lymphocytic leuke-
mia and highlights pre-mRNA splicing as a critical cellular process contributing to 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

C
hronic lymphocytic leukemia is an 
incurable disease characterized by exten-
sive clinical heterogeneity despite a com-
mon diagnostic immunophenotype (surface ex-
pression of CD19+, CD20+dim, CD5+, CD23+, and 
sIgMdim). Whereas the course of disease is indo-
lent in some patients, it is steadily progressive in 
approximately half of patients, leading to sub-
stantial morbidity and mortality.1 Our ability to 
predict a more aggressive disease course has im-
proved with the use of tests for biologic markers 
(degree of somatic hypermutation in the variable 
region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain [IGHV] 
gene and expression of ZAP70) and the detection 
of cytogenetic abnormalities (deletions in chromo-
somes 11q, 13q, or 17p and trisomy 12).2,3 Still, 
even with these advances, prediction of the dis-
ease course is not highly reliable.
Massively parallel sequencing technology now 
provides a means of systematically discovering 
the genetic alterations that underlie disease and 
identifying new therapeutic targets and clini-
cally predictive biomarkers. To date, most stud-
ies designed to discover tumor-associated muta-
tions have relied on sequencing the genome or 
exome of only a few tumors; the newly discov-
ered mutations detected are then further studied 
in an expanded cohort. These efforts have led to 
the identification of several important disease-
associated mutations.4-6 A more powerful ap-
proach to the process of initial discovery is to 
sequence a much larger set of samples.7,8 This 
approach increases the chances that the full 
range of mutated genes will be detected, allows 
reconstruction of the genetic pathways underly-
ing disease pathogenesis, and reveals associa-
tions between genetic events and the clinically 
important features of a disease. We therefore 
sequenced DNA samples of leukemia cells from 
91 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(88 exomes and 3 genomes), representing the 
broad clinical spectrum of the disease.
Methods
Study Design
Samples of DNA were obtained from normal tis-
sues and tumors in 91 patients (discovery cohort) 
and 101 patients (extension cohort) with chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, all of whom provided 
written informed consent before sample collec-
tion. DNA was extracted from blood- or marrow-
derived lymphocytes in tumors and from autolo-
gous epithelial cells, fibroblasts, or granulocytes 
in normal tissue. 
Genome and Exome Sequencing
Libraries were constructed and sequenced on an 
Illumina Genome Analyzer II with the use of 
101-bp paired-end reads for whole-genome se-
quencing and 76-bp paired-end reads for whole-
exome sequencing. Output from Illumina software 
was processed by the PICARD data-processing 
pipeline to yield BAM files containing well-cali-
brated, aligned reads.7,9 BAM files were pro-
cessed by the Broad Institute’s Firehose Pipeline, 
which provides quality control and identifies so-
matic point mutations, insertions or deletions, 
and other structural chromosomal rearrange-
ments. Pre–messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing 
alteration in leukemic samples was identified 
with the use of quantitative reverse-transcriptase–
polymerase-chain-reaction assays to detect spliced 
and unspliced forms of representative spliceosome 
targets BRD2 and RIOK3.10 Associations between 
mutation rate and clinical features were assessed 
with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fisher’s 
exact test, or the Kruskal–Wallis test, as appro-
priate. A stepwise Cox proportional-hazards 
model was used to identify features with a sig-
nificant effect on time to initial treatment. The 
materials and methods used in the study are 
more fully described in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org.
Results
Somatic Mutation Rate
We sequenced DNA derived from CD19+CD5+ 
leukemia cells and matched germline DNA de-
rived from autologous skin fibroblasts, epithelial 
cells in saliva, or blood granulocytes. Samples 
were obtained from patients with a broad range 
of clinical characteristics, including those with 
del(11q) and del(17p) (indicating a poor progno-
sis) and with either unmutated or mutated IGHV 
status (Fig. 1A in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Deep sequence coverage was obtained to provide 
high sensitivity in identifying mutations (Table 1). 
To detect point mutations and insertions or dele-
tions, we compared sequences in each tumor

sample with corresponding normal sequences by 
means of well-validated algorithms.7,8,11,12
We detected 1838 nonsynonymous and 539 syn-
onymous mutations in protein-coding sequences, 
corresponding to a mean (±SD) somatic mutation 
rate of 0.72±0.36 per megabase (range, 0.08 to 
2.70), and an average of 20 nonsynonymous mu-
tations per patient (range, 2 to 76) (Table 1, and 
Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix). This rate 
is similar to that previously reported in chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia and other hematologic can-
cers.5-7,13,14 We observed no significant difference 
in the rates of nonsynonymous mutation between 
tumors with mutated genes and those with un-
mutated genes or in tumors in different clinical 
stages of disease (Table 2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Prior exposure to chemotherapy (in 
30 of 91 patients) was not associated with an in-
creased rate of nonsynonymous mutation (P = 0.14) 
(Fig. 1B in the Supplementary Appendix).15
Identification of Genes with Significant 
Mutation Frequencies
To identify genes whose mutations were associ-
ated with leukemic tumorigenesis (“driver” mu-
tations), we examined all 91 leukemic and nor-
mal pairs with the use of the MutSig algorithm 
for genes that were mutated at a rate signifi-
cantly higher than the background rate, given their 
sequence composition (see the Supplementary 
Appendix). Nine such genes were identified (Q≤0.1 
after correction for multiple-hypothesis testing): 
TP53, SF3B1, MYD88, ATM, FBXW7, NOTCH1, ZMYM3, 
DDX3X, and MAPK1 (Fig. 1). Whereas the overall 
ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous muta-
tions was 3.1:1, the mutations in these nine genes 
were exclusively nonsynonymous (65:0, P<5×10−6) 
(Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix), a find-
ing that further supports their functional impor-
tance. Moreover, these mutations occurred exclu-
sively in conserved sites across species (Fig. 2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Four of the genes with significant mutation 
frequencies, TP53, ATM, MYD88, and NOTCH1, 
have been described previously in chronic lym-
phocytic leukemia.6,16-18 We found 15 TP53 mu-
tations in 14 of 91 patients (15%; Q≤6.3×10−8), 
most of which were localized to the DNA-bind-
ing domain that is critical for its tumor-suppres-
sor activity17 (Fig. 3A in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In 8 patients (9%), we detected 9 ATM 
mutations (Q≤1.1×10−5) scattered across this large 
gene, including in regions where mutation has 
been associated with defective DNA repair in 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.16 
MYD88, a critical adaptor molecule of the inter-
leukin-1 receptor–toll-like receptor (TLR) signal-
ing pathway, harbored missense mutations in 
9 patients (10%) at three sites localized within 
40 amino acids of the interleukin-1 receptor–
TLR domain. One site was novel (P258L), where-
as the other two were identical to those recently 
described as activating mutations of the nuclear 
factor κB (NF-κB)–TLR pathway in patients with 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (M232T and L265P) 
(Fig. 3C in the Supplementary Appendix).19 Fi-
nally, we detected a recurrent frameshift muta-
tion (P2514fs) in the C-terminal PEST domain of 
NOTCH1 in 4 patients (4%) that was identical to 
that recently reported in other investigations of 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia.5,6 This mutation is 
associated with unmutated IGHV and a poor prog-

nosis,5,6 and it is predicted to cause impaired deg-
radation of NOTCH1, leading to pathway activation.
Five of the genes with significant mutation 
frequencies (SF3B1, FBXW7, DDX3X, MAPK1, and 
ZMYM3) do not have established roles in chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia. Strikingly, the second most 
frequently mutated gene in our cohort was splic-
ing factor 3b, subunit 1 (SF3B1), with missense 
mutations occurring in 14 of 91 patients (15%). 
SF3B1 is a component of the SF3b complex, which 
is associated with the U2 small nuclear ribonu-
cleoprotein (snRNP) at the catalytic center of the 
spliceosome.20 SF3B1, other U2 snRNP compo-
nents, and defects in splicing are not typically 
implicated in the biology of chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia. Remarkably, all 14 mutations were lo-
calized within C-terminal PP2A-repeat regions 
5 through 8, which are highly conserved from 
humans to yeasts (Fig. 2 and 3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix), and in 7 instances, an identical 
amino acid change was produced (by the K700E 
mutation). The clustering of heterozygous muta-
tions within specific domains and at identical 
sites suggests that mutations in SF3B1, like those 
in MYD88 and NOTCH1, cause specific functional 
changes. Whereas the N-terminal domain of 
SF3B1 is known to interact directly with other 
spliceosome components,20 the precise role of 
its C-terminal domain remains unknown. Only 
6 mutations have been reported in SF3B1, all in 
solid tumors and in the PP2A-repeat region 
(Table 4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The four remaining genes with significant 
mutation frequencies have not, to our knowledge, 
been reported in previous studies of chronic lym-
phocytic leukemia and appear to have functions 
that interact with the five commonly mutated 
genes cited above (Fig. 3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). FBXW7 (four distinct mutations) is a 
ubiquitin ligase that is known to be a tumor-
suppressor gene, with loss of expression in a 
wide range of cancers.21,22 Its targets include 
important oncoproteins such as Notch1, c-Myc, 
c-Jun, cyclin E1, and MCL1.21,22 Two of the four 
mutations in FBXW7 cause constitutive Notch 
signaling in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leuke-
mia.23 DDX3X (three distinct mutations) is an 
RNA helicase that functions at multiple levels of 
RNA processing, including RNA splicing, trans-
port, and translation initiation as well as regu-
lation of an RNA-sensing proinflammatory 
pathway.24 DDX3X interacts directly with XPO1,24
which was recently reported as being mutated in 
2.4% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leuke-

mia.6 MAPK1 (three distinct mutations), also known 
as ERK, is a kinase that is involved in core cellular 
processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, 
transcription regulation, and development, and 
is a key signaling component of the TLR path-
way.25,26 Two of three distinct MAPK1 mutations 
localize to the protein kinase domain; these mu-
tations, to our knowledge, are the first reported 
examples of somatic mutations within the pro-
tein kinase domain of an ERK family member in 
a human cancer. Finally, we identified four dis-
tinct mutations in ZMYM3, a component of mul-
tiprotein complexes containing histone deacety-
lase that function to silence genes by modifying 
chromatin structure.27
We validated the three most frequently recur-
ring mutations — SF3B1–K700E, MYD88–L265P, 
and NOTCH1–P2514fs — in 101 independent paired 
tumor and germline DNA samples, with similar 
detection frequencies in the discovery and exten-
sion cohorts (P = 0.20, P = 0.58, and P = 0.38, respec-
tively) (Table 5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The nine genes with mutations at significant 
frequencies appear in five core signaling path-
ways, in which the genes play well-established 
roles: DNA repair and cell-cycle control (TP53 and 
ATM), Notch signaling (FBXW7 and NOTCH123), 
inflammatory pathways (MYD88, DDX3X, and 
MAPK1), and RNA splicing and processing (SF3B1 
and DDX3X) (Fig. 2). We also noticed that addi-
tional genes are mutated in these pathways28 
(Fig. 2, and Fig. 4 and Table 6 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Although the frequency of muta-
tions in these genes does not reach statistical 
significance, whether they are considered alone 
or as a set, it might do so in a larger collection 
of samples. On the other hand, in our cohort, 
19 of 59 genes classified as members of the Wnt 
signaling pathway, which has been implicated in 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia in gene-expression 
studies,29,30 were mutated. Although no individual 
gene had a frequency of mutation that reached 
significance, the genes involved in the Wnt path-
way, as a set, had a high mutation frequency 
(P = 0.048) (Fig. 2).
Association of Driver Mutations  
with Distinct Clinical Groups
To examine the association between driver muta-
tions and particular clinical features, we as-
sessed the cytogenetic aberrations associated 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and IGHV 
mutation status in samples harboring mutations 
in the nine genes with significant mutation fre-
quencies. We ordered the samples in accordance 
with their cytogenetic features on fluorescence 
in situ hybridization (FISH), using an established 
model of hierarchical risk3; del(13q) was associ-
ated with the most favorable prognosis when 
present alone, trisomy 12 was associated with a 
less-favorable prognosis, and del(11q) and del(17p) 
were both associated with aggressive disease that 
was refractory to chemotherapy (Fig. 3, and Tables 
7 and 8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The distinct prognostic implications of these 
cytogenetic abnormalities suggest that each ab-
normality may reflect a distinct pathogenesis. 
Our data show that different driver mutations 
are associated with different key abnormalities 
detected on FISH, providing support for this hy-
pothesis. Most of the TP53 mutations (11 of 17) 
were present in samples that also harbored del(17p) 
(P<0.001), resulting in homozygous p53 inactiva-
tion; this finding is consistent with previous ob-
servations.17 Mutations in ATM, which lies in the 
minimally deleted region of chromosome 11q, 
were marginally associated with del(11q) — that 
is, in 4 of 22 del(11q) samples (P = 0.09). Strikingly, 
mutations in SF3B1 were associated with del(11q) 
— in 8 of 22 del(11q) samples (36%, P = 0.004). 
Of the 6 leukemic samples with mutated SF3B1 
and without del(11q), 2 also harbored a hetero-
zygous mutation in ATM. These findings strongly 
suggest that there is an interaction between del(11q) 
and SF3B1 mutation in the pathogenesis of this 
clinical subgroup of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
We further observed that the mutations in 
NOTCH1 and FBXW7 were associated with triso-
my 12 (P = 0.009 and P = 0.05, respectively). As in 
previous studies,5,6 NOTCH1 mutations were con-
sistently associated with unmutated IGHV. The 
NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations were present in 
independent samples, suggesting that they may 
lead to aberrant Notch signaling in patients with 
trisomy 12 and unmutated IGHV.
All MYD88 mutations were present in samples 
that were heterozygous for del(13q) (P = 0.009). 
As indicated in recent reports,5,6 we found that 
the MYD88 mutation was always associated with 
mutations in the IGHV region (P = 0.001), which 
suggests a postgerminal-center origin. We spec-
ulate that in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as in

diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in which MYD88 
is frequently mutated,19 the constitutive activa-
tion of the NF-κB pathway may have its greatest 
effect in the germinal center.
SF3B1 Mutations
In the 192 leukemic samples in the discovery and 
extension sets, mutations in NOTCH1 were asso-
ciated with unmutated IGHV status and muta-
tions in MYD88 were associated with mutated 
IGHV status. The mutation SF3B1–K700E was as-
sociated with unmutated IGHV status (P = 0.048), 
but it was also detected in samples with mutat-
ed IGHV, which suggests that it is an indepen-
dent risk factor for chronic lymphocytic leuke-
mia (Fig. 5A in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Indeed, a Cox multivariable regression model 
designed to test for clinical factors contributing 
to an earlier initiation of treatment in the 91 
patients in the study revealed that an SF3B1 mu-
tation was predictive of an earlier need for treat-
ment (hazard ratio, 2.20; P = 0.03), independent-
ly of other established predictive markers, such 
as IGHV mutation status, del(17p), or an ATM mu-
tation (Fig. 4A).
Consistent with the results of these analyses 
was the finding that the time to initial treat-
ment for patients with the SF3B1 mutation 
alone — without del(11q) — was similar to that 
for patients with del(11q) alone or with both 
del(11q) and an SF3B1 mutation. All three groups 
had significantly shorter times to initial treat-
ment than patients without an SF3B1 mutation 
or without del(11q) (Fig. 5B in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix) (P<0.001). Similarly, shorter times 
to initial treatment were observed among 3 pa-
tients in the extension cohort whose tumors 
harbored the SF3B1–K700E mutation as com-
pared with those whose tumors did not show 
this mutation. Because SF3B1 encodes a splicing 
factor that lies at the catalytic core of the splice­
osome, we looked for functional evidence of 
alterations in splicing associated with an SF3B1 
mutation. Kotake et al. previously used intron 
retention in the endogenous genes BRD2 and 
RIOK3 to test the function of the SF3b com-
plex.10 We confirmed that E7107, which targets 
this complex, inhibits the splicing of BRD2 and 
RIOK3 in both normal cells and chronic lym-
phocytic leukemia cells (Fig. 6A in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Using this assay, we found 
aberrant endogenous splicing activity in tumor 
samples from 13 patients with mutated SF3B1 
as compared with 17 patients with wild-type 
SF3B1, and the ratio of unspliced to spliced 
mRNA forms of BRD2 and RIOK3 was signifi-
cantly higher in patients with SF3B1 mutations 
(median ratio, 2.0:1 vs. 0.55:1 [P<0.001], and 
4.6:1 vs. 2.1:1 [P = 0.006], respectively) (Fig. 4B). 
In contrast, no splicing defects were detected in 
samples with the del(11q) defect and wild-type 
SF3B1 as compared with samples with the 
del(11q) defect and mutated SF3B1 (Fig. 6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). These studies indi-
cate that splicing function in chronic lympho-
cytic leukemia is altered as a result of a muta-
tion in SF3B1 rather than del(11q).
Discussion
Massively parallel sequencing technology has 
dramatically accelerated the discovery of genetic 
alterations in cancer.5,6,14 Our analysis of sam-
ples from 91 patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia provided the statistical power to iden-
tify the involvement of nine driver genes and to 
suggest the involvement of six distinct pathways 
in the pathogenesis of this disease. Moreover, we 
discovered novel associations with prognostic 
markers that shed light on the biology underly-
ing this clinically heterogeneous disease.
The data led us to several general conclu-
sions. First, like other hematologic cancers,14 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia has a lower rate 
of somatic mutation than most solid tumors.5,6 
Second, the rate of nonsynonymous mutation 
was not strongly affected by therapy. Third, in 
addition to finding the expected mutations in 
cell-cycle and DNA-repair pathways, we found 
Figure 2 (facing page). Core Signaling Pathways 
in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.
The nine genes with significant mutation frequencies 
fall into five core signaling pathways, in which the genes 
play well-established roles: DNA damage repair and cell-
cycle control (Panel A), Notch signaling (Panel B), in-
flammatory pathways (Panel C), Wnt signaling (Panel D), 
and RNA splicing and processing (Panel E). Genes with 
significant mutation frequencies are shown in red, and 
genes with mutations that are in a signaling pathway 
­related to chronic lymphocytic leukemia are shown in 
pink. A list of additional pathway-associated genes with 
mutations is provided in Table 6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix. Co-A denotes coenzyme A, TLR toll-like re-
ceptor, and TNFR tumor necrosis factor receptor.

genetic alterations in Notch signaling, inflam-
matory pathways, and RNA splicing and process-
ing. Fourth, driver mutations showed striking as-
sociations with standard prognostic markers, 
suggesting that particular combinations of genetic 
alterations may act in concert to drive cancer.

A major surprise was the finding that a core 
spliceosome component, SF3B1, was mutated in 
about 15% of the study patients. Further analysis 
revealed that samples with SF3B1 mutations had 
enhanced intron retention within two specific 
transcripts previously shown to be affected by 
compounds that disrupt SF3b spliceosome func-
tion.10,31 Studies of these compounds have sug-
gested that rather than inducing a global change 
in splicing, SF3b inhibitors alter the splicing of 
a narrow spectrum of transcripts derived from 
genes involved in cancer-related processes, in-
cluding cell-cycle control (p27, CCA2, STK6, and 
MDM2),31-33 angiogenesis, and apoptosis.34 Our 
results suggest that SF3B1 mutations lead to mis-
takes in the splicing of these and other specific 
transcripts that affect the pathogenesis of 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ongoing studies 
will focus on determining how mutations in 
SF3B1 alter its function in the processing of criti-
cal mRNAs.
Since mutations in SF3B1 are highly enriched 
in patients with del(11q), these mutations may 
be synergistic with loss of ATM, a hypothesis 
that is supported by the observation that two 
patients had point mutations in both ATM and 
SF3B1 but did not have del(11q). Providing fur-
ther support for this hypothesis, a recent unbi-
ased functional screen showed that core spliceo-
some components were required for DNA repair 
in mammalian cells.35
As illustrated by our findings regarding SF3B1
mutations, identification of coding mutations in 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia can lead to the 
development of mechanistic hypotheses, novel 
prognostic markers, and potential therapeutic

Samples from the 91 patients in the study were sorted by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), with the use of a model of 
hierarchical risk established by Döhner et al.3 Samples were scored for the presence or absence of mutations in the nine genes with sig-
nificant mutation frequencies (darker colors), as well as for mutations in additional pathway-associated genes (lighter colors) and in the 
immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) mutation status (blue indicates mutation, white no mutation, and hatched unknown sta-
tus). (A list of additional mutated pathway-associated genes is provided in Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix.) Associations be-
tween gene mutation status and FISH cytogenetic features or IGHV status were calculated with the use of Fisher’s exact test and cor-
rected for multiple hypothesis testing (Q≤0.1 for all comparisons shown).

starting point for the systematic analyses needed 
to address several fundamental questions con-
cerning chronic lymphocytic leukemia, includ-
ing which genes within chromosomal deletions 
and amplifications are essential, how each mu-
tation alters cellular networks and phenotypes, 
which combinations of mutations are critical in 
the development of cancer, and how genetic 
events in the host may affect the importance of 
specific mutations and their combinations.

Figure 4. Mutations in SF3B1 and Altered mRNA Splicing.
In Panel A, a Cox multivariable regression model de-
signed to test for clinical factors contributing to the need 
for earlier initiation of treatment showed that an SF3B1 
mutation was an independent predictor of a shorter time 
to treatment, regardless of the status of several other in-
dependent predictive markers. Panel B shows the rela-
tive amounts of spliced and unspliced spliceosome tar-
get messenger RNA (mRNA) in BRD2 and RIOK3 in 
normal CD19+ B cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
B cells with wild-type or mutated SF3B1, as measured by 
means of a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. 
The ratios of unspliced to spliced mRNA were normal-
ized to the percentage of leukemia cells per sample, and 
comparisons were calculated with the use of the Wilcox-
on rank-sum test. CI denotes confidence interval.
