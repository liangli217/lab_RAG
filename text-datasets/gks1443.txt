ABSTRACT
As
researchers
begin
probing
deep
coverage
sequencing data for increasingly rare mutations
and subclonal events, the fidelity of next generation
sequencing (NGS) laboratory methods will become
increasingly critical. Although error rates for seq-
uencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are
well documented, the effects that DNA extraction
and other library preparation steps could have on
downstream sequence integrity have not been thor-
oughly evaluated. Here, we describe the discovery
of novel C > A/G > T transversion artifacts found at
low
allelic
fractions
in
targeted
capture
data.
Characteristics such as sequencer read orientation
and presence in both tumor and normal samples
strongly indicated a non-biological mechanism. We
identified the source as oxidation of DNA during
acoustic shearing in samples containing reactive
contaminants
from
the
extraction
process.
We
show generation of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions
during DNA shearing, present analysis tools to
detect oxidation in sequencing data and suggest
methods to reduce DNA oxidation through the intro-
duction
of
antioxidants.
Further,
informatics
methods are presented to confidently filter these
artifacts from sequencing data sets. Though only
seen in a low percentage of reads in affected
samples,
such
artifacts
could
have
profoundly
deleterious effects on the ability to confidently call
rare
mutations,
and
eliminating
other
possible
sources of artifacts should become a priority for
the research community.
INTRODUCTION
Recent technical developments (1–4) and decreasing costs
have enabled cost effective deep sequencing coverage of
the gene-coding regions of the human genome across a
large number of samples. This ultra-deep coverage of the
human
exome
enables
researchers
to
push
beyond
previous biological limitations such as stromal admixture
or clonal heterogeneity to robustly detect somatic muta-
tions present in a lower fraction of the cells. Some recently
identiﬁed low allelic fraction events appear to play import-
ant roles in cancer initiation and progression (5–9),
indicating that routine characterization of these events
will become increasingly critical to the interpretation of
cancer genomes.
However, there are many challenges to the robust de-
tection of events present in only a few percentage of cells,
including, but not limited to algorithmic limitations,
sequencing errors, and sample
preparation artifacts.
Error rates for the Illumina HiSeq sequencer chemistry
are low and well understood (10) as is the sensitivity of

(NGS) sample preparation for both fragment end polish-
ing
(12)
and
PCR
(13–15)
have
been
thoroughly
characterized for ﬁdelity and error rate. However, it is
less well known how other common processes and
reagents used during DNA extraction and sample prepar-
ation might affect the ﬁdelity of downstream mutation
calling. A survey of the literature reveals that no studies
have been published to date, speciﬁcally examining the
effects that DNA extraction methods, storage conditions
or DNA fragmentation could have on the ﬁdelity of low
frequency mutation calling in NGS data. The possible
error rates of these processes are currently unknown.
Here, we describe the discovery and characterization of
a previously unreported source of artifactual mutations
occurring during the NGS sample preparation process.
We detail the analysis methods used to discover the
artifact
in
ultra-deep
coverage-targeted
capture
sequencing data and present novel sequence data metrics
that can be used to detect and measure these artifacts in
the primary analysis pipeline, before mutation calling. We
outline the experimental results, which elucidated the
source of the artifact as an oxidative mechanism during
high-powered DNA shearing and demonstrate detection
of abnormally high levels of the oxidation product 8-oxog
in affected samples following shearing. We also describe
recommended laboratory process changes that can be
readily adopted to reduce opportunities for oxidation in
the NGS sample preparation and propose analytical
methods for identifying and screening out obvious oxida-
tion artifacts already present in Illumina sequence data.
Finally, we discuss how such artifacts could adversely
affect the ability to identify true rare somatic mutations
and the impact that the discovery of process induced
artifacts could have on protocol development in the
NGS ﬁeld.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Illumina sequencing library preparation and Agilent
SureSelect targeted capture process
Automated Illumina DNA library construction was per-
formed as described by Fisher et al. (4) with the following
modiﬁcations: (i) initial genomic DNA input into shearing
was reduced from 3 mg to 100 ng in 50 ml and (ii) for
adapter ligation, Illumina paired-send adapters were
replaced with palindromic forked adapters with unique
eight base index sequences embedded within the adapter
to enable library multiplexing before sequencing. DNA
shearing too was performed on a Covaris E210 instrument
using standard crimp-cap AFA vessels. To achieve the
150-bp fragment size for targeted capture libraries, the
Covaris was programed with the following settings: 20%
duty cycle, intensity 5 and cycles per burst 200 for 165 s.
For 500-bp shearing for whole genome shotgun libraries,
the Covaris settings were as follows: 1% duty cycle, inten-
sity 5 and cycles per burst 200 for 300 s. Automated
targeted hybridization and capture was performed using
the Agilent SureSelect system also as described in Fisher
et al. (4).
Illumina cluster ampliﬁcation, sequencing and data
processing
Following sample preparation, libraries were quantiﬁed
using quantitative PCR with primers speciﬁc to the ends
of the Illumina adapters (KAPA Biosystems). Based on
qPCR quantiﬁcation, libraries were normalized to 2 nM
and then denatured using 0.1 N NaOH. Cluster ampliﬁca-
tion of denatured templates was performed according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina) using HiSeq 2000
v2, HiSeq v3 or MiSeq cluster chemistry and ﬂowcells.
HiSeq ﬂowcells were sequenced on HiSeq 2000 instru-
ments using HiSeq v2 or v3 Sequencing-by-Synthesis
Kits,
then
analysed
using
RTA
v1.10.15
or
RTA
v.1.12.4.2. MiSeq ﬂowcells were ampliﬁed and sequenced
on MiSeq instruments running Control Software v1.1.1
and analysed with the Illumina RTA v1.13 pipeline. For
pooled libraries prepared using forked, indexed adapters,
Illumina’s Multiplexing Sequencing Primer Kit was used,
and a third, 8-base sequencing read was performed to read
the 8-base molecular indices. Output from Illumina
software was processed by the Picard data-processing
pipeline to yield Binary Alignment Map (BAM) ﬁles con-
taining well-calibrated, aligned reads. The Artifact-Q
(ArtQ) script as described in the Results section was
then run on the annotated BAM ﬁles generated by Picard.
Sample preparation and sequencing on the Ion Torrent
Personal Genome Machine (PGM)
For this analysis, Ion Torrent libraries were created by
ligating Ion Torrent PGM paired-end adapters onto
already made Illumina libraries. Preparative Ion Sphere
templating and PGM sequencing was performed accord-
ing
to
manufacturer’s
recommended
protocols.
The
Illumina
adapter
sequence
was
trimmed
from
the
sequencing reads before alignment and artifact detection.
Sequence analysis and mutation calling
A detailed description of the sequence analysis methods
for Illumina data used here has been previously described
(16). Owing to low purity, genome complexity and
subclonal
mutations
found
in
cancer
samples,
this
analysis workﬂow is tuned to detect low allelic fraction
variants. Brieﬂy, sequencing reads were aligned to the
human genome reference GRCh37 (hg19) using bwa
(17),
quality
scores
recalibrated
using
the
Genome
Analysis Toolkit (11) and sequencing metrics calculated
using the Picard suite of tools (http://picard.sourceforge.
net). As additional quality controls, we ensured concord-
ance of the sequence data with 24 single nucleotide
polymorphisms
(SNPs)
independently
genotyped
by
mass
spectrometry
(Sequenom)
and
copy
number
proﬁles derived from an Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarray
run for each sample. Possible cross-contamination of
samples during library construction and sequencing was
scored using ConTest (18). Somatic substitutions and
indels were detected using muTect and IndelLocator, re-
spectively. All mutation calls were annotated using
Oncotator. These and other analysis tools are described
on our website, http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 8-oxog
The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was
obtained from Enzo Biosciences and contains a monoclo-
nal antibody speciﬁc for 8-oxog in extracted DNA. All
ELISA tests were run following the manufacturer’s rec-
ommended protocol with slight modiﬁcations: the amount
of primary anti-8-oxoG antibody used was increased by
15%, and primary antibody incubation time was also
increased to 2 h to improve sensitivity. For all ELISA ex-
periments, 200 ng of total DNA from each sample as
measured by Pico Green was used as input to the assay.
Calculation of 8-oxoG concentration against the provided
standard
was
performed
as
recommended
by
the
manufacturer.
Bead-based buffer exchange and antioxidant evaluation
Buffer

ing
a

magnetic bead clean up by adding 50 ul of Ampure XP
beads (Beckman Genomics) to 50 ul of DNA and follow-
ing the standard manufacturer protocol. Following SPRI
clean up genomic DNA samples were eluted in 50 ul of
antioxidant
buffers
or
in
10 mM
Tris–HCl
alone.
Antioxidant
agents
ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid
(EDTA), deforoxamine mesylate (DFAM) and butylated
hydroxytoluene
(BHT)
were
obtained
from
Sigma-Aldrich. For stock solutions, EDTA and DFAM
were both dissolved in water and BHT in ethanol per
manufacturer’s recommendations. Final concentrations
of 1 mM EDTA, 100 uM DFAM and 100 uM BHT were
added to the standard 10 mM Tris–HCl alone, in pairs,
and all three together (see Results).
RESULTS
Discovery and initial characterization of a low allelic
fraction artifact
In a deep coverage exome study of 221 tumors and
matched normal tissues from melanoma, we observed an
unexpectedly high number of variants at allelic fractions
<20% (Figure 1). These variants were not consistent with
the expected dominance of C > T transitions in melanoma
owing to ultraviolet damage as previously reported
(19,20). Instead, the analysis uncovered thousands of
apparent C > A/G > T variants in these samples with a
speciﬁc sequence context of CCG > CAG, and most strik-
ingly were not restricted to tumor material. They were also
found at a similarly high rate when mutation calling was
reversed to call ‘variants’ off the normal using the tumor
as the reference, further indicating these base changes were
likely not due to a disease mechanism (Figure 2). Further,
we noted that the artifacts had a speciﬁc strand orienta-
tion in that G > T errors always presented in the ﬁrst
Illumina HiSeq instrument read, whereas the C > A
errors were always found in the second HiSeq read.
Lastly, these variants were not supported by matching
RNA sequence data obtained from either the tumor or
normal DNA of affected samples (data not shown).
Closer inspection of deep coverage exome data from
other cancer types also uncovered these same C > A/
G > T transversions at low allelic fractions in subsets of
samples, including cancers with known lower mutation
rates such as neuroblastoma (21,22) and chronic lympho-
cytic leukemia (23–25) (data not shown). Combined, these
characteristics led us to believe that these variants were
not biological in nature. Rather, we hypothesized that
these base changes were caused by some artifact induced
in the sample collection, extraction, library preparation or
sequencing processes.

region are the 4  4 combinations of possible preceding (50) or trailing
(30) bases as labeled in the grid at the lower right. At allele fractions
<10%, the CCG > CAG mutation dominates all other variants.

To better understand the full scope of the artifact’s
presence in exome data, we developed a sensitive and
accurate metric using the unique context, strand speciﬁcity
and read orientation characteristics of the artefact that
could quickly process large data sets to measure the rate
of C > A/G > T artifacts. We started by looking at all high
quality (>Q20) base observations at C/G sites in the
genome and classifying them into the following: (i) refer-
ence basecalls; (ii) alternative basecalls (A/T) that are con-
sistent with the artifact characteristics; (iii) alternative
basecalls (A/T) that are inconsistent with the artifact char-
acteristics; and (iv) all other bases. As in aggregate there
should be no correlated bias between C > A and G > T
error modes and instrument read order for true biological
variation, we assume that the errors from sources other
than that of the artifact should be symmetric and arrive at
the following deﬁnition of ArtQ:
10  log10 consistent errors  inconsistent errors=
ð
all observationsÞ
This yields a phred scaled error rate attributable to
G > T/A > C transversions with the speciﬁc artifact char-
acteristics we had observed in our data. An ArtQ score
>30 means that less than 1 in a thousand bases are attrib-
utable to artifact error. For the purposes of our analysis,
we considered a sample with an ArtQ score >30 to be
‘unaffected’ by this artifact.

high rate in this set of neuroblastoma samples when mutation calling was ﬂipped to call variants off normal samples using the matched tumors as a

Determining the origin of the artifact
We calculated the ArtQ metric for nearly all human
targeted capture and whole genome projects sequenced
at our institute since 2009, encompassing >50 000 libraries
from hundreds of different initiatives and disease projects
(Figure 3). Immediately, it became clear that the preva-
lence of the artifact, though always there, had increased in
frequency during the previous year, and that there was a
large amount of project-to-project variation in the artifact
prevalence (see Discussion). We began to investigate
possible sources of error in the laboratory, and we were
ﬁrst able to rule out that the Illumina HiSeq and cluster
ampliﬁcation chemistry was not inducing these base
changes by sequencing the same affected libraries on
Illumina HiSeq V2, V3 and MiSeq chemistries, as well
as on Life Technologies Ion Torrent PGM chemistry.
The Illumina sequencing versions tested generated no
signiﬁcant differences in ArtQ scores for each library
(Table 1). Although ArtQ scores could not be calculated
in the same fashion for Ion data owing to the lack of
pairing information, C > A base changes found in the
samples at given base positions in Illumina data were
also found in Ion PGM data for each library tested
(data not shown). These observations strongly indicated
that the base changes had occurred before the sequencing
step.
We then observed that whole genome samples con-
tained little to no evidence of signiﬁcant artifactual
C > A/G > T
transversions
compared
with
targeted
capture
samples
processed
during
the
same
period
(Supplementary Figure S1). This ﬁnding then led us to
investigate our automated SureSelect targeted enrichment
process itself. We sequenced a pool of 370 pre-exome en-
richment libraries along with their 370 corresponding
post-exome enrichment captured libraries. We found
that for all samples, the ArtQ scores for both were

the artifact source.

highly correlated (Figure 4), indicating that the base
changes were already been induced upstream of targeted
capture. Because we had streamlined our laboratory
processes, the production protocols used to create libraries
destined for either targeted capture or whole genome pro-
cessing were nearly identical. The one exception was the
acoustic shearing protocol used to fragment the DNA for
either the exome process (a high powered 150-bp fragmen-
tation) or whole genome (a lower powered 500-bp frag-
mentation) (see Methods).
To determine whether the 150-bp shearing protocol
could be introducing the C > A/G > T artifacts, we took
DNA samples that when sequenced previously had low
ArtQ scores and made new 150 bp and 500 bp libraries.
All other steps in the library preparation protocol were
kept the same, and the libraries were sequenced immedi-
ately after PCR without any further processing or size
selection steps. The sequencing results show a clear and
signiﬁcant increase in the prevalence of the artifact, as
measured by ArtQ, when the same samples were sheared
using the 150-bp protocol as compared with the 500-bp
protocol (Figure 5). These data provided the ﬁrst proof
that a major contributing source of the artifact was the
higher powered 150-bp acoustic shearing protocol used to
create these targeted capture libraries.
Interaction of shearing protocol with incoming genomic
sample quality
Although the 150-bp shearing step was demonstrated to
induce these artifacts, we saw that less than a half of all
exome samples receiving that 150-bp shearing protocol
were signiﬁcantly affected (Figure 3), and for samples
that traveled together on 96-well plates throughout the
entire process, often only a subset of samples would be
affected. Moreover, as described in the previous section,
we consistently observed that new sequencing libraries
made from the same source DNA as a previously
affected library were also highly affected at similar ArtQ
scores. Taken together, these observations strongly sug-
gested that the 150-bp shearing protocol alone was not
sufﬁcient to cause the artifact. Rather, some inherent
property of the incoming sample made it more or less
susceptible to damage during the 150-bp shearing process.
Within and between each disease project, the rate of
artifact prevalence varied widely without any immediately
obvious patterns or correlations (Figure 6). However, for
a given disease project, we often receive pre-extracted
Figure 4. ArtQ for Pre- versus Post-targeted capture. For a set of 370 samples, both the pre- and post-exome enrichment libraries were sequenced.
ArtQ was well correlated (R2= 0.9957), indicating that the artifactual base changes had already been introduced before exome capture.

Average ArtQ scores post-sequencing for the same set of six samples
sheared with using both 150-bp and 500-bp Covaris protocols. The
150-bp shear protocol had signiﬁcantly lower ArtQ values (P < 0.05)
than the 500 bp for all samples tested.

DNA samples from multiple collaborators or institutions,
which we term as separate ‘collection sites’ within a
project. These separate laboratories do not necessarily
use the same DNA extraction or handling methods. By
further separating disease projects into their constituent
collections, we observed that the artifact’s prevalence
was clustering by DNA collection site (Figure 6). This
ﬁnding added credence to our hypothesis that varied
upstream extraction methods may be causing a subset of
incoming samples to be more susceptible to artifact gen-
eration during shearing.
Conﬁrmation of DNA oxidation mediated mutation during
DNA shearing
We next set out to determine the molecular basis for these
artifacts.
The
fact
that
these
were
C > A/G > T
transversions and that they occur most frequently in the
context of CCG ! CAG led us to hypothesis that the
cause was oxidation of DNA, speciﬁcally the conversion
of guanine to 8-oxoG. 8-oxoG is a common lesion in
DNA generated via oxidation, and it is known to pair
with both cytosine and adenosine during PCR leading to
C > A/G > T transversions (26,27). Oxidation of guanine
to 8-oxogG has also been demonstrated to exhibit a
distinct sequence context preference (28–30) in which the
likelihood of a base being targeted for oxidation is highly
dependent on both the 50 and 30 bases surrounding it, with
the CCG/GGC we observed here being the context with
the highest oxidation potential in demonstrated in these
previous studies. Oxidation of DNA can come from a
variety of commonly encountered sources, including
DNA extraction methods, long-term storage of DNA in
aqueous buffers, heat, exposure to trace metals and son-
ication (31–37). During the 150-bp shearing protocol, we
observed that the contents of the shearing tube increased
in temperature from 10C to 30C, despite being
submerged in a 10C water bath. Conversely, the tempera-
ture did not increase during 500-bp shear protocol.
The
presence
of
both
powerful
acoustic
sonication
energy and heat accumulation provided further indica-
tions that the 150-bp shearing protocol could be oxidizing
DNA.
To conﬁrm the presence of 8-oxog in affected samples,
we performed an 8-oxoG speciﬁc ELISA assay (Enzo
Biosciences) on remaining DNA from six melanoma that
were highly affected in previous sequencing (ArtQ < 20)
and
six
samples
that
were
relatively
unaffected
(ArtQ > 30). Each sample was split in three equal aliquots
and sheared with the 150-bp protocol, 500-bp protocol or
left unsheared and then assayed via ELISA (Figure 7a).
The results clearly show signiﬁcantly elevated levels of
8-oxoG (P < 0.05) were present only in the previously
highly affected melanoma samples when sheared with
the 150-bp shearing protocol. The levels of 8-oxoG
generated following the lower powered 500-bp shear
were not signiﬁcant even in known susceptible samples,
which was consistent with previous observations of
lower
artifact
prevalence
in
500-bp
whole
genome
samples.
The
difference
in
8-oxoG
levels
between
affected and unaffected samples further conﬁrmed that
shearing alone is not enough to induce oxidation, but
that there was some contaminant in some samples that
leads to increased oxidation activity during shearing. To
conﬁrm this, we compared 8-oxoG levels on samples
sheared with or without buffer exchange using Ampure
XP SPRI beads (Figure 7b). The results show a signiﬁcant
decrease (P < 0.05) in the presence of 8-oxog in the
samples that underwent buffer exchange, further conﬁrm-
ing that there were contaminants in the DNA buffers that
were contributing to oxidation.
These ELISA results provided conﬁrmation for the
shearing-induced oxidation hypothesis and demonstrated
that affected DNA samples contain some contaminants in
their source buffers that when exposed to the strong
acoustic energy and/or heat generated during the 150-bp
shear create
a highly
oxidative
environment.

and automation used during the targeted capture preparation process. For a subset of six projects shown here receiving DNA from multiple
collection sites using various extraction methods, the prevalence of the artifact was also variable from site to site within the same project.
All projects shown consist of >100 samples; all sites listed contributed at least 12 samples to their respective project.

8-oxoG bases then persist throughout the NGS protocol
to the PCR enrichment step, where the C > A and G > T
base changes occur owing to Hoogsteen base pairing of
8-oxoG and A (27). In addition, this mechanism ﬁts with
the sequencer read speciﬁcity we observed in our data: the
G > T base change is always observed on the read 1
strand, and the C > A is always on the opposite read 2
strand. If the artifact is being induced in shearing, this is
before ligation of the forked Illumina adapters. Because of
the nature of these palindromic adapters and subsequent
PCR reaction mechanics, the original DNA strands con-
taining the 8-oxoG lesion containing the G > T error will
always end up on the read 1 side of the ﬁnal library
fragment, and the strand generated during PCR enrich-
ment (containing the C > A error) will be read during read
2 (Supplementary Figure S2).
Development of methods to reduce DNA oxidation during
shearing
We next explored the addition of antioxidants to samples
before shearing as an attempt to both rescue susceptible
samples and also gain insight into the reaction mechanism.
Additives tested included two metal chelators, 1 mM
EDTA and 100 uM DFAM, and a phenolic antioxidant
and
free
radical
scavenger,
100 uM
BHT
(38,39).
Susceptible
melanoma
sample
material
(previous
ArtQ = 22) was diluted in triplicate in our standard
10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8 buffer without or with these addi-
tives, alone and in combination, before 150-bp shearing
(see Materials and Methods). Following standard library
construction and sequencing, the ArtQ metrics were used
to determine the effectiveness of each additive or combin-
ation of additives at preventing the oxidation artifact
(Figure 8, bottom pane). The results of this experiment
demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in oxidation artifacts
as measured by ArtQ for samples when either of the che-
lators, EDTA or DFAM was included in the shearing
buffer. The hydroxyl radical scavenger BHT appeared to
have little protective effect. The success of the chelators
strongly suggests that some form of metal ions present in
samples after DNA extraction may be involved in the oxi-
dation mechanism during shearing. However, as DFAM
signiﬁcantly reduced yields from our library construction
process (Figure 8, top), only EDTA showed a clear beneﬁt
without risking, reducing the robustness of our library
preparation process.
These results in combination with the results from the
previously described buffer exchange experiments have
allowed us to develop a protocol to protect DNA from
oxidation during shearing. All incoming DNA samples are

buffer exchanged into Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer (10 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA) as a preventative measure to remove
any possible contaminants present in the source buffer and
to add EDTA to protect against shearing induced oxida-
tion. Although metal-catalysed oxidation appears to be
the primary mechanism of artifact induction for this par-
ticular subset of samples tested, it is highly likely that
other
oxidation
mechanisms
could
exist.
We
are
continuing to evaluate more samples from a wider
variety of sources and extraction methods, as addition of
metal chelation with EDTA may not be a cure all for
shearing induced oxidation in all samples.
Development of a ﬁlter-based method for removing
oxidation artifacts from sequencing data during mutation
calling
The
presence
of
these
artifactual
C > A/G > T
transversions in sequencing data could lead to obvious
issues in somatic mutation calling. Reprocessing the
samples with low ArtQ scores through library prepar-
ation using the previously detailed laboratory process
improvements is preferred, but for affected data sets
that cannot be reprocessed in the laboratory, we have de-
veloped a post-processing ﬁltering method that can be
used
to
screen
out
oxidation-induced
artifacts
in
sequencing data with high conﬁdence to improve the
ﬁdelity of mutation calling at low allelic fractions. As
the artifact was originally found at low allelic frac-
tions, we have discovered that a universal threshold
cannot be applied to throw out possible artifacts, as
bona ﬁde somatic mutations can be found at similar or
even lower allele fractions. In particular, in high mutation
rate tumors such as lung adenocarcinomas C > A artifacts
are likely to co-mingle with previously characterized
smoking-induced
C > A
mutations
(Supplementary
Figure S3) (40,41).
Mutation calls from the program used here, MuTect
(Cibulskis
et
al.
in
preparation,
http://conﬂuence.
broadinstitute.org/display/CGATools/Home),
depend
on well-calibrated base qualities to distinguish real muta-
tions from sequencing errors, but in the case of the
CCG > CAG artifacts reported here, the base qualities
do not reﬂect the probability that a non-reference base
call is the result of a true mutation. As MuTect already
applies post-processing ﬁlters to remove various types of
previously known sequencing artifacts from the ﬁnal list of
somatic point mutations, we designed a new ﬁlter to spe-
ciﬁcally remove CCG > CAG oxidation artifacts based on
their unique properties that are inconsistent with real mu-
tations including the base context, sequencing read orien-
tation and characteristic low allelic fraction prevalence.
Artifact base changes are seen as G > T only in read 1
and C > A only in read 2 as previously described, which
we represent in the ﬁlter as the fraction of alternate allele
supporting reads comprising G > T changes on read 1 and
C > A changes on read (‘FoxoG’). Artifactual base
changes should have high FoxoG ratios as compared
with real somatic C > A mutations that are not read orien-
tation speciﬁc. To determine the FoxoG value for the non-
C > A or G > T mutations, we adopted a convention that
‘A’ and ‘G’ alternate alleles on read 2 and ‘C’ and ‘T’
alternate alleles on read 1 are counted in the numerator
of the FoxoG value. To capture the characteristic low
allele fraction of 8-oxoG artifact for purposes of artifact
ﬁltering, we quantiﬁed this property in terms of the
MuTect ‘tumor_lod’ score, which is the estimated log
odds that the observed number of alternate allele reads
from the tumor sample could have arisen from a reference
allele. The ﬁlter therefore takes into account both the
FoxoG and tumor_lod measures to determine whether
C > A base changes are most likely artifactual in nature
and should be excluded.
To train the ﬁlter, we used a set of 31 samples from
seven different tumor types prepared and sequenced at
different
periods
during
2011
and
early
2012
(Supplementary
Table
S1).
Here,
we
deﬁned
‘full’
context mutations as C > A base changes in the context
of
both
a
proceeding
C
and
a
trailing
G
base
(CCG > CAG). ‘Partial’ context mutations are deﬁned as
having either a preceding C or a trailing G, but not both
(NCG > NAG or CCN > CAN), and ‘no’ context C > A
mutations lack both the preceding C and trailing G bases.
All non- C > A or G > T mutations served as a null
model for non-oxidation-induced base changes. Two-
dimensional histograms of FoxoG versus the tumor_lod
for C > A and G > T mutations at each of the three levels
of sequence context (Figure 9) showed an excess enrich-
ment for high FoxoG and low tumor_lod mutations
(lower right corner area of plots) as compared with the
non- C > A or G > T mutation distribution. As expected,
the proportion of artifact prevalence increased with
sequence context speciﬁcity from ‘No’ to ‘Partial’ to
‘Full’ as the oxidation potential of the G base in
question increased. Based on the distribution of context-
speciﬁc low allelic fraction and high FoxoG C > A/G > T
mutations seen in the training set, we determined the ﬁlter
threshold to be applied (represented by the dashed line in
the plots) to be the following: tumor_lod > 10+(100/3)
FoxoG. Once applied, the ﬁlter was able to successfully
eliminate the excess number of CCG > CAG mutations
that demonstrated artifactual characteristics (Figure 9b).
Using the null model from non- C > A or G > T muta-
tions, we estimated that the fraction of true biological
C > A mutations removed by the ﬁlter was only 1.4%
(1.2–1.6%,
95%
conﬁdence
interval),
whereas
the
fraction of passed mutations that could be attributed
to oxidation artifacts was reduced to 0.1% (0–1.6%,
95% conﬁdence interval) in this test set. Application of
this ﬁlter to MuTect mutation calls therefore removed
nearly all artifactual C > A mutations with high speciﬁ-
city, high conﬁdence and a low chance of false positive
mutation calls attributed to oxidative base changes in
shearing.
DISCUSSION
This discovery of a previously unreported mechanism of
DNA damage inﬂicted during common sample prepar-
ation methods that can lead to anomalous base changes
has an obvious and considerable impact on downstream

data analysis. Although many projects such as medical or
population genetics studies may not be looking at highly
rare events, an increasing number of recent cancer projects
have focused on attempting to detect extremely low fre-
quency variants at the lowest allelic fractions. In the past
year, publications have emerged detailing NGS methods
for mutation calling at 0.1% allelic fraction (42), detection
of circulating tumor cell DNA in human blood extracts
(43) and single cell whole exome sequencing of human
kidney tumor cells to understand tumor genetic heterogen-
eity (44). Outside of cancer, other groups have published
work detailing sequencing methods for non-invasive
analysis
of
chromosomal
abnormalities
from
free
circulating fetal cells in the mother’s blood (45,46). The
introduction of artifacts at low allelic fractions like those
described here could certainly derail the accuracy and
limit of detection of such projects. Although we describe
an oxidation-speciﬁc artifact induced in our high-powered
acoustic shearing protocol, many laboratories use similar
DNA fragmentation methods as used in our laboratory,
and further, there are likely other mechanisms for both
oxidation and non-oxidation-mediated base changes that
still need to be discovered. This discovery therefore has
broad implications for all NGS laboratories.
Vendors and research institutions alike have been
focusing much effort in the past few years on the reduction
of DNA input requirements for the library construction
process. Yet, as we continue to reduce inputs, the effects of
random stochastic damage events such as the oxidation
mechanism described here are likely to be ampliﬁed. In
looking at our data for this particular transversion, we
observed that this phenomenon did in fact worsen pro-
gressively over time, as we reduced our input into the
exome
process
from
3 ug
to
100 ng
(Figure
3).

(the fraction of alternate allele reads in the oxoG artifact conﬁguration, horizontal axis) and Tumor_lod (log odds that the mutation could arise from

the count of mutations in a bin. The ‘non-C>A,G>T’ data serves as a null model (non-OxoG artifact). The proportion of non-artifact depends on
sequence context, but the region dominated by OxoG in the lower right corner below the dotted line is consistent across contexts. Each panel is
labeled with the fraction of mutations below the threshold, although in the case of the ‘non-C>A,G>T’ data, all mutations including those under the
cut line, are passed by the ﬁlter. (b) Before (left) and after (right) application of the OxoG ﬁlter in MuTect in the set of 31 samples from a variety of

are different owing to the excess of C > A artifacts in the unﬁltered data.

Considering our model of shearing-induced base damage,
it makes sense that reducing the DNA input into the
shearing vessel by 30-fold but maintaining the intensity
of the acoustic power applied to each sample led to the
effect being ampliﬁed. As groups go even lower with input
requirements and single cell technologies begin to take off,
the way we examine the data produced while developing
these protocols needs to be rethought to detect these types
of random stochastic molecular changes.
Further, the effects that upstream sample acquisition,
nucleic acid extraction and sample storage techniques can
have on DNA base composition and ﬁdelity of down-
stream single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) calling
are still not well understood. We are now implementing
a best practice approach of performing a buffer exchange
of all incoming samples to reduce the risk of oxidative
agents damaging DNA during shearing. Although we
observed protection from oxidation with the addition
metal chelators, we still do not know the exact identity
of these contaminants that make some DNA samples
more susceptible to oxidation than others. To help
provide answers, we are currently devising experiments
to identifying these agents by methods such as mass
spectroscopy or high pressure (or high performance)
liquid chromatography in hopes to design more targeted
methods to counteract oxidation and provide valuable in-
formation that can be used to develop safer methods of
DNA extraction.
Finally, the discovery of this particular oxidation-driven
error mechanism has led us to think on a much larger scale
about other non-biological base substitutions that may be
lurking in sequencing data. The obvious deleterious effects
that the existence of such artifacts can have on the ﬁeld of
cancer research could be dramatic. If multiple common
processes in the laboratory can signiﬁcantly alter the
physical base sequence of DNA, it begs the question of
whether we can truly be conﬁdent that the rare mutations
we are searching for can actually be attributed to true
biological variation. We have invested much time and
effort into characterizing this one particular oxidation
mediated event, but this is one of the myriad of possible
low frequency errors that could be induced during NGS
sample preparation. The discovery of this oxidation-
induced artifact in NGS sample preparation demonstrated
that the development of new protocols for NGS sample
preparation can lead to changes in to DNA at a molecular
and chemical level that may be subtle and difﬁcult (if not
impossible) to see with conventional sequence quality
measures. A systematic review of a wide variety of data
obtained
using
different
protocols
from
different
laboratories needs to be undertaken by the sequencing
community to identify whether there are any types of
other artifacts that may be induced during extraction
and/or
library
preparation
that
could
be
wrongly
attributed to the biology of a given disease.
