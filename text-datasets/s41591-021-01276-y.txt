Single-cell RNA sequencing: one step closer to 
the clinic
Single-cell RNA-sequencing can help in the prediction of drug resistance in patients with multiple myeloma.

M
ultiple myeloma (MM), 
the second-most-common 
hematological malignancy 
in the USA, comprises an 
immunoglobulin-secreting plasma-cell 
tumor that resides in the bone marrow 
and can lead to permanent organ 
damage and death1. Despite substantial 
contributions by a highly active and 
devoted research community, MM remains 
a deadly disease, partly due to its marked 
genetic heterogeneity that complicates 
the discovery of universal biomarkers 
and the development of ‘one-size-fits-all’ 
therapy2. Although considerable advances 
in MM therapeutics have improved patient 
outcomes in recent years3–5, a major clinical 
hurdle in curing this deadly and debilitating 
disease has been that most patients with 
MM eventually develop drug resistance  
and relapse6,7. It is therefore imperative  
to develop methods that can be used to 
predict resistance to treatment  
and alternative therapeutic options that 
prevent or circumvent the development 
of resistance. Now, in Nature Medicine, 
Cohen et al. report that single-cell RNA 
sequencing can be applied to patients’ 
samples in the context of a clinical trial to 
help in the prediction of resistance and to 
guide therapeutic development to resensitize 
tumors to drugs8.
In the study, the authors used single-cell 
RNA sequencing on bone-marrow samples 
from patients with primary refractory 
MM (PRMM) enrolled in the KYDAR 
trial (a single-arm prospective trial of 
daratumumab, carfilzomib, lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone (DARA-KRD)). 
Specifically, they performed MARS-seq 
(massively parallel single-cell RNA 
sequencing) on samples from a cohort  
of 41 patients with PRMM who either  
did not respond within the first 6 months  
of therapy or progressed early during  
the first 18 months of first-line treatment. 
Serial samples were obtained from some  
of these patients during treatment  
(cycles 4 and 10).
Comparing gene expression in tumor 
cells from patients with PRMM versus 
that in cells from healthy people, the 
authors identified an expression signature 
(module 1) that was upregulated in a subset 
of patients with PRMM. That module 
comprises genes encoding proteins related to

endoplasmic reticulum stress, the unfolded 
protein response, and the proteasome 
pathway, all of which are pathways relevant 
to resistance to first-line proteasome 
inhibitors.
Notably, the authors found that 
this transcriptional signature was an 
independent risk factor of both progression 
(progression-free survival) and death 
(overall survival) in the KYDAR trial and in 
an independent sample from the CoMMpass 
study, a cohort of ~1,000 patients with newly 
diagnosed MM for whom tumor DNA and 
bulk RNA-sequencing data are available9. 
These findings suggest that module 1 
captures a resistance risk that is distinct 
from that captured by standard clinical 
risk-stratification systems. In fact, there is 
substantial overlap between module 1 and a 
DARA-KRD-resistance signature (generated 
by comparison of patients with PRMM who 
responded to DARA-KRD versus those who 
did not), which suggests that this resistance 
signature may be active and relevant 
throughout the course of several lines  
of treatment.
Next, to explore if the resistance signature 
could be used in clinics, in a prospective 
manner, the authors developed a model 
that can be applied to patients at baseline 
to predict their response to DARA-KRD. 
Although this model would be relevant for 
the ~30% of patients who already harbor 
resistant clones at baseline, it may also be 
relevant for the ~40% of patients that have 
small malignant clones that are undetectable 
or non-existent at baseline but drive 
progression through treatment selection and 
evolution. For such cases, by dynamically 
monitoring resistance in serial samples from 
the KYDAR trial, this approach identified 
resistant clones that appeared during 
treatment. This result suggests that dynamic 
monitoring of resistance while a patient is 
being treated may allow the early detection 
of an upcoming relapse, driven by small 
resistant clones.
While the use of gene-expression 
profiling for risk-stratification purposes 
has been previously applied to MM10, 
the importance and novelty of this 
study lie in the concurrent profiling of 
tumor clonotypes with rearrangement of 
variable-diversity-joining regions (which 
serve as each tumor’s unique identity 
tag11,12) and transcriptomes. In contrast to 
the profiling of tumors in bulk, single-cell 
sequencing approaches can differentiate 
among clones within the same tumor, which 
may or may not diverge substantially in 
their drug-resistance capacity. Therefore, 
this approach allows predictive scoring of 
individual clones in every tumor and thus 
may reveal smaller clones, some of which are 
predicted to be resistant, even though the 
majority of tumor cells may be sensitive to 
therapy. Such cases would presumably evolve 
under treatment and may need a different 
regimen to achieve durable remissions. If 
assessed in bulk, this signal would be diluted 
across all clones, which would perhaps make 
it undetectable, depending on the resistant 
clone’s size. Furthermore, this approach 
also enables the detection of small resistant 
clones that appear while the patient is being 
treated. This is particularly interesting, as 
it underscores the utility of this method for 
both profiling patients before treatment 
initiation and dynamically assessing 
responses while they are being treated.
In the end, will this study change  
clinical practice? And if not, what is  
required for change? At present, single-cell 
RNA sequencing is still too expensive  
to be applied clinically as part of 
standard-of-care treatment, and using 
it to dynamically assess response in 
patients with MM would require serial 
bone-marrow biopsies, which are too 
invasive to be allowed. Furthermore, the 
resistance signature discovered in this study 
is unlikely to be relevant for every regimen 
and every patient. For example, although 
this signature seems to be an important 
predictor of resistance to proteasome 
inhibitors, it was present in only ~5% of 
newly diagnosed cases in the CoMMpass 
cohort. Other alterations (e.g., mutations 
in CRBN, which encodes cereblon) may be 
important for resistance to lenalidomide 
or other drugs13. Although this study is 
not expected to change clinical practice 
just yet, it does offer a blueprint for the 
development of a drug-resistance atlas that 
may indeed change clinical practice in the 
future. For this vision to become a reality, 
more whole-genome sequencing, single-cell 
RNA sequencing and/or sequencing of 
variable-diversity-joining regions, as well 
as proteomics, will need to be performed 
on patients being treated with different 
regimens. Larger longitudinal cohorts are 
needed in order to design comprehensive 
resistance tests that may need to span 
DNA, RNA and protein levels. By the time 
this vision is achieved, clinical single-cell 
sequencing may be feasible.
