A powerful way to discover key genes with causal roles in oncogenesis is to identify genomic regions that undergo frequent
alteration in human cancers. Here we present high-resolution analyses of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) from
3,131 cancer specimens, belonging largely to 26 histological types. We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at
significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target
gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2
family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-kB pathway. We show that cancer cells containing amplifications surrounding the
MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend on the expression of these genes for survival. Finally, we demonstrate that a
large majority of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are present in several cancer types.
The development of cancer is driven by the acquisition of somatic
genetic alterations, including single base substitutions, transloca-
tions, infections, and copy-number alterations1,2. Recent advances
in genome characterization technologies have enabled increasingly
systematic efforts to characterize these alterations in human cancer
samples3. Identification of these genome alterations can provide
important insights into the cellular defects that cause cancer and
suggest potential therapeutic strategies2.
Somaticcopy-numberalterations(SCNAs,distinguishedfromgerm-
line copy-number variations, CNVs; see Supplementary Note 1a)
are extremely common in cancer4–6. Genomic analyses of cancer
samples, by cytogenetic studies and more recently by array-based
profiling, have identified recurrent alterations associated with par-
ticular cancer types4–6. In some cases, focal SCNAs have led to the
identification of cancer-causing genes and suggested specific thera-
peutic approaches7–14.
A critical challenge in the genome-wide analysis of SCNAs is distin-
guishing the alterations that drive cancer growth from the numerous,
apparently random alterations that accumulate during tumorigenesis
(see Supplementary Note 1b). By studying a sufficiently large collection
of cancer samples, it should ultimately be possible to create a com-
prehensive, high-resolution catalogue of all SCNAs consistently assoc-
iated with the development of all major types of cancer. Key open
questions include: the extent to which significant SCNAs are associated
withknowncancer-relatedgenesorindicatethepresenceofnewcancer-
related genes in particular cancer types; theextent to which largesample
collections can be used to pinpoint the precise ‘targets’ of recurrent
amplifications or deletions and thereby to identify cancer-related genes

(see Supplementary Note 2); and the extent to which SCNAs are
restricted to particular types or shared across many cancer types, sug-
gesting common biological pathways.
In this paper, we explore these issues by studying copy-number
profiles from 3,131 cancers across more than two dozen cancer types,
with the data all derived from a single experimental platform and
analysed with a common, rigorous statistical methodology.
A collection of 3,131 copy-number profiles across cancer
The 3,131 cancer copy-number profiles consisted of 2,509 profiles
determined by our laboratory (see references in Supplementary
Note 3), including more than 800 previously unpublished profiles,
and 622profiles determined by other groups11,15,16. Most (2,965) come
from 26 cancer types, each represented by more than 20 specimens.
Seventeen cancer types are represented by at least 40 specimens each
(Supplementary Table 1). Most profiles (2,520) were obtained from
tissue specimens, with the remainder from cancer cell lines (541) and
melanoma short-term cultures (70).
Copy-number measurements were obtained on the Affymetrix
250 K Sty array, containing probes for 238,270 single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs). We compared the signal intensities from each
cancer specimen to array data from 1,480 normal tissue specimens
(of which 1,140 were paired with cancer specimens from the same
individual) to identify regions of somatically generated SCNA. We
recorded the genomic position, length and amplitude of change in
normalizedcopy-numberforevery SCNA (SupplementaryFig. 1aand
Supplementary Methods).
We observed a total of 75,700 gains and 55,101 losses across the
3,131 cancers, for a mean of 24 gains (median 5 12) and 18 losses
(median 5 12) per sample. For most (17 out of 26) cancer types, the
mean number of SCNAs per sample was within twofold of these
overall means (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Across all samples, 8.3% of
amplification and 8.7% of deletion breakpoints (excluding those
occurring within centromeres or telomeres) occurred in regions of
segmental duplication, which is enriched relative to the proportion of
the genome in such regions (5.1% of SNPs; P , 10220 in each case)
and probably reflects a predisposition to SCNA formation17. An
average of 17% of the genome was amplified and 16% deleted in a
typical cancer sample, compared to averages of 0.35% and less than
0.1% in normal samples (representing germline CNVs and occa-
sional analytic artefacts).
Background rates of focal and arm-level SCNAs
Across the entire genome, the most prevalent SCNAs are either very
short (focal) or almost exactly the length of a chromosome arm or
whole chromosome (arm-level) (Fig. 1a). The focal SCNAs occur at a

frequency inversely related to their lengths, with a median length of
1.8 megabases (Mb) (range 0.5 kilobases (kb)–85 Mb).
Arm-level SCNAs occur approximately 30 times more frequently
than would be expected by the inverse-length distribution associated
with focal SCNAs (Fig. 1a). This observation is seen across all cancer
types (Supplementary Fig. 2), and applies to both copy gains and
losses (data not shown). As a result, in a typical cancer sample, 25% of
the genome is affected by arm-level SCNAs and 10% by focal SCNAs,
with 2% overlap. All arm-level (and most focal) SCNAs are of low
amplitude (usually single-copy changes), but some focal SCNAs can
range to very high amplitude. When analysing SCNAs for evidence of
significant alteration in cancer, we accounted for the difference in
background rates between arm-level and focal SCNAs by considering
them separately.
Several studies have analysed patterns of arm-level SCNAs across
large numbers of cancer specimens4–6, and our results are mainly in
agreement with theirs. We also observed that the frequency of arm-
level SCNAs decreases with the length of chromosome arms. Adjusted
for this trend, most chromosome arms show strong evidence of pref-
erential gain or loss, but rarely both, across many cancer lineages (see
Fig. 1b and Supplementary Note 4).
The large size of arm-level SCNAs makes it difficult to determine
the specific target gene or genes. By contrast, mapping of focal SCNAs
has great power to pinpoint the important genes targeted by these
events7–14.
Pooled analysis of focal SCNAs
We determined the regions in which SCNAs occur at a significantly
high frequency. For this purpose, we calculated the genome-average
‘background’ratesforSCNAsinourdatasetasafunctionoflengthand
amplitude, and used the GISTIC (genomic identification of significant
targets in cancer) algorithm18 with improvements as described in
Supplementary Methods.
We identified 158 independent regions of significant focal SCNAs,
including 76 amplifications and 82 deletions, in the pooled analysis of
all our data (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 2). This number was
relatively robust to changes in the number of samples (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3a) and removal of individual cancer types from the pooled
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Indeed, a stratified analysis of 680
samples distributed evenly across the 17 most highly represented
cancer types identified 76% of these significant SCNAs, similar to
the number expected based on the reduced power of this smaller
sample set (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
The most frequent of these significant focal SCNAs (MYC ampli-
fications and CDKN2A/B deletions) involve 14% of samples, whereas
the least frequent are observed in 2.3% of samples for amplifications
and 1.5% for deletions. The frequency of significant arm-level SCNAs
is higher (15–29% of samples; Supplementary Fig. 3c). These fre-
quencies are likely to be underestimates, as some SCNAs are not
detected owing to contamination of cancer samples with DNA from
adjacent normal cells, technical error, and the incomplete spatial
resolution afforded by the SNP array platform.
For each of the 158 significant focal SCNAs, we determined a
confidence interval (‘peak region’) that has a 95% likelihood of con-
taining the targeted gene (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Our large data set
enables more sensitive and high-resolution detection of peak regions
than previous copy-number analyses (see Supplementary Note 5 and
Supplementary Table 3). An even larger data set would be desirable,
on the basis of analyses showing that the increase in resolution with
sample size has not reached a plateau (Supplementary Fig. 3e).
The 76 focal amplification peak regions contain a median of 6.5
genes each (range 0–143, including microRNAs). Sixteen regions con-
tain more than 25 genes each; the remaining 60 regions contain in
aggregate 364 potential target genes. We found that 25 of the 76
regions (33%) contain functionally validated oncogenes documented
to be activated by amplification (Supplementary Table 2), including
nine of the top ten regions (MYC, CCND1, ERBB2, CDK4, NKX2-1,
MDM2,EGFR,FGFR1andKRAS;Fig.1candSupplementary Table2).
The tenth region, on 1q, contains nine genes; we present evidence later
that the target gene in this region is the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family
member, MCL1.
The 82 focal deletion peaks contain a median of seven genes each
(range 1–173). Nineteen regions contain at least 25 genes each; the
remaining 63 regions contain in aggregate 474 potential target genes.
Nine of the 82 regions (11%) contain functionally validated tumour
suppressor genes documented to be inactivated by deletion
(Supplementary Table 2). Two other deletions (involving ETV6
and the span from TMPRSS2 to ERG) are associated with transloca-
tion events that create oncogenes. Another deletion adjacent to the
T-cell-receptor-b locus occurs in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and
likely is not associated with cancer, as it occurs during normal T-cell
development.
The remaining 70 deletion peaks do not contain known tumour
suppressor genes, translocation sites, or somatic rearrangements.
More than one-third (26) contain large genes, the genomic loci of
which span more than 750 kilobases (kb); none of these genes has
been convincingly demonstrated to be a tumour suppressor gene.
Conversely, 19 of the 40 largest genes in the genome occur in deletion
peaks (Fig. 2a; P 5 3 3 1029). This association between deletions and
large genes could be due to a propensity for both to occur in regions
of low gene density. Indeed, large genes tend to occur in gene-poor
regions (Fig. 2a, bottom), and an analysis of all SCNAs in the data set
shows that deletions (but not amplifications) show a bias towards
regions of low gene density (up to 30% below the genome average;
Fig. 2b). Even after removing the 26 SCNAs containing large genes,
the gene density among the remaining deletions is still 25% below the
genome average. These observations suggest that some of the dele-
tions may not be related to cancer aetiology, but rather may reflect a
high frequency of deletion or low levels of selection against deletion
in these regions.

Most known amplified oncogenes reside within the 76 amplified
regions, although there are exceptions. For example, MITF19 is prob-
ably undetected because it is a lineage-specific oncogene restricted to
melanoma.Atleasttenknowndeletedtumoursuppressor genesdonot
reside in the deleted regions in the pooled analysis (BRCA2, FBXW7,
NF2, PTCH1, SMARCB1, STK11, SUFU, VHL, WT1 and WTX (also
known as FAM123B)). Some of these are specific to cancer types not
represented in our data set (for example, NF2, WT1 and WTX),
whereas others (for example, BRCA2, FBXW7, STK11 and VHL)
primarily suffer arm-level deletions (with possible further deletions
beyondtheresolutionofthearrayplatform).Othertumoursuppressor
genes may be missed if they lie within regions in which the background
deletion rates are lower than the genome-wide average, or if they are
adjacentto genes inwhich deletion ispoorlytolerated (which would be
expected to occur more readily in regions of high gene density; see
Supplementary Note 1b). Such tumour suppressors might be inacti-
vated by point mutations more often than SCNAs.
Over-represented gene families and pathways
We assessed potential cancer-causing genes in the SCNAs using
GRAIL (gene relationships among implicated loci)20, an algorithm
that searches for functional relationships among genomic regions.
GRAIL scores each gene in a collection of genomic regions for its
‘relatedness’ to genes in other regions based on textual similarity
between published abstracts for all papers citing the genes, on the
notion that some target genes will function in common pathways.
We found that 47 of the 158 peak regions (34 of the 76 amplifica-
tion peaks and 13 of the 82 deletion peaks) contain genes significantly
related to genes in other peak regions (Fig. 2c). In 21 of these regions,
the highest-scoring gene was a previously validated target of SCNA in
human cancer (Supplementary Table 2). Across all peak regions, the
literature terms most significantly enriched refer to gene families
important in cancer pathogenesis, such as kinases, cell cycle regula-
tors, and MYC family members (Fig. 2d, top and Supplementary
Table 4).
To discover new genes, we next examined the 122 regions without
previously documented SCNA targets. The most significantly
enriched literature term associated with the amplification peaks
was ‘apoptosis’ (Fig. 2d, bottom and Supplementary Table 4). Two
of the five known anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family21
(MCL1 and BCL2L1) are in amplification peaks. Two of eleven
pro-apoptotic members (BOK and BBC3) were also found among
deletion peaks, for a total of four of the 16 known BCL2 family
members, with anti-apoptotic genes amplified but not deleted and
vice versa for pro-apoptotic genes (Fig. 3a; P 5 3 3 10210). Although
some BCL2 family members are known to be translocation and point
mutation targets22–26, pathway dysregulation by copy-number
change has not been well-described. Later, we describe functional
validation that MCL1 and BCL2L1 are targets of amplifications that
encompass them.
The second-ranking term among amplification peaks without
known targets was ‘NF-kB’, reflecting a preponderance of members

of this pathway (TRAF6, IKBKB, IKBKG, IRAK1 and RIPK1;
P 5 0.001 for pathway enrichment27) and consistent with an emer-
ging recognition of its importance in several cancer types28–30.
Because some gene families may have been missed by GRAIL, we
separately analysed gene ontology (GO) terms for association with
amplification peaks (data not shown). We identified significant
enrichment of genes associated with ‘molecular adaptor activity’
(GO: 0060090, P 5 4 3 10210), including IRS2, GRB2, GRB7,
GAB2, GRAP, TRAF2, TRAF6 and CRKL. IRS2 and GAB2 are known
to be transforming when overexpressed31,32, and CRKL has been
reported as an essential gene among cells in which it is amplified33.
Amplifications of MCL1 and BCL2L1
MCL1 is one of nine genes in an amplification peak in cytoband
1q21.2 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 2) with focal amplifications
observed in 10.9% of cancers across multiple tissue types. Fluor-
escence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the MCL1 region in lung
and breast cancers showed much higher rates of focal amplification
(Supplementary Fig. 4a–b). Amplifications of 1q21.2 were previously
reported in two studies of lung adenocarcinoma7,34 and one of mel-
anoma35, but the peak regions in these studies contained 86, 36 and 53
genes respectively.
Weexaminedwhether cellgrowthdependsonMCL1 inthepresence
of gene amplification by measuring the rate of change in cell number
after activating an inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against
MCL1 in cells with and without 1q21.2 amplification. We observed a
more pronounced reduction in proliferation rates among four MCL1-
amplified cell lines, compared to three MCL1-unamplified control cell
lines (P 5 0.05; Fig. 3c) (all achieved .70% knockdown; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4c). Reducing the expression of six of the other genes (all
by .70%; Supplementary Fig. 4d) within the 1q21.2 amplicon in
NCI-H2110 cells produced no significant effects (Fig. 3d). Similar
effects were observed after MCL1 depletion with many shRNAs and
short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Supplementary Fig. 4e). Growth of
NCI-H2110 xenografts were also inhibited by induction of anti-MCL1
shRNA (Fig. 3e).
BCL2L1 is one of five genes in a peak region of amplification on
20q11.21 (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Amplifications of this region have
been previously noted in lung cancer36, giant-cell tumour of bone37,
and embryonic stem cell lines (the latter also amplifying a region
including BCL2)38,39, but functional validation of BCL2L1 as a gene
targeted by these amplifications has not been reported. We examined
BCL2L1 dependency using shRNA against BCL2L1 in cells with and
without 20q11.21 amplification. We observed a more pronounced
reduction in proliferation rates among six BCL2L1-amplified lines
(including SKLU1, which was MCL1-independent), compared to
seven BCL2L1-unamplified lines (P 5 0.006; Fig. 3f). These decreased
proliferative rates were associated with increased apoptosis (Sup-
plementary Fig. 5b).
We then sought to explore how amplification of these BCL2 family
members might act in cancer by examining other SCNAs found in
cancers carrying MCL1 or BCL2L1 amplifications. The most frequent
other focal SCNA in these cancers was amplification of the region
carrying MYC (observed in approximately two-thirds of these cases).
BCL2 has previously been shown to reduce MYC-induced apoptosis
in lymphoid cells40. We found that overexpression of MCL1 and
BCL2L1 in immortalized bronchial epithelial cells also reduces
MYC-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). Oncogenic roles
for MCL1and BCL2L1 have been previously suggested by reports of
increased rates of lymphoma and leukaemia in transgenic mice41,42.
Somatic amplification of MCL1 and BCL2L1 may therefore be a
common mechanism for cancers, including carcinomas, to increase
cell survival.
Sharing of focal SCNAs across cancer types
Our analysis of a large number of cancer types with a high-resolution
platform afforded an opportunity to quantify the degree to which
significant focal SCNAs are shared across cancer types. We performed
separate analyses of each of the 17 cancer types represented by at least
40 samples and compared the significant SCNAs to those from a
pooled analysis of the remaining samples, excluding the cancer type
in question.
Most focal SCNAs identified in any one of these 17 cancer types are
also found in the pooled analysis excluding that cancer type (median
79% overlap, versus 10% for randomly permuted regions, P , 0.001;
Fig. 4) and, indeed, in the 158 regions from the overall pool.
Nonetheless, cancer-type-restricted analyses identified a further
199 significant SCNAs (145 regions of amplification, 54 regions of
deletion; Supplementary Table 5). (These exclude 79 regions of amp-
lification on chromosome 12 found only in dedifferentiated liposar-
comas that are probably related to the ring chromosomes in that
disease43). However, many of these regions were even found to occur
in more than one cancer type (median two). As would be expected,
the 158 regions in the pooled analysis were found in more cancer
types (median five) and were better localized (median size 1.5 Mb
versus 11 Mb in the lineage-restricted analyses).
Arm-level alterations, like focal SCNAs, tend to be shared among
several cancer types (Supplementary Note 4). Previous studies have
demonstrated a tendency for cancers of similar developmental
lineages to exhibit similar recurrent arm-level SCNAs44. We found
that this tendency was much more apparent for arm-level than focal
SCNAs (see Supplementary Note 6), suggesting that arm-level
SCNAs are shaped to a greater extent by developmental context.

Discussion
This study represents the largest analysis so far of high-resolution
copy-number profiles of cancer specimens. Several features of the
copy-number landscape apply to the vast majority of cancer types.
There is a notably high prevalence of arm-level SCNAs4–6, which
probably reflects the ease with which such mutational events occur
compared to focal events45,46. The analysis also shows a strong
tendency for significant focal SCNAs in one cancer type to be also
found in several others.
We identified a total of 357 significant regions of focal SCNA,
including 158 regions in the pooled analysis and 199 regions in ana-
lyses of individual cancer types. These are surely underestimates of
the number of regions that are significantly altered in cancer. Many
cancer types were represented by relatively few samples; others were
not represented at all. Some SCNAs were missed owing to the reso-
lution limit of the array platform. Further efforts will be needed to
characterize larger numbers of cancer genomes at higher resolution
to create a comprehensive catalogue of the significant SCNAs and
define their occurrence in difference cancer types.
An important challenge is to identify the cancer gene targets of each
of these SCNAs. Less than one-quarter of the 158 common peak
regions are associated with previously validated targets of SCNAs in
human cancer. Although a subset of the SCNAs may represent dele-
tion events that are tolerated but not causally involved in cancer (as
suggested by the correlation with gene-poor regions) or frequent
owing tomechanistic bias (for example, associated withfragile sites)47,
many more cancer-causing genes are likely to be found through ana-
lysis ofSCNAs.TheGRAIL analysisof ourpeak regions pointstomore
than a dozen probable candidates, and the functional analysis of
MCL1 and BCL2L1 strongly implicates these genes as amplification
targets. Moreover, some SCNAs may contain several functional
targets10.
Identification of the target genes will require both genomic and
functional studies. For focal events, the copy-number profiles of
further samples at higher resolution can help narrow the lists of
candidates. Nucleotide sequencing may identify point mutations,
especially in the case of heterozygous deletions. Because overlapping
SCNAs in different cancer types may target different genes, all can-
didates should be functionally tested separately in each cancer type in
appropriate model systems.
Although many canonical oncogenes and tumour suppressor
genes are known to be altered across several cancer types and func-
tionally relevant in model systems of diverse tissue origins1, it has not
been clear whether these genes are typical or represent a discovery
bias towards genes relevant to many cancer types. By studying a large
number of cancers of multiple types, we have found that most of the
significant SCNAs within any single cancer type tend to be found in
other cancer types as well. Similar findings for point mutations and
translocations would suggest that the appearance of tremendous
diversity across cancer genomes may reflect the combinations of a
limited number of functionally relevant events.
METHODS SUMMARY
DNA extracted from cancer specimens and normal tissue was labelled and hybri-
dized to the Affymetrix 250K Sty I array to obtain signal intensities and genotype
calls. Signal intensities were normalized against data from 1,480 normal samples.
Copy-number profiles were inferred using GLAD48 and changes of .0.1 copies in
either direction were called SCNAs. The significance of focal SCNAs (covering
,0.5 chromosome arms) was determined using GISTIC18, with modifications to
score SCNAs directly proportional to amplitude and to allow summation of non-
overlapping deletions affecting the same gene. Peak region boundaries were deter-
mined so that the change in the GISTIC score from peak to boundary had ,5%
likelihood of occurring by random fluctuation. P-values for Figs 2b and 4 were
determined by comparing the gene densities of SCNAs and fraction overlap of
peak regions, respectively, to the same quantities calculated from random permu-
tations of the locations of these SCNAs and peak regions. RNA interference was
performed by inducible and stable expression of shRNA lentiviral vectors and by
siRNA transfection. Proliferation in inducible shRNA experiments was measured
in triplicate every half-hour on 96-well plates by a real-time electric sensing system
(ACEA Bioscience), and in stable shRNA expression and siRNA transfection
experiments byCellTiterGlo(Promega).Apoptosis wasmeasuredbyimmunoblot
against cleaved PARP, and FACS analysis of cells stained with antibody to annexin
V and propidium iodide. Tumour growth in nude mice was measured by caliper
twice weekly. Expression of MYC, MCL1 and BCL2L1 was performed with retro-
viral vectors in lung epithelial cells immortalized by introduction of SV40 and
hTERT49.
