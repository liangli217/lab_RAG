INTRODUCTION: The1986Chernobyl (Chornobyl
in Ukrainian) nuclear power plant accident ex-
posed millions of individuals in the surrounding
region to radioactive contaminants, resulting
in increased papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)
incidence in radioactive iodine (131I)–exposed
children. Currently, no reliable biomarkers for
radiation-induced cancers have been identified,
and large-scale genomic characterizations of hu-
man tumors after radiation exposure are lacking.
RATIONALE: To investigate the contribution of
environmental radiation to the genomic char-
acteristics of PTC and gain further insight into
radiation-induced carcinogenesis, we analyzed
440 pathologically confirmed fresh-frozen PTCs
from Ukraine (359 with estimated childhood
or in utero 131I exposure, 81 from unexposed
children born after March 1987; mean age at
PTC = 28.0 years, range 10.0 to 45.6) and
matched normal tissue (nontumor thyroid
tissue and/or blood). Our genomic charac-
terization included whole-genome, mRNA,
and microRNA sequencing; DNA methylation
profiling; and genotyping arrays.
RESULTS: The mean estimated radiation dose
among 131I-exposed individuals was 250 mGy
(range, 11.0 to 8800). In multivariable models
adjusted for age at PTC and sex, we observed
radiation dose–dependent increases in small
deletions (P = 8.0 × 10–9) and simple/balanced
structural variants (P = 1.2 × 10–14) but no
association with single-nucleotide variants
or insertions. Further analyses demonstrated
stronger radiation-related associations for clonal—
but not subclonal—small deletions and simple/
balancedstructuralvariantsthatborehallmarksof
nonhomologous end-joining repair (deletions, P =
4.9×10–31;simple/balanced structural variants,
P = 5.5 × 10–19). In contrast, radiation dose was
not associated with locally templated insertions
characteristic of alternative end-joining repair.
Candidate drivers were identified for 433
tumors (98.4%), of which 401 had only a single
candidate driver, illustrating the parsimonious
nature of PTC carcinogenesis. More than half
of the drivers (n = 253) were mutations, oc-
curring commonly (n = 194) in BRAF. Fusions
accounted for the remaining drivers, frequently
involving RET (n = 73) or other receptor
tyrosine kinase genes (n = 64). In total, 401
PTCs had drivers in the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In multi-
variable models adjusted for age at PTC and sex,
we observed radiation dose–dependent enrich-
ment of fusion versus mutation drivers (P =
6.6 × 10–8), whereas the radiation dose dis-
tribution did not differ substantially by driver.
The effects of radiation on genomic alter-
ations (fusion drivers, deletions, or structural
variants) were more pronounced for individ-
uals who were younger at exposure. Analyses
were consistent with a linear dose response
for most radiation-associated molecular char-
acteristics. Individuals with PTC who were
unexposed to 131I or had lower doses had
higher genetic risk (P = 4.7 × 10–4) according
to a 12-locus polygenic risk score. Analyses of
transcriptomic and epigenomic features dem-
onstrated strong associations with the PTC
driver gene but not with radiation dose.
CONCLUSION: Our large-scale integrated gen-
omic landscape analysis of PTCs after the
Chernobyl accident with detailed dose estima-
tion points to DNA double-strand breaks as
early carcinogenic events that subsequently
enable PTC growth after environmental radi-
ation exposure. Tumor epigenomic and tran-
scriptomic profiles reflected the PTC driver and
did not identify a reliable set of biomarkers
for radiation-induced carcinogenesis. Non-
homologous end-joining was consistently
implicated as the key repair mechanism for
the observed radiation dose–associated DNA
double-strand breaks, leading to more fusion
drivers as a result of increasing radiation dose.
Linear increases in radiation-associated dam-
age, especially for exposure at younger ages,
underscore the potential deleterious conse-
quences of ionizing radiation exposure.▪

The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident increased papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) incidence
in surrounding regions, particularly for radioactive iodine (131I)–exposed children. We analyzed genomic,
transcriptomic, and epigenomic characteristics of 440 PTCs from Ukraine (from 359 individuals
with estimated childhood 131I exposure and 81 unexposed children born after 1986). PTCs displayed
radiation dose–dependent enrichment of fusion drivers, nearly all in the mitogen-activated protein
kinase pathway, and increases in small deletions and simple/balanced structural variants that
were clonal and bore hallmarks of nonhomologous end-joining repair. Radiation-related genomic
alterations were more pronounced for individuals who were younger at exposure. Transcriptomic and
epigenomic features were strongly associated with driver events but not radiation dose. Our results
point to DNA double-strand breaks as early carcinogenic events that subsequently enable PTC
growth after environmental radiation exposure.
T
he accidental explosion in reactor 4 at
the Chernobyl (Chornobyl in Ukrainian)
nuclear power plant in April 1986 re-
sulted in the exposure of millions of
inhabitants of Ukraine, Belarus, and the
Russian Federation to radioactive contaminants
(1). Epidemiologic and clinical research in the
ensuing decades has demonstrated an increased
risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with
increasing thyroid gland exposure to radioactive
iodine (131I) from fallout, which was deposited
on pastures with grazing cows and ingested
through milk and leafy greens, particularly
during early childhood (2). Together with data
from populations exposed to other types of ra-
diation, compelling evidence indicates that PTC
risk increases after childhood exposure to ioniz-
ing radiation, a recognized carcinogen (2–5).
Currently, there are no established molecu-
lar biomarkers for cancers induced by radia-
tion, nor have there been large-scale analyses
of the genomic landscape of human cancers
occurring after a well-quantified radiation ex-
posure. Classical cytogenetic studies have dem-
onstrated radiation dose–associated increases
in large chromosomal aberrations (such as
inversions and translocations) that reflect
DNA double-strand breaks and are the cur-
rent standard for biodosimetry; however, these
assays are typically performed in peripheral
blood lymphocytes from individuals exposed
to whole-body irradiation and have not been
directly linked to tumor characteristics (6, 7).
Next-generationsequencingof12 secondprimary
tumors of various types that occurred within
the field of previous therapeutic ionizing radia-
tion suggested an excess of small deletions
and balanced inversions (8), but radiation
dose estimates were not available. RNA se-
quencing (RNA-seq) analyses of 65 PTCs (mean
age at diagnosis = 24.7 years) occurring after
the Chernobyl accident revealed that higher
doses were associated with an increased like-
lihood of gene fusion drivers (9). In a genomic
landscape analysis of 496 primarily unexposed
PTCs (mean age at diagnosis = 46.8 years;
16 patients with known prior radiation expo-
sure), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) re-
ported a low density of somatic point mutations,
especially for PTCs in younger patients, and
a high frequency of activating somatic alter-
ations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway, including point mutations
inBRAF(61.7%) and NRAS/HRAS/KRAS (12.9%)
as well as fusions with RET (6.8%), BRAF (2.7%),
and other MAPK-related genes (5.0%) (10).
Here, we report a comprehensive character-
ization of the genomic, transcriptomic, and
epigenomic profile of PTC as well as nontumor
thyroid tissue and/or blood for 440 individ-
uals from Ukraine who developed PTC after the
Chernobyl accident (mean age at diagnosis =
28.0 years), affording an opportunity to in-
vestigate the contribution of environmental
radiation to PTC characteristics. The study ana-
lyzed a collection of pretreatment fresh-frozen
tumor tissues with pathological confirmation
of first primary PTC by an international panel
of experts through the Chernobyl Tissue Bank
(CTB) (11, 12). Our study included 359 individ-
uals with PTC with well-quantified 131I expo-
sure before adulthood (≤18 years of age; mean =
7.3 years) and, as controls, 81 131I-unexposed
individuals with PTC born >9 months after
the Chernobyl accident (all were born after
1 March 1987) (13).
Samples, clinical data, and analytic approach
On the basis of the availability of sufficient
DNA and RNA extracted from CTB samples,
we analyzed up to 440 individuals with whole-
genome sequencing (WGS) and/or mRNA-seq
of pathologically confirmed tumor (374, both;
57, mRNA-seq only; 9, WGS only) (figs. S1 and
S2) (13). Matched normal tissue with WGS
and/or mRNA-seq included nontumor thyroid

tissue and/or blood (233, both; 182, nontumor
tissue only; 16, blood only; 9, normal tissue not
available). The genomic landscape character-
ization was augmented by single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotyping
(Illumina Infinium HumanOmniExpress-24
array) and relative telomere length quantifi-
cation on all samples, and DNA methylation
profiling (Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC
array) and microRNA (miRNA)–seq for PTC
and nontumor thyroid tissue (fig. S3). A total
of 357 individuals had tumor sample data
across all platforms.
The majority of individuals with PTC were
female [n = 335 (76.1%)], resided in the Kiev
(Kyiv in Ukrainian) region at the time of the
accident [n = 286 (65.0%)], and were diagnosed
during young adulthood (mean = 28.0 years;
range, 10.0 to 45.6). 131I-unexposed individuals
with PTC were born at least 9 months after
the accident and thus had a younger average
age than the exposed individuals (mean: un-
exposed = 20.7 years, exposed = 29.7 years)
(table S1 and fig. S4). For 131I-exposed individ-
uals, mean age at exposure was 7.3 years (range,
in utero to 18.9 years) and mean time from
the accident to PTC diagnosis was 22.4 years
(range, 12.5 to 29.9). Radiation doses to the
thyroid were reconstructed by an international
team of dosimetry experts (14–16). For 53 indi-
viduals, doses were estimated using detailed
information derived from individual direct
thyroid radioactivity measurements taken
within 8 weeks of the accident, with (n = 49)
or without (n = 4) personal interviews regard-
ing residential history and dietary patterns.
For the remaining individuals, dose estimates
were derived from direct measurements taken
for other individuals who lived in the same
residential area (n = 249), neighboring area
(n = 9), or other areas (n = 39), or were based on
dose estimates to the mother for individuals
who were in utero at the time of the accident
(n = 9). The mean estimated radiation dose was
250 mGy (range, 11 to 8800) (figs. S4 and S5).
Our primary analyses investigated the rela-
tionship between 131I dose and 68 PTC molecular
characteristics derived from a comprehensive
genomic landscape analysis (Fig. 1) using mul-
tivariable linear, proportional odds, or logistic
regression models adjusted for sex and age
at PTC diagnosis (13). For associated variables
(defined as P < 7.4 × 10–4 based on a Bonferroni
correction for 68 tests), further analyses were
conducted by specific molecular characteristics,
as well as by age at PTC, age at exposure, and
time since exposure (latency) because these fac-
tors influence radiation-related thyroid cancer
risk (17). In addition, we conducted sensitiv-
ity analyses to assess whether the results were
consistent when we restricted the population
to 131I-exposed individuals with lower radia-
tion dose (<500 mGy, resulting in n = 326 with
mean dose = 110 mGy) (18, 19).
Simple somatic variants
WGS analysis of tumor/normal pairs (n = 383;
mean sequencing depth, tumor = 89×, non-
tumor thyroid tissue = 33×, blood = 33×; table
S2) revealed a low burden of simple somatic
variants (SSVs) (mean = 0.27 nonsynonymous
mutations per Mb) (Fig. 1 and figs. S6 and S7),
which was lower than in older TCGA PTC
cases (0.41 nonsynonymous mutations per Mb)
(10) and comparable to mutationally quiet
tumors typically reported for pediatric cancers
(20). A total of 318,956 SSVs were identified,
the majority (93.3%) of which were single-
nucleotide variants (SNVs) (n = 297,512 in
383 tumors; mean per tumor = 776.8), whereas
small insertions and deletions (indels) were less
common [insertions: n = 5842 (1.8%), mean =
37.2; deletions: n = 14,231 (4.5%), mean = 15.3],
and doublet and triplet base substitutions
were rare [dinucleotide polymorphism (DNP)
or doublet: n = 1351 (0.4%), mean = 3.5; tri-
nucleotide polymorphism (TNP) or triplet:

n = 20 (0.006%)] (table S3). Among the 3886
coding mutations (1.2% of total; 0.35/Mb),
most were nonsynonymous (3023/3886 = 77.8%).
About one-third of mutations [n = 114,898
(36.0%)] were clonal (cancer cell fraction ≥0.9),
regardless of mutation type (SNVs = 35.9%,
insertions = 36.7%, deletions = 38.0%) (table
S3 and fig. S8) (13).
In multivariable analyses restricted to n =
356 samples with both high tumor purity and
normal tissue purity (Fig. 1 and fig. S9) (13),
increased radiation dose was associated with
an increase in small deletions (P = 8.0 × 10–9)
as well as in the deletion:SNV ratio (P = 4.9 ×
10–21), but not in other SSV types (Fig. 2, A and
D, and table S4). In addition, we observed the
expected increase in the burden of SNVs (P =
3.2 × 10–6), doublet mutations (P = 2.7 × 10–5),
insertions (P = 1.5 × 10–6), and deletions (P =
7.4 × 10–16) with increasing age at PTC diagnosis
(table S4) (10). Few of these mutations were
clustered [22 clusters (>2 mutations within 150
base pairs) in 18 cases; 83 clusters (>2 muta-
tions within 1 kb) in 36 cases] and were not
associated with radiation dose (P > 0.3). In an
analysis of the frequency and types of micro-
satellite indels in the tumors, detected using
MSMuTect (21), all tumors were microsatellite
stable [mean per tumor, insertions = 1.8 (range,
0 to 7), deletions = 7.3 (range, 0 to 24)], and
radiation dose was not significantly associated
with the number of microsatellite insertions
or deletions (table S4).
An investigation of mutational processes
in PTC was conducted using SigProfiler to
determine both single-base substitution (SBS)
and small indel (ID) mutational signatures
(20, 22). Comparing the PTC mutations with
known signatures from the Catalogue of
Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC v3,
https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures)
(20), the majority of the SBS signatures (69.9%)
were attributable to clock-like signatures (SBS1 =
9.8%, SBS5 = 60.2%), with smaller fractions due
to APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing
enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) cytidine
deaminase DNA-editing activity (SBS2 = 6.2%,
SBS13 = 6.4%), damage from reactive oxygen
species (SBS18 = 0.9%), and two signatures of
unknown etiology (SBS8 = 15.1%, SBS23 = 1.6%)
(mean cosine similarity between actual muta-
tions and attributed patterns = 0.94) (Fig. 1,
table S5, and figs. S10 to S12). In multivariable
analyses, no SBS signatures were significantly
associatedwithradiationdose,whereasincreased
age at PTC diagnosis was associated with an
increase in clock-like SBS mutations (PSBS1 =
1.9 × 10–7; PSBS5 = 6.8 × 10–17) as well as SBS8
(P = 4.3 × 10–11) and SBS18 (P = 2.0 × 10–8)
(table S4).
The majority (54.0%) of indels were at-
tributed to clock-like signatures (ID1 = 14.2%,
ID5 = 39.8%), 21.2% to ID3 (tobacco smoking,
which is not a major risk factor for PTC), 19.0%
to repair of DNA double-strand breaks by end-
joining mechanisms (ID6 = 3.3%, ID8 = 15.8%),

and 5.8% to ID4 (unknown etiology) (mean
cosine similarity = 0.77) (Fig. 1, table S5, and
figs. S10 to S12). In multivariable analyses,
radiation dose was strongly associated with
end joining–related indel mutational patterns
(P = 1.5 × 10–10), particularly ID8 (P = 7.3 × 10–9),
and more weakly with the clock signature
ID5 (P = 1.3 × 10–4) (Fig. 2, G and J, and table
S4). In comparison, increased age at PTC
diagnosis was associated with significantly
increased numbers of ID3 (P = 1.9 × 10–7),
ID5 (P = 1.9 × 10–9), and ID8 (P = 6.6 × 10–4)
mutational patterns (table S4). De novo sig-
nature extraction did not reveal a novel sig-
nature related to environmental exposure to
ionizing radiation but identified four SBS
signatures (mean cosine similarity = 0.96) and
two ID signatures (mean cosine similarity =
0.83) that were highly correlated with the
COSMIC signatures described above (tables S4
and S5 and figs. S10 to S12). Similarly, no novel
signature was identified when we restricted
the analysis to PTCs in individuals who
received ≥200 mGy (table S5).
Structural variation
Overall, 479 structural variants (SVs) were
identified in 356 tumors; about one-quarter
of SVs (n = 132, 27.6%) were simple/balanced
events (balanced interchromosomal transloca-
tions and inversions), one-half (n = 253, 52.8%)
were simple/unbalanced (such as deletions and
unbalanced interchromosomal translocations),
and the remainder (n = 94, 19.6%) were com-
plex (such as >2 breaks repaired together in
a cluster) (table S6 and figs. S13 and S14) (13).
About one-third of tumors (n = 113, 31.7%) had
no SV, one-third (n = 126, 35.4%) had one SV,
and the remaining one-third had two (n = 61,
17.1%) or more (n = 56, 15.7%) SVs. Two tumors
had >10 SV events (fig. S15), one of which
was the only tumor with evidence for chromo-
thripsis (age at PTC = 30.2 years, age at expo-
sure = 1.3 years, dose = 1000 mGy).
Multivariable analyses (n = 354, excluding
the two outliers) demonstrated that increasing
radiation dose was significantly associated with
increased SV count (P = 1.4 × 10–8), particularly
simple/balanced SVs (P = 1.2 × 10–14) but not
those classified as complex (P = 0.52) or simple/
unbalanced (P = 5.6 × 10–3) (Fig. 3A and table
S4). Increasing radiation dose also was not
associated with occurrence of chromoplexy
(P = 0.70) (table S4), which was identified in
19 tumors (n = 15, single event; n = 4, two
events) (13, 23), nearly all in the unexposed or
lower-dose groups (nunexposed = 7, n1–99 mGy = 8,
n100–199 mGy = 2, n≥500 mGy = 2).
Somatic copy number alteration
A total of 40.3% (n = 143/355) of the tumors
evaluated for somatic copy number alterations
(SCNAs) had one [n = 96 (27.0%)] or more
[n = 47 (13.2%)] such events (fig. S16) (13).
Four tumors had ≥20 SCNAs each (fig. S17):

tional tumors (age at PTC = 19.0 to 29.3 years,
age at exposure = 1.3 to 2.3 years, dose = 125
to 175 mGy). These three tumors predomi-
nantly had gains or copy-neutral loss of hete-
rozygosity (CNLOH) and were the only tumors
with ploidy >2.5, with one of the three dis-
playing extensive CNLOH (>20 arms), similar
to previous reports for the rare thyroid Hürthle
cell carcinoma (24, 25). Exclusion of the four
tumors with ≥20 SCNAs each yielded 239 total
SCNAs: 69 (28.9%) at the chromosome level,
of which 48 were deletions, and 170 (71.1%)
subchromosomal, of which 106 were dele-
tions (table S6).
In multivariable models, radiation dose was
related to the number of subchromosomal

(P = 7.0 × 10–4) but not gains (P = 0.32) or

CNLOH (P = 0.52); radiation dose also was
not related to the number of chromosomal
SCNAs (P = 0.20) (table S4). The most fre-
quent recurrent event was loss of 22q [n = 47/
353 (13.3%)] (figs. S18 and S19), but occurrence
of 22q deletions was not associated with ra-
diation dose (P = 0.37) (table S4).
Drivers of PTC
We identified at least one candidate driver for
433 of 440 (98.4%) tumors (fig. S20 and table
S7) (13), with the majority [n = 401 (92.6%)]
having a single candidate driver, underscoring
the parsimony of events driving PTC carcino-
genesis. We designated 429 (97.5%) drivers
for analysis (Fig. 1). More than half of the
designated driver events [n = 253 (59.0%)]
were mutations (SSVs; table S8), predominantly
activating point mutations in genes previ-
ously implicated in PTC. The most commonly
mutated gene was BRAF [n = 194 (45.2%)],
where all the mutations either were canonical
BRAFV600E substitutions (n = 190) or disrupted
the V600 sequence context (n = 4). RAS genes
were the next most commonly mutated [n =
44 (10.3%)], specifically NRAS [n = 20 (4.7%)],
HRAS [n = 15 (3.5%)], and KRAS [n = 9 (2.1%)].
Additional mutation drivers were identified in
TSHR [n = 6 (1.4%)], DICER1 [n = 3 (0.7%)],
APC [n = 2 (0.5%)], TSC1/TSC2 [n = 2 (0.5%)],
and NFE2L2 [n = 2 (0.5%)]. In TCGA, 9.4% of
PTC harbored TERT promoter mutations, often
in older individuals (10), but only one individual
with a TERT promoter mutation was observed
in our study (age at PTC diagnosis = 40.7 years,
designated driver = BRAFV600E).
Fusion drivers accounted for 176 (41.0%)
PTC cases (table S9). The most frequently
involved genes were RET [n = 73 (17.0%)] as
well as other receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
genes, specifically NTRK3 [n = 36 (8.4%)],
NTRK1 [n = 13 (3.0%)], ALK [n = 12 (2.8%)],
and LTK [n = 3 (0.7%)]. Additional fusion
drivers included BRAF [n = 20 (4.7%)] and
PPARG [n = 13 (3.0%)], as well as SVs that
resulted in overexpression of IGF2 or IGF2BP3
[n = 6 (1.4%)]. Of the 23 chromoplexy events
described above, 16 generated driver fusions.
All 22q deletions co-occurred with known
driver mutations, most frequently RAS muta-
tions (Pheterogeneity = 2.8 × 10–10; n = 22/38,
56.4%) (table S10).
In multivariable analyses, fusion drivers in
PTC were more common in individuals ex-
posed to higher radiation dose (P = 6.6 × 10–8)
and in those diagnosed at younger ages (P =
5.4 × 10–9) relative to those with mutation
drivers (Fig. 3B and table S4). There was a
suggestion of a heterogeneous effect of dose
by specific gene fusion (Pheterogeneity = 0.020),
with higher doses on average for PTCs with
IGF2/IGF2BP3 orBRAFfusiondrivers,whereas
the dose distribution did not differ significantly
among mutation drivers (BRAF, RAS, other;
Pheterogeneity = 0.17) (Fig. 4). We extended our
observations by inclusion of 45 nonoverlap-
ping individuals with PTC (excluding the 20
individuals already in our analyses) drawn
from a previous Chernobyl study with known
drivers identified with RNA-seq (9); more than
half had doses of ≥500 mGy (mean age at
PTC = 24.2 years, mean age at exposure =
7.2 years, mean dose = 1050 mGy) (table S1).
That smaller sample set also suggested a ra-
diation dose-related increase in fusion drivers
(P = 0.069), which was consistent with the
results from our study (Pheterogeneity = 0.90;
pooled analysis of fusion versus mutation
driver, adjusting for age at PTC, sex, and study:
P = 4.6 × 10–9).
Gene expression and methylation patterns
Weconducted severalanalysestoassesswhether
gene expression and methylation patterns were
related to radiation dose. First, unsupervised
clustering analyses restricted to PTC tumor
tissue yielded five mRNA clusters, five miRNA
clusters, and three methylation clusters (figs.
S21 and S22) (13). None of these clusterings
were associated with radiation dose (PmRNA =
0.85; PmiRNA = 0.38; Pmethylation = 0.10), but
each closely correlated with the driver gene
pathway (PmRNA = 1.6 × 10–64; PmiRNA = 1.0 ×
10–9; Pmethylation = 6.4 × 10–43) (Fig. 5A, tables
S4 and S11, and fig. S23), supporting the
overriding importance of the driver for RNA
expression patterns (10). Second, we identified
three transcriptional patterns important in
PTC on the basis of the TCGA analysis (10): (i)
the BRAFV600E-RAS score (BRS), estimating
the degree to which the mRNA, miRNA, and
methylation profiles resemble either BRAFV600E
or RAS-mutated PTC; (ii) the thyroid differ-
entiation score (TDS), based on expression of
16 thyroid metabolism and function genes;
and (iii) the ERK-activity score of 52 expressed
genes responsive to MEK inhibition (13). As
expected, the mRNA, miRNA, and methyla-
tion BRS scores were highly correlated with
one another (r = 0.78 to 0.92) (table S12).
Consistent with TCGA (10), the three different
mRNA-based scores also were significantly cor-
related, particularly the BRS with both the TDS
(r = 0.69) and the ERK score (r = –0.66). None
of the scores were associated with radia-
tion dose after correction for multiple testing
(PmRNA-BRS = 2.1 × 10–3; PmiRNA-BRS = 5.5 × 10–3;
Pmethylation-BRS = 0.082; PTDS = 7.8 × 10–3; PERK =
0.011) (table S4 and fig. S24A), whereas each
was strongly related to driver gene pathway
(P < 1.0 × 10–30 for all scores) (fig. S24B).
To confirm the lack of association between
radiation exposure and gene expression pat-
terns, we conducted exploratory analyses of the
differential expression of specific genes and
gene sets by dose (13). In multivariable linear
regression models adjusted for age at PTC, sex,
and batch, the Padjusted for dose was <0.05 for
five genes (Fig. 5B and table S13), with the
smallest P value (Padjusted = 8.0 × 10–3; log10-fold
expression change per 100 mGy = 0.059) for
transfer RNA asparagine (anticodon GUU)

(TRNAN-GUU-2), which is a target of the
transcription factor MYBL2, a key regulator of
cell cycle progression and apoptosis (26, 27).
However, each of these associations was at-
tenuated when the model was further adjusted
for the driver gene pathway (table S13). In
contrast, more than half of the genes were dif-
ferentially expressed (Padjusted < 0.05) among
the different driver gene pathways (table S13).
Despite previous reports suggesting that radia-
tion dose could be linked to CLIP2 expression
(28–30), no such relationship was observed in
our substantively larger study, which included
33 overlapping samples from the previously
published analyses (29) (fig. S25), either in
the overall set of PTC cases (P = 0.42, Fig. 5C)
or in subsets defined by early age at radiation
exposure (fig. S26). An exploration of expres-
sion signatures through gene set enrichment
analyses was pursued in the Molecular Signa-
tures Database (MSigDB; www.gsea-msigdb.
org/gsea/msigdb) (31). For 3213 gene sets
(those related to hallmark biological processes,
thyroid, radiation, and the genes included in
germline analyses below) (13), multivariable
regression models adjusting for age at PTC,
sex, and batch revealed results similar to those
above for single-gene differential expression
analyses; that is, no gene set expression pat-
terns were significantly associated with radia-
tion dose (Padjusted < 0.05), whereas more than
half were strongly associated with the driver
gene pathway (fig. S27 and table S14).
Germline genetic variation
The possible contribution of germline genetic
variation to radiation-related PTC was inves-
tigated in individuals of comparable Ukrainian
ancestry (n = 383 individuals, including 305
exposed, 78 unexposed) (fig. S28). Twelve pre-
viously reported risk SNPs for sporadic PTC
were used to generate a polygenic risk score
(PRS) (32). Multivariable analyses adjusting
for population substructure revealed that un-
exposed individuals with PTC and those who
received lower radiation doses were more likely
to have higher genetic risk (P = 4.7 × 10–4) (Fig.
6 and table S4). Analyses of the 12 individual
SNPs, albeit underpowered, yielded three pos-
sible associations with radiation dose: rs1588635
(9q22.33; P = 0.012), rs2289261 (15q22.33,
SMAD3; P = 0.030), and rs10069690 (5p15.33,
TERT; P = 0.054) (table S15).
Investigation of rare potentially protein-
damaging variants in genes and pathways re-
lated to thyroid or other cancer predisposition,
clinical radiation sensitivity syndromes, and
DNA damage response revealed no major
differences in the burden of these variants
among individuals who developed PTC after
different radiation doses (tables S4, S16, and
S17). Only four individuals [n = 2 (2.6%)
unexposed; n = 2 (1.2%) <100 mGy; 0 (0%)
≥100 mGy] carried potentially protein-damaging
variants in known thyroid cancer susceptibility
genes (tables S16 and S17).
Detailed analyses of molecular characteristics
associated with radiation dose
Analyses by clonality for each of the deletion
metrics (total deletion count, deletion:SNV ratio,
and ID5 and ID8 mutational patterns) revealed
that the radiation dose–related associations
were consistently restricted to clonal rather
than subclonal deletions (Fig. 2 and table S18).
Similarly, analyses of SCNAs also demonstrated
associations only with clonal but not subclonal
subchromosomal deletions (table S18). Because
distinct repair mechanisms can generate dele-
tions of different lengths (33–35), we further
stratified the clonal deletion count by length
(fig. S29) and found the strongest association
between radiation dose and clonal deletions

characteristic of end-joining repair (P = 4.9 ×
10–31) (Fig. 3C and table S18). These results are
consistent with the ID8 mutational associa-
tion and suggest a key role for end-joining
mechanisms in repairing radiation-induced
DNA double-strand breaks. Analyses of the
≥5-bp clonal deletions with respect to the
amount of microhomology at the deletion
boundary revealed consistent associations be-
tween radiation dose and deletions with 0- to

pair mechanisms, which are used regardless

(TMEJ) typically generate deletions with ≥2-bp
microhomology (33–35). In an ancillary anal-
ysis, we quantified in the small insertions the
number of TINS (locally templated insertions),
which are characteristic of TMEJ repair (34),
and found that TINS were not associated with
radiation dose (P = 0.69) (fig. S30). Further
exploration of insertions and deletions by
genomic sequence context (8) revealed only
weak correlations for radiation dose with oc-
currence of deletions classified by flanking
GC content (P = 0.015), proximity to CPG islands
(P = 0.014), and the mean replication timing
at the variant locus (P = 0.010); in each case,
deletions in the higher–radiation dose groups
were more similar to a random background
distribution (table S19) (13). No such correla-
tions between radiation dose and genomic
sequence context were observed for insertions.
We undertook similar analyses of SVs after
confirming each event (table S6) (13), identify-
ing those SVs with <20 bp of intervening loss/
gain at the breakpoint, which indicates repair
by end-joining mechanisms (33–35). Increased
radiation dose was strongly associated with
simple/balanced SVs that were clonal (P =
1.4 × 10–16) but not subclonal (P = 0.91), with
a pronounced association for clonal simple/
balanced SVs enriched for patterns characte-
ristic of end-joining mechanisms (P = 5.5 × 10–19)
(Fig. 3D) versus other clonal SVs (P = 0.41, Fig.
3E) (table S18). Further analyses demonstra-
ted consistent associations for radiation dose
with clonal simple/balanced/end-joining SVs
with <4 bp and 4 to <20 bp of intervening
loss/gain (table S18). Similar to our observa-
tionsforsmalldeletions,theseresultsspecifically
implicate the importance of NHEJ repair, which
accounts for almost all <4-bp events but which
could contribute regardless of the amount of
intervening loss/gain. By comparison, alt-EJ
repair mechanisms primarily give rise to events
with ≥4 bp of intervening loss/gain (33–35).
Additional analyses of clonal simple/balanced/
end-joining SVs by type revealed a strong as-
sociation between radiation dose and inversions
(P = 3.6 × 10–14), consistent with a previous
report (8), but also an association with trans-
locations (P = 4.4 × 10–4) (table S18).
For each of the radiation dose–associated
variables, the results were similar when we
restricted the study population to exposed
individuals (table S20). Albeit based on limited
statistical power, further restriction to individ-
uals with exposures of 1 to <500 mGy revealed
consistent associations for dose only with
the clonal deletion:SNV ratio, enrichment of
fusion drivers, and presence of clonal simple/
balanced/EJ SVs (table S20). Linear-quadratic
and linear-exponential models of radiation
dose generally did not improve the model fit
relative to a linear model for any of the variables,
except for clonal small deletions (total and
restricted to ≥5-bp EJ deletions) (table S20).
Notably, radiation dose–related increases in
clonal deletions (particularly the deletion:SNV
ratio, ID8, and the number of clonal ≥5 bp EJ
small deletions), as well as fusion PTC drivers,
were substantially more pronounced for in-
dividuals exposed at younger ages (Fig. 7 and
tables S21 and S22), albeit based on small
numbers for certain analyses. In contrast, the
radiation dose–related increase in SCNA clonal
subchromosomal deletions was most pronounced
at longer latencies (table S21).
Radiation-related acceleration of
PTC development
Exploratory analyses to address previous re-
ports that ionizing radiation exposure accel-
erates aging and cancer development (36, 37)
revealed no such evidence in our study popu-
lation. First, we stratified analyses of the rela-
tionship of clock-like SBS and ID signatures
with age at PTC and latency but found no
effect modification by radiation dose (age at
PTC: PSBS = 0.63, PID = 0.93; latency: PSBS =
0.28, PID = 0.21) (figs. S31 and S32). Addition-
ally, radiation dose–dependent associations
with key molecular characteristics did not ap-
pear to be strongly modified by latency after
accounting for age at exposure and age at PTC
(table S21). Analyses of relative telomere length
demonstrated the expected association be-
tween decreased telomere length and increased
age at PTC in blood (P = 3.2 × 10–5) but not in
normal thyroid tissue (P = 0.99) or PTC (P =
0.81), and there was no association between
relative telomere length and thyroid radiation
dose (P > 0.4 for all tissues). Methylation
profiles were evaluated to estimate epige-
netic age acceleration using two established
metrics (38, 39). Regressing epigenetic age
against chronological age in the nontumor
thyroid tissue and then comparing the resid-
uals from this predicted age in the PTC tissue
(13) revealed no association between age ac-
celerationandradiationdoseusingeithermetric
(P > 0.1).
Discussion
Our large-scale integrated analyses of the
genomic landscape of PTC that developed
after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant
accident provide consistent evidence that ion-
izing radiation–induced DNA damage, partic-
ularly double-strand breaks, represents an early
carcinogenic event in thyroid tumorigenesis
after radiation exposure. These findings subs-
tantially extend preliminary reportsof radiation-
related human tumor characteristics (8, 9) by
integrating data from multiple platforms with
large sample size and detailed radiation dose
data. Increased radiation dose was strongly
associated with increased likelihood of fusion
versus point mutation drivers as well as simple/
balanced SVs and small deletions, particularly
those that bore hallmarks of NHEJ repair and
were clonal, with stronger associations for
individuals exposed at a young age. How-
ever, no unique radiation-related biomarker
was identified. Together, our results indicate
that thyroid tumorigenesis after radiation
exposure results from DNA double-strand
breaks in the genome that have an impact on
key thyroid cell growth and differentiation
genes, which in turn drive the expression
and epigenetic characteristics of individ-
ual PTCs.
Most tumors had evidence for only a single,
known oncogenic driver, which involved the
MAPK pathway in nearly all cases; this is con-
sistent with previously published studies of
sporadic PTCs (10, 40, 41). These findings,
combined with the low mutational burden
in thyroid tumors, emphasize the efficiency
of driver mutations in thyroid tumorigenesis
even after ionizing radiation exposure; in con-
trast, other environmentally driven cancers,
such as cigarette smoking and lung adeno-
carcinoma or ultraviolet light and melanoma,
often require multiple drivers and have multi-
ple subclones together with substantial somatic
burden (23).
Our study, based on multiple lines of evi-
dence, demonstrates striking radiation dose–
related increases in DNA double-strand breaks
in human thyroid cancers developing after the
Chernobyl accident, extending results from
in vitro and animal radiobiological experiments
(33–35). In contrast, the PTCs did not have evi-
dence of radiation-related specific base muta-
tions or clustered mutations (42). Cells with
DNA double-strand breaks can recruit various
repair mechanisms, each of which leaves cha-
racteristic evidence in the repaired sequence.
A series of analyses consistently implicated
NHEJ as the most important repair mecha-
nism for the radiation dose–associated DNA
double-strand breaks observed in the PTCs.
Although the importance of end-joining re-
pair in human tumors has been reported
previously (8), our detailed examination of the
local sequence context for the SVs (including
fusion drivers) and small deletions enabled us
to clarify that radiation dose was most clearly
associated with NHEJ rather than alt-EJ or
other repair mechanisms. The lack of associa-
tion between radiation dose and TINS further
demonstrated the lack of importance of alt-EJ
mechanisms. The importance of NHEJ repair
also was supported by the lack of significant
association between radiation dose and muta-
tional signatures associated with APOBEC,
which preferentially targets intermediates in
replication and repair by homologous recom-
bination (43). Our results necessitate further
research, such as the use of genetically modified
organoids (44, 45), to establish the causal role
of radiation-related DNA double-strand breaks
predominantly repaired by NHEJ in human
carcinogenesis.

The role of radiation-related DNA damage
as an early step in PTC carcinogenesis after
the Chernobyl accident is further supported
by the lack of association between radiation
dose and PTC transcriptomic and epigenomic
features, despite the use of various analytic
approaches, including clustering, differential
expression by gene or miRNA, and gene set
enrichment analyses. With our large sample
size, we did not confirm the previously reported
association between radiation dose and CLIP2
expression (28–30), even when we restricted
our analyses to individuals exposed at younger
ages. Notably, however, the PTC transcriptomic
and epigenomic features differed strikingly
by driver gene/pathway, supporting the im-
portance of the specific driver in shaping the
tumor profile (10, 40, 41). Use of both WGS
and RNA-seq enabled us to identify a driver
in 98% of the PTCs in our study. Deletion of
chromosome 22q has been suggested as a
driver for PTC, but all cases in our study with
22q deletions also had other known PTC drivers,
which suggests that 22q did not act indepen-
dently in our set of individuals who developed
PTC during young adulthood. Intriguingly,
however, 22q deletions were strongly related to
the driver pathway, occurring most commonly
in RAS-mutated PTCs; hence, 22q deletion
could provide a growth advantage or otherwise
enhance the effect of certain MAPK drivers.
With our large sample size, we were able to
explore the independent effects of radiation
dose, age at PTC, age at exposure, and latency
on PTC molecular characteristics. The pro-
nounced evidence of radiation-related damage
that we observed for individuals exposed at
younger ages is consistent with epidemiologic
analyses that have identified higher thyroid
cancer risks with radiation exposure at youn-
ger ages (17). The relationship of a number of
molecular characteristics, particularly total
mutational burden and driver type, with age
at PTC warrants further investigation across
a broader age range (10). Additional studies
with detailed dose data are needed to under-
stand whether our findings extend across a
broader dose range, to other types of radiation,
as well as to other tumor types, and whether
radiation-related genomic characteristics have
an impact on histopathological parameters
(46–48). It has been hypothesized that ioniz-
ing radiation exposure could accelerate tumor
development, and substantial evidence dem-
onstrates that cancer survivors exposed to high-
dose radiotherapy exhibit an aging phenotype
(36, 37). However, exploratory analyses within
our data did not support this hypothesis.
Our results have important implications for
radiation protection and public health, particu-
larly for low-dose exposure, from two perspec-
tives. First, the lack of a unique radiation-related
pattern of molecular characteristics in the PTCs
in our study, due in part to the random nature
of ionizing radiation–related damage across the
genome as well as the fact that other mutagens
can cause DNA double-strand breaks, suggests
that we are yet to establish a reliable biomarker
to distinguish tumors induced by radiation ver-
sus other causes. Nonetheless, further investiga-
tion is warranted to consider how the radiation
dose–associated characteristics we identified
could be incorporated into estimates of the
probability that a specific PTC was caused by
131I exposure [probability of causation (POC)
(fig. S5) (49, 50)], which is currently based on
prior epidemiologic studies (17). Second, our
data are consistent with a linear dose re-
sponse for the key molecular characteristics
associated with radiation dose in the range
examined in our analysis (≤1 Gy), which aligns
with the extensive radiobiological literature
and other epidemiologic evidence regarding
DNA damage and cancer risk after ionizing
radiation exposure (51, 52).
Our study population included a substantial
number of PTCs occurring after exposure to
less than 100 mGy, likely reflecting the avail-
ability of samples from the Chernobyl Tissue
Bank as well as the increased detection of
preexisting PTC in the population that may
not become clinically evident until later, if at
all,becauseofintensivescreeningandheightened
awareness of thyroid cancer risk in Ukraine.
The increased genetic risk based on the PRS
was notable among PTCs that occurred after
lower doses despite limited statistical power
to investigate germline genetic variants. The
low overall mutational burden of early adult-
hood PTC, small sample sizes in certain popula-
tion subgroups, and uncertainties in radiation
dose estimates also limited our statistical power
to thoroughly investigate the shape of the dose-
response curve, precisely identify the magni-
tude of radiation-related effects (as reflected
by the wide confidence intervals for many ef-
fect estimates), or reliably identify new radia-
tion signatures.
This study has characterized the genomic
landscape of PTC, the most frequent cancer
observed after the Chernobyl nuclear accident.
Our results demonstrate a dose-dependent
carcinogenic effect of radiation derived primar-
ily from DNA double-strand breaks repaired by
NHEJ that initiate subsequent thyroid tumor
growth, the patterns of which are shaped not
by radiation exposure but rather by the specific
driver gene. The consistency of the spectrum
of PTC drivers in our study population relative
to previous PTC series suggests that current
therapeutic approaches for PTC are appropri-
ate even for tumors that arise after radiation
exposure (53). Our work provides a foundation
for further investigation of radiation-induced
cancer, particularly with respect to differences
in risk as a function of both dose and age, and
underscores the deleterious consequences of
ionizing radiation exposure.
