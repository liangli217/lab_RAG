We describe a computational method that infers tumor purity 
and malignant cell ploidy directly from analysis of somatic 
DNA alterations. The method, named ABSOLUTE, can detect 
subclonal heterogeneity and somatic homozygosity, and it 
can calculate statistical sensitivity for detection of specific 
aberrations. We used ABSOLUTE to analyze exome sequencing 
data from 214 ovarian carcinoma tumor-normal pairs. This 
analysis identified both pervasive subclonal somatic point-
mutations and a small subset of predominantly clonal and 
homozygous mutations, which were overrepresented in the 
tumor suppressor genes TP53 and NF1 and in a candidate 
tumor suppressor gene CDK12. We also used ABSOLUTE to 
infer absolute allelic copy-number profiles from 3,155 diverse 
cancer specimens, revealing that genome-doubling events are 
common in human cancer, likely occur in cells that are already 
aneuploid, and influence pathways of tumor progression (for 
example, with recessive inactivation of NF1 being less common 
after genome doubling). ABSOLUTE will facilitate the design 
of clinical sequencing studies and studies of cancer genome 
evolution and intra-tumor heterogeneity.
Defining chromosome copy number and allele ratios is fundamental 
to understanding the structure and history of the cancer genome. 
Current genomic characterization techniques measure somatic 
alterations in a cancer sample in units of genomes (DNA mass). 
The meaning of such measurements is dependent on the tumor’s 
purity and its overall ploidy; they are hence complicated to inter­
pret and compare across samples. Ideally, copy number should be 
measured in copies per cancer cell. Such measurements are straight­
forward to interpret and, for alterations that are fixed in the cancer 
cell population, are simple integer values. This is considerably more 
challenging than measuring relative copy number in units of diploid 
DNA mass in a tumor-derived sample.
Measuring somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) on a rela­
tive basis is straightforward using microarrays1–5 or massively paral­
lel sequencing technology6,7; it has been the standard approach for 
copy-number analysis since the development of comparative genomic 
hybridization (CGH)8.
Inferring absolute copy number is more difficult for three reasons: 
(i) cancer cells are nearly always intermixed with an unknown frac­
tion of normal cells (tumor purity); (ii) the actual DNA content of the 
cancer cells (ploidy), resulting from gross numerical and structural 
chromosomal abnormalities, is unknown9–13; and (iii) the cancer cell 
population may be heterogeneous, perhaps owing to ongoing subclonal 
evolution14,15. In principle, one could infer absolute copy numbers by 
rescaling relative data on the basis of cytological measurements of DNA 
mass per cancer cell16–18, or by single-cell sequencing approaches15. 
However, such approaches are not suited to support initial large-scale 
efforts to comprehensively characterize the cancer genome19.
We began focusing on this issue several years ago, initially devel­
oping ad hoc techniques20,21. We subsequently developed the fully 
quantitative ABSOLUTE method and applied it to several cancer 
genome analysis projects, including The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) project. ABSOLUTE provides a foundation for integrative 
genomic analysis of cancer genome alterations on an absolute (cel­
lular) basis. We used these methods to correlate purity and ploidy 
estimates with expression subtypes and to develop statistical power 
calculations and use them to select well-powered samples for whole-
genome sequencing in several published22–24, and numerous ongoing 
projects, including breast, prostate and skin cancer genome charac­
terization. Recently, we extended ABSOLUTE to infer the multiplicity 
of somatic point-mutations in integer allelic units per cancer cell.
Our purpose here is to (i) present the mathematical inference 
framework of the ABSOLUTE method, as well as experimental vali­
dation of its predictions; (ii) apply it to analyze a large pan-cancer 
data set, enabling characterization of the incidence and timing of 
whole-genome doublings during tumor evolution; and (iii) describe 
Absolute quantification of somatic DNA alterations in 
human cancer

an ­integrated analysis of point-mutation and copy-number estimates 
and its application to ovarian carcinoma.
We describe three key mathematical features of ABSOLUTE. First, 
it jointly estimates tumor purity and ploidy directly from observed 
relative copy profiles (point mutations may also be used, if available). 
Second, because joint estimation may not be fully determined on a 
single sample, it uses a large and diverse sample collection to help 
resolve ambiguous cases. Third, it attempts to account for subclonal 
copy-number alterations and point mutations, which are expected in 
heterogeneous cancer samples.
We apply ABSOLUTE to conduct the first, to our knowledge, large-
scale ‘pan-cancer’ analysis of copy-number alterations on an absolute 
basis, across 3,155 cancer samples, representing 25 diseases with at least 
20 samples each. The analysis reveals that whole-genome doubling 
events occur frequently during tumorigenesis, ultimately resulting in 
mature cancers descended from doubled cells bearing complex karyo­
types. Despite evidence that genome doublings can result in genetic 
instability and accelerate oncogenesis13,25,26, the incidence and timing 
of such events had not been broadly characterized in human cancer.
We then describe how estimates of tumor purity and absolute copy 
number allow us to analyze allelic-fraction values (the fraction of 
non-reference sequencing reads supporting a mutation)  to distin­
guish clonal and subclonal point mutations, and to detect macro­
scopic subclonal structure in an ovarian cancer sample. Clonal events 
may be classified as homozygous or heterozygous in the cancer cells, 
guiding interpretation of their function. In addition, the ability to 
quantify integer multiplicity of point mutations aids in the relative 
timing of segmental DNA copy-number gains, as multiplicity values 
of greater than one imply that the point mutation preceded copy gain 
of the locus. Controlling for tumor purity and local copy-number 
allow such timings to be calculated more generally than in the special 
case of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity27. Finally, our data allow 
characterization of somatic cancer evolution with respect to whole-
genome doubling, which we demonstrate in ovarian carcinoma and 
associate with clinicopathological values.

Figure 1  Overview of tumor DNA analysis using ABSOLUTE. (a) A constant 
mass of DNA is extracted from a heterogeneous cell population consisting 
of cancer and normal cells. This DNA is profiled using either microarray or 
massively parallel sequencing technology, giving a genome-wide profile of 
DNA concentrations. (b) Genome-wide view of homologous copy ratios for 
a lung adenocarcinoma tumor sample processed using ABSOLUTE. The 
copy ratios for both homologous chromosomes are shown for each genomic 
segment with locally constant copy number. Color axis indicates distance 
between low (blue) and high (red) homologue concentration; segments 
where these are similar (allelic balance) are purple. (c) Homologous copy-
ratio histogram. Copy ratios shown in b were binned at 0.04 resolution 
(y axis); the length of each block corresponds to the (haploid) genomic 
fraction (x axis) of each corresponding segment in b.  Several discrete 
SCNA peaks are visible, each corresponding either to an (unknown) integer 
copy state in the somatic clone or to a subclonal alteration. (d) To aid in 
the interpretation of potentially ambiguous data, ABSOLUTE uses pre-
computed statistical models of recurrence cancer karyotypes (left, Online 
Methods). Optionally, if somatic point mutation data are available (from 
sequencing of the DNA), then the allelic fractions (fraction of sequencing 
reads bearing the nonreference allele) of these mutations may be used help 
to interpret the DNA concentrations. (e) Three potential interpretations of 
the copy-ratio histogram (b) in terms of absolute copy numbers. Horizontal 
dotted lines indicate the copy ratios corresponding to the indicated 
absolute somatic copy-numbers. (f) Purity (fraction of tumor nuclei) and 
cancer-genome ploidy values corresponding to each interpretation in (e). 
Dotted lines denote potential solutions that share either b, the copy ratio 
associated with zero somatic copies (from upper left to lower right), or δτ, 
the spacing between consecutive integer copy levels (from lower left 
to upper right).  Candidate solutions lie on the indicated grid of 
b = 2(1 – α)/D and  δτ = α/D (equation (1)). (g) The log-likelihood (score) of 
each solution in terms of the SCNA fit of the observed copy ratios to integer 
absolute copy numbers and plausibility of the proposed karyotype. The 
highest-scoring solution (green) is identified by the combination of SCNA-fit 
and karyotype log-likelihood values. This interpretation implies subclonal 
gain of chromosome 2 (e, arrow). The SCNA score alone cannot distinguish 
between this and an additional solution (blue), in which the arrowed region 
is closer to an integer copy state, but the overall SCNA-fit score is equivalent 
to that of the first solution. (h) Interpretation of somatic DNA alterations on 
an absolute scale. Modeled SCNA copy states are shown (left). In addition, 
allelic fractions may be reinterpreted as average allelic copies per cancer cell 
(multiplicity), potentially revealing subclonal point mutations (right).

information on absolute copy number per cancer cell is lost. The pur­
pose of ABSOLUTE is to infer this information from the population 
of mixed DNA. This process begins with the generation of segmented 
copy-number data, which is input to the ABSOLUTE algorithm together 
with precomputed models of recurrent cancer karyotypes and, option­
ally, allelic fraction values for somatic point mutations. The output of 
ABSOLUTE then provides inferred information on the absolute cel­
lular copy number of local DNA segments and, for point mutations, the 
number of mutated alleles (Fig. 1).
We begin by describing the inference framework used in 
ABSOLUTE. Suppose a cancer-tissue sample consists of a mixture of 
a proportion α of cancer cells (assumed to be monogenomic—that 
is, with homogenous SCNAs in the cancer cells) and a proportion 
(1 – α) of contaminating normal (diploid) cells. For each locus x in the 
genome, let q(x) denote the integer copy number of the locus in the 
cancer cells. Let τ denote the mean ploidy of the cancer-cell fraction, 
defined as the average value of q(x) across the genome. In the mixed 
cancer sample, the average absolute copy number of locus x is α q(x) + 
2(1 − α) and the average ploidy (D) is ατ + 2(1 − α), measured in units 
of haploid genomes.
The relative copy number (R) of locus x is therefore:

Because q(x) takes integer values, R(x) takes discrete values. The 
smallest possible value is (2(1 − α)/D), which occurs at homozygously 
deleted loci and corresponds to the fraction of DNA from nor­
mal cells. The spacing between values (α/D) corresponds to the 
­concentration ratio of alleles present at one copy per cancer cell and 
zero copies per normal cell. Notably, if a cancer sample is not strictly 
(1)
(1)
clonal, copy-number alterations occurring in substantial subclonal 
fractions will appear as outliers from this pattern (Fig. 1b,e, arrows). 
Similar considerations have formed the basis for algorithms to 
infer purity and ploidy using allelic copy-ratios derived from single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) microarrays28–33.
We extend absolute copy inference to encompass somatic point 
mutations as follows:

Here, sq represents the multiplicity of the point mutation, in integer 
values per cancer cell (which cannot exceed q(x)), and Ds = αq(x) + 
2(1 − α). The values of F(x) correspond to the expected fraction 
of sequencing reads that support the mutation, which depend on 
the sample purity and absolute somatic copy number at the mutant 
locus, q(x).
The ABSOLUTE algorithm examines possible mappings from rela­
tive to integer copy numbers by jointly optimizing the two parameters α 
and τ (Fig. 1e–g; Supplementary Fig. 1; Online Methods equation (5)). 
In many cases, several such mappings are possible, corresponding to 
multiple optima.
To help resolve ambiguous cases, we used recurrent cancer-
karyotype models based on large data sets (Supplementary Fig. 2; 
Online Methods equation (8) to identify the simplest (that is, most 
common) karyotype that can adequately explain the data. This 
method favors simpler solutions, while preserving the ­flexibility 
to identify unexpected karyotypes given sufficient evidence from 
the copy profile. Indeed, several unusual karyotypes, includ­
ing near-haploid (<1.2n) and hyperaneuploid (>6n) genomes, 
were identified using ABSOLUTE (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Our implementation supports copy-number inference from either total 
or allelic copy-ratio data, such that array-CGH, SNP micro­array or mas­
sively parallel sequencing data may be used. ABSOLUTE is available for 
download at http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/ABSOLUTE.
Validation
We validated the purity and ploidy predictions made by ABSOLUTE 
on Affymetrix SNP microarray data using several approaches: 
(i) direct ploidy measurement of 37 TCGA ovarian carcinoma sam­
ples by fluorescence-activated cell sorting34 (Fig. 2a); (ii) measure­
ment of ploidy for 33 NCI60 cell lines based on spectral karyotyping35 
(Fig. 2b,c); and (iii) DNA-mixing experiments, in which cancer cell 
lines were mixed with paired normal B lymphocyte–derived DNAs in 
varying mass proportions (Fig. 2d, Online Methods). We also evaluated 
a related computational method, ASCAT31, on these data (Fig. 2a–d 
and Supplementary Note). Although the results were broadly concord­
ant with our estimates, ABSOLUTE achieved significantly more accu­
rate results (Fig. 2a–d) on our validation data. Notably, we observed 
an apparent bias by ASCAT to underestimate the cancer cell fraction 
(Fig. 2 c,d), consistent with previous reports applying ASCAT in similar 
mixing experiments using Illumina SNP arrays31  (Fig. S4 therein).
Notably, the purity estimates produced by ABSOLUTE appeared 
to be more accurate for the bulk tumor than those derived from 
­histological examination of frozen tumor sections (Online 
Methods, Fig. 2e). Estimates of the proportion of contaminating 
normal cells for 458 ovarian carcinoma samples34 produced by 
ABSOLUTE were strongly correlated with a molecular signature 
of genomic methylation (Online Methods) seen in leukocytes 
(r2 = 0.59, P < 2.2 × 10−16, Fig. 2e), but only weakly correlated 
with estimates of contamination from histo­logical examination 
(r2 = 0.1, P = 2.4 × 10−12; Online Methods; Fig. 2e x-axis scale, 
Supplementary Fig. 4).
Estimation of tumor purity and ploidy across cancer types
We used ABSOLUTE to analyze allelic copy-ratio profiles derived 
from SNP arrays from 3,155 cancer samples, comprising 2,791 tissue 
specimens and 364 cancer cell lines. This yielded predicted purity 
and ploidy values (Supplementary Table 1) and the segmented abso­
lute allelic copy number of each tumor (Supplementary Table 2). 
The samples came from two TCGA pilot studies describing glio­
blastoma multiforme (GBM; 192 samples)21 and ovarian carci­
noma (488 samples)34, as well as 2,445 profiles incorporated from a 
previous pan-cancer copy-number analysis36 (Online Methods; 
see Supplementary Table 1 for characteristics of each tumor sample). 
A minority of these samples (519 or 16.4%) could not be analyzed 
because they lacked clearly identifiable SCNAs, either because they 
were nearly euploid (nonaberrant), or were excessively contaminated 
with normal cells (insufficient purity) (Fig. 3a). Although sequencing 
data for somatic point mutations may have resolved these cases, such 
data were not available for the majority of samples in this cohort36.

For the 2,636 samples with detectable SCNAs, ABSOLUTE provided 
purity and ploidy calls for 92% of cases, and designated the remain­
ing samples as ‘polygenomic’ (genomically heterogeneous) (Fig. 3a), 
(Online Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5). The fraction of called 
samples varied by disease type, from 34.6% (myeloproliferative dis­
ease; mostly nonaberrant genomes) to 96.7% (ovarian carcinoma; 
100% aberrant genomes), with a median call-rate of 79.2% (Fig. 3a).
The distributions of estimated purity varied among cancer types, 
with the tested lung, esophageal and breast cancer samples being the 
least pure on average in our data set (Fig. 3b). The effect of contami­
nation was readily visible in the copy ratios of impure tumor types 
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Distributions of estimated ploidy (Fig. 3c) 
were qualitatively consistent with those derived from previously 
obtained cytological data for each tumor type13.
Power for detection of somatic point-mutations by sequencing
Both tumor purity and ploidy affect the local depth of sequencing 
necessary to detect point mutations. For example, suppose that a 
region is present at six copies with only one copy carrying a mutation 
in a sample that has 50% contamination with normal cells. In this 
case, only one of eight alleles at this locus (six from the cancer cells 
and two from the normal cells) carry the mutation (Supplementary 
Fig. 7a). We therefore expect that the mutation will be observed 
in only 12.5% of reads. Given this allelic fraction, local sequence 
­coverage of 33-fold is required to detect the mutation with 80% sen­
sitivity, assuming a sequencing error rate of 10−3 per base and a false-
positive rate controlled at <5 × 10−7 (Online Methods, equation (9); 
Supplementary Fig. 7b).
Using ABSOLUTE’s estimates of purity and genome-wide inte­
ger copy numbers, we can calculate the required coverage for pow­
ered detection of mutations present at specified allelic multiplicity 
per cancer cell. Similar considerations apply to detecting subclonal 
mutations, present in a fraction of cancer cells, by using fractional 
multiplicities (Supplementary Fig. 7c). We note that consideration of 
tumor purity in units of cells, rather than DNA fraction, is preferred 
for devising power calculations for sequencing experiments, because 
many somatic alterations of interest are expected to occur at a single 
copy per cancer cell.
We analyzed the distribution of purity and ploidy values in cancer 
samples analyzed for allelic copy number21,34,36 to determine an appro­
priate depth of sequencing coverage needed to detect clonal mutations 
with power 0.8 in each sample. For this purpose, we calculated the 
number of reads needed to detect a mutation present in one copy, at a 
locus present at the average copy number, given the sample’s purity. (One 
could alternatively choose a particular percentile on the copy-number 
distribution.) For such a locus, we found that 30× local coverage would 
suffice for most samples (Supplementary Fig. 7d). By contrast, a locus of 
average copy number with a mutation carried in a subclone at 0.2 cancer-
cell fraction would require coverage of ~100-fold to allow detection in 
about half of the samples (Supplementary Fig. 7e). Using these calcu­
lations and the distribution of local coverage along the genome (which 
depends on the specific sequencing technology), one can determine the 
average coverage necessary to obtain sufficient power in a predefined 
fraction of the genome (e.g., >80% power in >80% of the genome).
We then examined whole-exome sequencing data (~150 × average 
coverage) from 214 TCGA ovarian carcinoma samples34 to determine 
whether detection power was related to the number of mutations 
actually observed. For each sample, we calculated the proportion of 
loci for which the local coverage provided at least 80% power to detect 
mutations present at single copy in a subclone present at 0.05 cancer-
cell fraction. Those samples with the lowest proportion of such well-
powered loci tended to be those in which the fewest such mutations 
were detected (r2 = 0.24, P = 2.7 × 10−13; Supplementary Fig. 7f), 
suggesting that the failure to find such mutations was due to the lack 
of power. This result also demonstrates the importance of power cal­
culations for characterization of the subclonal frequency spectrum.
Multiplicity analysis of somatic point-mutations
We next used ABSOLUTE to convert the allelic fraction of muta­t­
ions to cellular multiplicity estimates. For this purpose, we examined

29,268 somatic mutations identified in whole-exome hybrid capture 
Illumina ­ sequencing37 data from 214 ovarian carcinoma tumor-
normal pairs34 (Fig. 4a). Tumor purity, ploidy and absolute copy-
number values were obtained from Affymetrix SNP6.0 hybridiza­
tion data on the same DNA aliquot that was sequenced, allowing the 
rescaling of allelic fractions to units of multiplicity (Fig. 4a,b; Online 
Methods, equation (12)).
This procedure identified pervasive subclonal point-mutations in 
ovarian carcinoma samples. Although many of the mutations were 
clustered around integer multiplicities, a substantial fraction occurred 
at multiplicities substantially less than one copy per average cancer 
cell, consistent with subclonal multiplicity (Fig. 4b)).
Several lines of evidence support the validity of these subclonal 
mutations, including Illumina resequencing of an independent whole-
genome amplification aliquot, which confirmed both their presence 
(Supplementary Fig. 8a,b), and that their allelic fractions corre­
sponded to subclonal multiplicity values (Supplementary Fig. 8c,d). 
In addition, the mutation spectrum seen for clonal and subclonal muta­
tions was similar (root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.04, Fig. 4c), 
consistent with a common mechanism of origin. Power calculations 
showed that these samples were at least 80% powered for detection of 
subclonal mutations occurring in cancer-cell fractions ranging from 
0.1 to 0.53, with a median of 0.19 (Supplementary Fig. 7e).
The distribution of subclonal multiplicity was similar in the major­
ity of samples (Fig. 4b); it rapidly increased at the sample-specific 
detection limit and then decreased in a manner approximated by 
an exponential decay in the multiplicity range of 0.05 to 0.5 when 
pooling across all samples. In contrast, the high-grade serous ovarian 
carcinoma (HGS-OvCa) sample TCGA-24-1603 (Fig. 4d–f) showed 
evidence for discrete ‘macroscopic subclones’. Rescaling of subclonal 
SCNAs (Fig. 4d) and point mutations (Fig. 4e) to units of cancer cell 
fraction (Fig. 4f) revealed discrete clusters near fractions 0.2, 0.3 
and 0.6 (Fig. 4f), implying the alterations within each cluster likely 
co-occurred in the same cancer cells. We note that this combination 
of cell fractions sums to more than one, implying that at least one of 
the detected subclones was nested inside another.
We next used ABSOLUTE to analyze the multiplicity of both the 
reference and alternate alleles in order to classify point mutations 
as either heterozygous or homozygous in the affected cell fraction 
(Fig. 5a–c). We considered 15 genes with mutations recently identi­
fied in these data34, including five known tumor suppressor genes 
and five oncogenes (Fig. 5d). The frequency of homozygous muta­
tions in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes was signifi­
cantly different, with a significantly elevated fraction of homozygous 
mutations in the tumor suppressor genes (P = 0.006, Fig. 5d) and no 
homozygous mutations in the oncogenes (P = 0.012, Fig. 5d). This 
result provides evidence supporting CDK12 as a candidate tumor sup­
pressor gene in ovarian carcinoma34, since 7 of 12 CDK12 mutations 
were homozygous (P = 6.5 × 10−5; Fig. 5d).
Overall, TP53 had among the greatest fraction of clonal, homozygous 
and ‘multiplicity >1’ mutations of any gene in the coding exome 
(Fig. 5e), demonstrating the clear identification of a key initiating event 
in HGS-OvCa carcinogenesis38 directly from ­multiplicity analysis.
Whole-genome doubling occurs frequently in human cancer
For many cancer types, the distribution of total copy number (ploidy) 
was markedly bi-modal (Fig. 3c), consistent with chromosome-count 
profiles derived from SKY10,13. Although these results are consistent 
with whole-genome doubling during their somatic evolution, it has 
been difficult to rule out the alternative hypothesis that evolution 
of high-ploidy karyotypes results from a process of successive 
partial amplifications12.
To study genome doublings, we used homologous copy-number 
information—that is, the copy numbers, bi and ci, of the two homo­
logous chromosome segments at each locus. By looking at the dis­
tributions of bi and ci across the genome, we could draw inferences 
regarding genome doubling. Immediately following genome dou­
bling, both bi and ci would be even numbers. Following the loss of a 
single copy of a region, the larger of bi and ci will remain even, but 
the smaller would become odd. In fact, when we looked at high-
ploidy samples, we discerned that the higher of bi and ci was usually 
even throughout the genome, consistent with their having arisen by

doubling of the entire genome (Supplementary Fig. 9). Using simu­
lations, we found that the observed profiles were unlikely to arise 
owing to SCNAs occurring in serial fashion at multiple independent 
chromosomes (P < 10–3).
Using such information, we classified samples into three groups, 
which we interpreted as corresponding to 0, 1 and >1 genome doubling 
events in the clonal evolution of the cancer. These three groups had 
modal ploidy values of 1.75, 2.75 and 4.0, respectively (Fig. 6a), and 
also segregated into three clusters by ploidy and mean homologous 
copy-number imbalance (Fig. 6b). We interpreted this as evidence 
of SNCAs occurring with net losses, interspersed with the genome 
doublings. This process resulted in intermediate ploidy values for the 
doubled clones (2.2–3.4n), with pervasive imbalance of homologous 
chromosomes (Fig. 6b).
The frequency of genome doubling varied across tumor types 
(Fig. 6c), reflecting differences in disease-specific biology and 
clinical progression status. Hematopoietic neoplasms (myelopro­
liferative disease, acute lymphoblastic leukemia) had nearly no 
doubling events, whereas glioblastoma multiforme, renal cell car­
cinoma, prostate cancer, various sarcomas, hepatocellular carci­
noma and medulloblastoma all had ~25% incidence of doubling. 
Genome doubling was more ­ common in epithelial cancers, 
with colorectal, breast, lung, ovarian and esophageal cancers all 
having >50% incidence of doubling (Fig. 6c). Esophageal adeno­
carcinoma had the greatest doubling incidence, consistent with pre­
vious reports of frequent 4n populations at various stages of Barrett’s 
esophagus progression39,40.
Specific aneuploidies precede genome doubling
We then used ABSOLUTE to infer the temporal order of genome 
doubling in tumorigenesis, relative to SNCAs involving specific 
­chromosome arms. In many cancer types, the fixation of arm-level 
SCNAs was inferred to occur before genome doubling, because both 
doubled and nondoubled samples had similar frequencies of specific 
arm-level SNCAs (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 10).
In glioblastoma multiforme samples, loss of heterozygosity involv­
ing chromosomes 9 and 10, and gains of chromosome 7 occurred at 
equivalent frequencies (Fig. 6d), demonstrating that the most com­
mon broad SCNAs in glioblastoma multiforme occur before genome 
doubling. Gain of chromosomes 19 and 20 was nearly exclusive to 
nondoubled samples, and several arms had greater frequency of loss 
of heterozygosity in doubled samples (Fig. 6d), suggesting that addi­
tional biological differences underlie these samples.
Because ABSOLUTE could not distinguish between ploidy 2N and 
4N in cases with no observed SCNAs, we discarded such nonaberrant 
samples from our analysis (Fig. 3a). For many tumor types, such cases 
were rare, due to the tendency for chromosomal losses after doubling 
(Figs. 3c and 6a,b and Supplementary Fig. 9). The representation of 
specific cancer subtypes may be biased by differences in ascertain­
ment, however.
In contrast to broad chromosomal alterations, focal SCNA events 
occurred at greater frequency in doubled genomes (Fig. 6e). Consistent 
with previous reports36,41,42, the observed frequency of focal SCNAs as 
a function of their length (L) followed power-law scaling: P(L) ∝ L−α, 
for L > 0.5 Mb (Fig. 6e). Genome doubling was associated with a larger 
overall number of SCNAs; however, we obtained estimates of α near 
1 for each group (Fig. 6e), suggesting that the mechanism(s) by which 
they were generated did not greatly depend on ploidy.
Genome doubling influences progression of ovarian carcinoma
We next sought to correlate whole-genome doubling occurrence in 
high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with other genetic and clini­
cal features. Genome-doubled samples showed a higher incidence of 
heterozygous mutations, but correcting for sample ploidy removed 
this effect (Fig. 7a), suggesting that the per-base mutation rates are 
equivalent. Clonal mutations at multiplicity >1 were approximately 
tenfold more ­prevalent in doubled samples; many of these events 
likely occurred before the doubling event. Genome-doubled samples 
had significantly lower frequencies of both of homozygous deletions 
(Fig. 7b) and of clonal homozygous mutations (Fig. 7c). We expect

defined as 0 homologous copies. Amplification 
was defined as >1 homologous copy for samples 
with 0 genome doublings, and as >2 homologous 
copies for those with 1 genome doubling. Calls 
were made based on the modal allelic copy 
numbers of each chromosome arm. Dashed 
lines indicate y = x. (e) SCNAs, defined as 
regions differing from the modal absolute 
copy number of each sample, were binned at 
adaptive resolution to maintain 200 SCNAs per 
bin, and renormalized by bin length. The value in each bin was further divided by the number of tumor samples in each genome doubling class, indicated 
by color as in a. The black line indicates slope = −1. Linear regression models were fit independently for each class using SCNAs 0.5 < x < 20 Mb. 
This resulted in fitted slope values of −1.05, −0.96 and −0.88 for 0, 1 and >1 genome doublings, respectively (data not shown).

A n a ly s i s
that many of the observed homozygous alterations in the doubled 
samples were fixed before genome doubling.
The lower incidence of homozygous mutations in genome-doubled 
samples may reflect the fact that more events are required to render 
a mutation homozygous in a genome-doubled sample (although the 
effect may be partially offset by a possible increase in genetic instabil­
ity following doubling, for example, by centrosome duplication43). 
These considerations suggest that genome-doubled samples evolve 
by means of distinct trajectories, because inactivation of tumor sup­
pressors may occur less frequently after doubling.
We note that 13 of the 15 detected point mutations in the tumor 
suppressor NF1 occurred in the 93 ovarian samples that had not 
undergone genome doubling (P = 0.002; Fisher’s exact test), and 
these mutations were uniformly homozygous (data not shown). This 
is consistent with selection for recessive inactivation of NF1, a typical 
pattern for a tumor suppressor gene. It also suggests that nongenome-
doubled ovarian carcinoma samples evolved through a distinct trajec­
tory, rather than being precursors to doubled samples. If not, many 
NF1 mutations would be homozygous with multiplicity >1 in doubled 
samples, as is seen for TP53.
Finally, we noted that genome-doubled samples were associ­
ated with a significant increase in the age at pathological diagno­
sis (Fig. 7d) and with a significantly greater incidence of cancer 
recurrence (Fig. 7e).
DISCUSSION
Here we report the development of a reliable, high-throughput 
method to infer absolute homologous copy numbers from tumor-
derived DNA samples, as well as multiplicity values of point mutations 
(ABSOLUTE). It may be possible to extend ABSOLUTE to other types 
of genomic alterations, such as structural rearrangements and small 
insertions and deletions, although this may require longer sequence 
reads to ensure accurate sequence alignment.
ABSOLUTE analysis of SCNAs demonstrated that many of the 
copy-number alterations analyzed were fixed in the cancer lineage 
represented in the sample (Fig. 3). This was recapitulated in ovarian 
cancer by somatic point-mutations, many of which were fixed at integer 
multiplicity (Fig. 4b). Classification of point mutations based on their 
multiplicities may help distinguish tumor suppressors and oncogenes 
(Fig. 5d). Knowledge of discrete tumor copy-states, subclonal structure 
and genome doubling status provides a foundation for further recon­
struction of the phylogenetic relationships within a cancer and the 
temporal sequence by which a given cancer genome arose44–46.
ABSOLUTE provides a tool for the design of studies using genomic 
sequencing to detect variant alleles in cancer tissue samples, based on 
calculation of sensitivity to detect mutations as a function of sample 
purity, local copy number and sequencing depth (Supplementary Fig. 7). 
The high accuracy of tumor purity and ploidy estimates produced by 
ABSOLUTE, based on SNP microarray data (Fig. 2), makes it possible to 
determine the sequencing depth required for a given sample or to select 
suitable samples given a fixed sequencing depth. Such considerations are 
vital to the interpretation of subclonal point-mutations (Supplementary 
Figs. 7f and 10).
Analysis of the predicted absolute allelic copy-number profiles 
across human cancers produced by ABSOLUTE shed new light on can­
cer genome evolution. The observed SCNA profiles (Supplementary 
Fig. 9) were consistent with a common trajectory consisting of an 
early period of chromosomal instability followed by the emergence 
of a stable aneuploid clone, as previously described11. Our data fur­
ther indicate that genome doublings occur in a subset of cancer cells 
already harboring arm-level SCNAs characteristic of the correspond­
ing tumor type. The genomes of these cancers were therefore shaped 
by selection at chromosomal arm-level resolution before doubling and 
further clonal outgrowth (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 10).
These findings are broadly consistent with an earlier interpreta­
tion of primary breast cancer FACS/SKY profiles47, and has recently 
been recapitulated in studies of macro-dissected and ploidy-sorted cell 
populations14, and single-cell sequencing15 of primary breast tumors. 
We note that this model represents a departure from the idea that tetra­
ploidization is an initiating event13,26,48–50. In addition, the association 
of genome doubling with epithelial lineage (Fig. 6c) and with age at 
diagnosis in ovarian carcinoma (Fig. 7d) is consistent with a recently 
described mechanism linking telomere crisis, DNA damage response, 
and genome doubling in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts49.
The analysis of clonality presented in this work offers a path for­
ward for clinical sequencing of cancer, and provides the means to 
address recently reported concerns regarding intratumor heterogene­
ity14,15,45,46,51–53. Analysis using ABSOLUTE can identify alterations 
present in all cancer cells contributing to the DNA aliquot (Fig. 1), 
even if such clonal alterations correspond to the minority of observed 
mutations. Such alterations are candidate founding oncogenic drivers 
for a given cancer, which may be the preferred therapeutic targets. 
Further characterization of subclonal somatic alterations in cancer 
may become important for understanding variable response to tar­
geted therapeutics, with the clonality of targeted mutations potentially 
affecting response level.

ONLINE METHODS
Inference of purity, ploidy, and absolute somatic copy-numbers. Homologue-
specific copy ratios (HSCRs; copy-ratio estimates of both homologous chromo­
somes) are preferred for analysis with ABSOLUTE, and were used for all analyses 
in this study. Although ABSOLUTE can be run on total copy-ratio data (e.g. from 
array CGH or low-pass sequencing data), we do not present such results here. The 
use of HSCRs reduces the ambiguity of copy profiles. For example, the total copy-
ratio profile of a sample without SCNAs would be equivalent for ploidy values of 
1,2,3, etc., however the HSCR profile would rule out odd ploidy values, since these 
would not be consistent with equal homologous copy-numbers. In addition, since 
subclonal SCNAs will generally affect only one of the two HSCR values in a given 
genomic segment, the ratio of clonal to subclonal SCNAs genome-wide is gener­
ally higher when considering HSCRs rather than only total copy-numbers.
HSCRs were derived from segmental estimates of phased multipoint allelic 
copy-ratios at heterozygous loci using the program HAPSEG54 on data from 
Affymetrix SNP arrays. As part of this procedure, haplotype panels from population 
linkage analysis (HAPMAP3)55 were used in conjunction with statistical phasing 
software (BEAGLE)56 in order to estimate the phased germline genotypes at 
SNP markers in each cancer sample. This increased our sensitivity for resolving 
genotypes, since it naturally exploited the local statistical dependencies between 
SNPs54. In addition, this allowed greater resolution of small differences between 
homologous copy-ratios, since phase information from allelic imbalance of het­
erozygous markers due to SCNA could be combined with the statistical phasing 
from the haplotype panels54.
Identification and evaluation of candidate tumor purity and ploidy ­values. 
We describe identification of candidate tumor purity and ploidy values and 
calculation of their SCNA-fit log-likelihood scores using a probabilistic model. 
This is accomplished by fitting the input HSCR estimates with a Gaussian 
mixture model, with components centered at the discrete concentration-
ratios implied by equation (1). The model also supports a moderate fraction 
of subclonal events which are not restricted to the discrete levels. Candidate 
solutions are identified by searching for local optima of this likelihood over 
a large range of purity and ploidy values. This results in a discrete set of 
candidate solutions with corresponding SCNA-fit likelihoods (equation (1), 
Fig. 1e–g, Supplementary Fig. 1c–e).
The SCNA-fit scores quantify the evidence for each solution contributed by 
explanation of the observed HSCRs as integer SCNAs. These computations are 
independent for each sample. The input data consist of N HSCRs xi, i ∈{1,…, N}. 
Each of these is observed with standard error σi, and corresponds to a genomic 
fraction denoted wi. Each of the xi is assumed to have arisen from either one 
of Q integer copy-number states: Q = {0,1,…,Q − 1}, or an additional state Z 
corresponding to subclonal copy-number. We refer to the collection of possible 
copy-states as S = Q < Z. We define Q + 1 indicators s for the copy-state of 
each segment, with p(si) representing the probability of segment i having been 
generated from state s∈S. The integer copy-states of S are indexed by q ∈Q; the 
non-integer state is denoted by z.
The expected copy-ratio corresponding to each integer copy-number q(x) 
in a tumor sample is given by equation (1). Note that when homologous copy-
ratios are used, this equation becomes:

since HSCRs are measured relative to haploid concentrations, as opposed to 
the diploid values assumed by equation 1. D is related to tumor purity and 
ploidy (α and τ) (equation (1), Fig. 1). The observed xi are modeled with a 
mixture of Q Gaussian components located at µ = {µq ∈Q} representing integer 
copy-states Q and an additional uniform component Z. The mixture Z allows 
segments to be assigned non-integer copy values so that subclonal alterations 
or artifacts do not dramatically impact the likelihood.

N and U denote the normal and uniform densities, respectively. The free param­
eter σH represents sample-level noise in excess of the HSCR standard-error 
σi, which might represent a moderate number of related clones in the malignant 
cell population, ongoing genomic instability, or excessive noise due to variable 
experimental conditions. The mixture weights θ = {θs∈S} specify the expected 
genomic fraction allocated to each copy-state. The parameter d represents the 
domain of the uniform density, corresponding to the range of plausible copy-ratio 
values (we used d = 7).
Some complication arises due to the fact that the data consist of copy-ratios 
calculated from a segmentation of the genome. For consistent interpretation, 
the mixture weights P(si|wi, θ) must be calculated for each segment separately, 
taking into account the variable genomic fraction wi. This is accomplished by 
constraining the canonical averages of genomic mass allocated to each copy-
state to match those specified by θ:

Q ∈ Q integer copy-states, corresponding to the copy-ratios (locations) m.
Genome-wide absolute copy-profiles are over-determined with respect to

By definition, this quantity (tˆg) is an alternate estimate of cancer ploidy (note 
an additional factor of 2 is added when HSCRs are used). Because tˆg is a 
weighted average over discrete states in the modeled data, it is expected to be 
more robust to experimental fluctuations that shift or scale the copy-profile 
slightly. Note that, for this computation, the  ˆqij were calculated with ˆqz = 0, 
so that the above expectation is over integer states only.
We verified that these estimates were generally close to the values of 
tˆ obtained by optimization of the SCNA-fit likelihood (RMSE = 0.26, 
Supplementary Fig. 11a). However, we noted a relationship between the level 
of discordance between ploidy estimators and the mean of the calibrated data 
(Supplementary Fig. 11b). Noting that correctly calibrated copy-ratio data 
always has mean = 1, we examined whether the miscalibration was due to scal­
ing bias in the data. We found that this model explained nearly two thirds of the 
discordance between the two estimates (corrected RMSE = 0.09, Supplementary 
Fig. 11c), by which we inferred that scaling biases dominated our miscalibra­
tion. This is significant, as such biases do not effect the estimation of tumor 
purity (Supplementary Fig. 11).
Two additional transformations of the copy-state locations µ are used when 
copy-ratios are measured using microarrays. The first of these accounts for the 
effect of attenuation with an isothermal adsorbtion model7:

Karyotype models. Additional information is generally required in order to 
reliably select the correct tumor purity and ploidy solution from the set of 
candidates identified by fitting the model in (4). In a given tumor sample, 
several combinations of theoretically possible purity, ploidy, and copy number 
values may map to equivalent copy ratios (Fig. 1e–g, Supplementary Fig. 1). 
Furthermore, the presence of subclonal SCNAs may result in a spuriously high 
ploidy solution with an implausible karyotype receiving a greater SCNA-fit 
likelihood by over-discretizing the copy profile, allowing their assignment to 
integer copy-levels (Supplementary Fig. 1c–e).
ABSOLUTE models common cancer karyotypes by grouping tumor sets 
according to similarities in their absolute homologous copy-number profiles 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). These models are constructed directly from the tumor 
data in a ’boot-strapping’ fashion, whereby a subset of tumors with relatively 
unambiguous profiles (e.g., due to high purity values) is used initialize the 
models, iteratively allowing more tumors to be called, etc. Previous cytogenetic 
characterizations of human cancer were used to guide this process13. These 
models enable calculation of a karyotype likelihood, for each candidate purity/
ploidy solution, reflecting the similarity of the corresponding karyotype to 
models associated with the specified disease of the input tumor sample (8). 
Integration of the SCNA-fit and karyotype likelihoods favors robust and unam­
biguous identification of the correct purity and ploidy values in many tumor 
samples ( Fig. 1g, Supplementary Fig. 1e).The selection of a solution imply­
ing a less common karyotype requires greater evidence from the SCNA-fit of 
the copy profile.
Prior knowledge of karyotypes characteristic of a particular disease is 
summarized as a mixture of K multivariate multinomial distributions over 
the integer homologous copy-states Q = [0,7] of each chromosome arm. For 
a given candidate purity and ploidy solution, the corresponding segmental 
copy-state indicators for each segment i, ˆqij, are summarized into estimates of 
the J arm-level homologous copy-numbers, denoted C^. The karyotype log-
likelihood score is calculated as:

tion identifies groups of disease subtypes with similar genomic copy profiles 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Note that copy-states for both homologues of each 
arm are modeled (J = 78). Karyotype scores for samples with only total copy-
ratio data are calculated using convolution of the multinomial probabilities 
for the two homologous chromosomes.

best model was retained.
The models were constructed in a semi-automated fashion by seeding 
with relatively unambiguous copy-profiles. As tumors were added, the use of 
recurrent karyotypes clearly identified the correct solutions of additional 
samples, etc. For example, LOH of chr17 occurs in nearly 100% of ovarian car­
cinoma samples34, allowing the model to learn that solutions implying LOH 
of chr17 are likely to be correct. In total, models for 14 disease types were 
created. Diseases with fewer than 40 samples called by ABSOLUTE were omitted

from this procedure. In addition, a “master” model was created by combining 
called primary cancer profiles. This model was used for diseases with no specific 
karyotype model.
Limitations of joint purity/ploidy inference from copy-profile data. 
Accurate calibration of both the SCNA-fit and karyotype models to the true 
level of certainty implied by the data would allow for assignment of prob­
abilities to each candidate solution; we do not believe that the models we 
have presented here sufficiently capture the complexity of cancer genomes 
to allow for such interpretations. Even with manual review, analysis with 
ABSOLUTE may occasionally result in incorrect interpretations, for exam­
ple genome-doubling without subsequent detectable gains or losses would 
result in a solution implying half the true ploidy value, which in some cases 
may correspond to a plausible karyotype model. Alternately, when multiple 
subclonal SCNAs appear close to the midpoints between adjacent clonal 
peaks, a solution implying twice the true ploidy may be chosen. We note 
that samples with no reliably detected SCNAs could not be called in our 
framework (ploidy 2n or 4n; purity undetermined). Such samples were 
therefore excluded from downstream analysis (see below). Estimation of 
inference error-rate requires independent measurement of sample ploidy. 
Further validation experiments in diverse tumor types will help to clarify 
any disease specific caveats.
We note that the use of somatic mutation allelic-fractions, combined with 
the SCNA copy-ratios, generally allows for increased sensitivity for samples 
with few SCNAs. In addition, the mutation data helps distinguish genome-
doubling ambiguity in purity/ploidy estimation, although it does not inform 
ambiguities of the type b′ = b + 2(1–α)/D (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 1d, 
equation (1)). Thus, combined analysis generally facilitates obtaining higher 
call-rates using ABSOLUTE (not shown).
Fortunately, many samples in our pan-cancer SNP array dataset were con­
sistent with frequent SCNA both before and after genome doubling, enabling 
unambiguous inference for many samples without use of somatic point-
mutation data. This aspect of cancer genome evolution was noted previously in 
breast cancer cytogenetic data47. We note that manual review of ABSOLUTE 
results was performed prior to generation of the FACS validation data or analy­
sis of the NCI60 cell-line ploidy estimates (Fig. 2a,b).
Identification of samples refractory to purity/ploidy inference. In order to 
facilitate rapid analysis of many cancer samples used in this study, ABSOLUTE 
was programed to automatically identify copy profiles that cannot be reli­
ably called and to classify them into informative failure categories (Fig. 3a), 
which were defined by the following criteria. Define mˆ as the sorted vector 
of posterior genome-wide copy-state allocations ( )
qˆ , so that m1
ˆ  represents 
the greatest element of qˆ  (the modal copy-state). This vector was constructed 
with θ0 replaced by 0 if θ0 <0.01 and b < 0.15, so that germline copy-number 
variants (CNVs) or regions of inherited homozygosity are not confused with 
small SCNAs implying very pure samples. The categories are then:

These criteria were applied to the top-ranked mode for each sample (combined 
SCNA-fit and karyotype scores). Several examples of each outcome are shown 
in Supplementary Figure 5. The above designations led to reasonably good 
concordance of automated calls with those obtained after manual review. We 
note that the use of somatic point-mutation data increases the calling sensitiv­
ity within these sample categories.
Cancer cell-line DNA mixing experiment. DNA extracted from two can­
cer cell lines (HCC38, HCC1143) was mixed with DNA from matched 
B-lymphocyte cell lines (HCC38BL, HCC1143BL) in various proportions, and 
hybridized to Affymetrix 250 K Sty SNP arrays. Stock DNA aliquots were 
created for each cell-line by normalization of DNA concentration to 50 ng/µl. 
Mixing of cancer and matched B-lymphocyte DNA to each required mixing 
fraction was done by volume.
FACS analysis of primary tumor samples. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-
embedded blocks from ovarian serous carcinoma cases were available from 
tumor-sections corresponding to the frozen blocks from which DNA-aliquots 
were obtained for SNP-array hybridization. Multiple curls containing at least 
70% tumor cell nuclei were cut to an aggregate thickness of 150 µm. Sections 
were disaggregated and labeled with propidium iodide (DNA stain). FACS was 
performed to determine ploidy.
Determination of tumor purity via pathology review. Frozen ovarian serous 
cystadenocarcinoma specimens were collected from multiple hospital tissue 
banks and maintained frozen in liquid nitrogen vapors. A tissue portion was 
created with two flanking H&E slides (arbitrarily named top and bottom) as 
follows: tissues were mounted in optimal cutting temperature media (OCT) 
and brought to −20 °C. A 4 µm frozen section (top slide) was cut with a 
cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). A specimen for molecular 
extraction was created by shaving 100 mg of tumor tissue from the tissue face 
with a scalpel, then a second 4 µm frozen section was cut (bottom slide). An 
H&E stain was conducted on both slide tissue sections using an Autostainer 
XL with integrated coverslipper (Leica). Digital images of slides were created 
at 20× resolution using a Scanscope XT (Aperio, Vista, CA, USA). Board-
certified pathologists conducted the pathology review remotely via ImageScope 
software (Aperio). Pathologists initially reviewed each slide at low magnifica­
tion to determine low power microscopic morphology, then increased mag­
nification to 20× and reviewed 10 representative high power fields on each 
slide. Diagnosis of ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma was verified, and tumor 
purity was determined as the proportion of tumor nuclei present compared 
to the total nuclei present on the slide. The tumor purity of the extracted 
specimen was calculated as the average purity score of the top and bottom 
slides. Quality control included a random review of 10% of slides by a second 
pathologist to verify consistency of reads.
Leukocyte methylation signature. DNA methylation data for 489 high stage, 
high grade serous ovarian tumors and eight normal fallopian tube samples 
was obtained from http://tcga.cancer.gov/dataportal/. In addition, buffy coat 
samples from two female individuals were obtained. All data were generated 
with Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 arrays, which interrogate 27,578 
CpG sites located in proximity to the transcription start sites of 14,475 con­
sensus coding sequencing in the NCBI Database (Genome Build 36). The level 
of DNA methylation at each probe was summarized with beta values ranging 
from 0 (unmethylated) to 1 (methylated)59.
The leukocyte methylation signature was derived as follows. Each probe was 
ranked by the difference in mean beta value in buffy coat and fallopian tube 
samples. We retained the 100 probes with the largest positive difference and 
the 100 with the largest negative difference between mean DNA methylation in 
normal fallopian tube tissues and peripheral blood leukocytes, designated BC 
and FT (buffy coat and fallopian tube enriched, respectively). Let Tik denote the 
beta value for probe k in tumor sample i. Let Bk denote the average beta value of 
buffy coat samples for each probe. Let Tk denote the minimum observed beta 
value across all tumor samples for the BC probes and the maximum for the 
FT probes. Denote by fB the fraction of buffy coat components in the sample, 
then we have the following equation for each probe: T

Selection of data sets. We analyzed 2,445 Affymetrix 250 K Sty SNP samples 
from a previous pan cancer survey36 containing 3,131 cancer samples. Because 
our processing of the data required use of the Birdseed algorithm60, external 
data sets lacking diploid PCR controls could not be used. In addition, cancer 
types with fewer than 20 samples were excluded. In addition, 680 Affymetrix 
SNP6.0 samples were taken from the TCGA GBM21 and HGS-OvCa34 
studies, as well as 30 cell-line samples, bringing total sample count to 
3,155. The complete table of cancer samples analyzed is available as 
Supplementary Table 1. The complete table of ABSOLUTE results is available 
as Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.
Power calculation for somatic mutation detection in cancer tissue samples. 
We develop a framework for calculation of statistical power for the detection of 
mutations. Power to detect a variant depends on the allelic fraction f and local 
depth of coverage n. To calculate power, we model the idealized scenario in 
which random sequencing errors occur uniformly with rate ∈. We calculate a 
minimum number of supporting reads k such that the probability of observing 
k or more identical non-reference reads due to sequencing error is less than a 
defined false-positive rate (FPR):

We consider the case of detecting clonal somatic variants present at a single 
copy per cancer cell in cancer-tissue derived DNA samples. Given estimates 
of purity (α) and local absolute copy-number (qt), the allelic fraction of such 
variants is: 
d
a
a
a
=
−
+
2 1(
)
qt
Power is calculated in such cases as Pow(n,δ).
In order to simplify the relationship between power and tumor purity/
ploidy for presentation in Supplementary Figure 7, we considered the detec­
tion power of the expected locus, over the genome-wide copy average. Power 
as such is determined by the sample allelic index δτ = α/D, which is solely a 
function of tumor purity/ploidy (equation 1). Expected power is obtained by 
using allelic fraction f = δτ in equation (9). This calculation differs only in the 
substitution of expected genomic copy-number, i.e. ploidy (τ), for the local 
copy-number qt in equation (10).
Power for expected subclonal variants present in fraction sf of cancer 
cells is given by Pow(n,sfδτ). This calculation was used for Supplementary 
Figure 7c,e. Local copy calculations using Pow(n,sfδ) were used for 
Supplementary Figures 7f and 12.
Detection of somatic point mutations in ovarian carcinoma. We analyzed 
whole-exome hybrid capture Illumina sequencing (WES)37 data from 214 ovarian 
carcinoma tumor-normal pairs previously analyzed by the TCGA consortium34. 
We used the program muTect (K. Cibulskis et al., in preparation) We have used 
a newer version of the program muTect than used in previous analysis of this

data34. The primary improvement in the new version is a reduction in the prior 
that somatic mutations be at an allelic fraction of 0.5, allowing greater sensitivity 
at low allelic-fraction mutations, such as clonal events in impure samples, or to 
subclonal mutations. This procedure resulted in 29,268 somatic mutations.
Inference of point mutation multiplicity. We develop a probabilistic model 
for inference of the integer multiplicities for both germline and somatic 
variants, based on knowledge of tumor purity and genome-wide absolute 
copy-numbers. Denote the absolute homologous copy-numbers at a mutant 
locus as q1 and q2, with q1 ≤ q2. The possible multiplicities of germline vari­
ants are then: 
gq = {
,
,
}
q q
qt
1
2
where qt = q1 + q2. Under the assumption that all somatic point-mutations arise 
uniquely on a single haplotype, the possible multiplicities are: 
sq = { ,
,
}
1
2
… q
Note that when only total copy-ratio data are available, q2 above is unknown, 
and qt is used instead.
Germline mutations are generally present in both the cancer and normal 
cell populations, with somatic copy-number alterations affecting the allelic 
fraction. A heterozygous variant in the germline, with multiplicity gq in the 
cancer genome, has allelic fraction:

whereas the allelic fraction of homozygous germline variants is 1 regardless

sq is fsq = sqδ, with δ as in equation (10).
Consider an observed somatic point-mutation of unknown copy sq ∈ sq, 
observed allelic fraction fˆ, and with n total reads covering the locus. The 
complete likelihood of fˆmay be represented as a mixture of Beta distribu­
tions corresponding to each element of sq, plus an additional component S

For the computations in this study, we fixed λ = 25, wsq to 0.25, and wsc 
to 0.75, which produced a fit to the combined-sample mutation-fraction 
distribution (Fig. 4b). The results presented in Figure 4 were robust to 
various settings.
Optimization of mixture components weights corresponding to inte­
ger somatic multiplicities may be accomplished in a manner similar to that 
described for the SNCA mixture model in equation (6). A Dirichlet prior may 
be specified as a vector of pseudo-counts equivalent to prior observations of 
each multiplicity value. Weights are then calculated as the mode of the poste­
rior Dirichlet calculated from the observed counts. These computations are 
used to calculate a mutation-score likelihood for each purity ploidy mode when 
ABSOLUTE is run with paired SCNA and somatic point mutation data.
Simulation of cancer-genome evolution to support genome-doubling infer­
ences. A simple simulation was performed to obtain P-values for the prob­
ability that an observed configuration of homologous copy-numbers could be 
produced from a serial process of independent gains and losses. Genome-wide 
homologous copy-numbers are summarized at chromosome-arm resolution as 
integer gains/losses (total of 78 states). We then fix the total number of gains/
losses N for the sample, and calculate rates for each arm, which are normalized to 
probabilities. Simulation of the sample is performed by independently ­sampling 
N gains and losses from these probabilities. This was repeated 1,000 times for 
each sample, keeping track of the number of times M that the extent of even 
high homologous copy-number present in the observed sample was attained or 
exceeded. The P-value is then: P
M
= 1 000

, if M > 0, otherwise P < 0.0001.
