INTRODUCTION: Cancer genome studies
have contributed to the analysis and discovery
of somatic mutations that drive cancer growth.
However, studying the genetic makeup of a
tumor when it is already fully developed limits
our ability to uncover how and which somatic
mutations accumulate in normal tissues in the
stages preceding cancer initiation. To address
this challenge, recent studies performed deep
sequencing in a limited number of tissue types
and a small number of individuals, identifying
a large number of microscopic clones carrying
somatic mutations, some in known cancer
genes. These findings emphasize the need to
uncover the genomic events that occur in all
normal tissues. Although efforts have begun to
collect and analyze DNA from normal tissues,
we still lack a comprehensive catalog of genet-
ic events and clonal properties across a large
number of tissues and individuals. By analyz-
ing the information-rich content in RNA now
available from recent advances in RNA se-
quencing methods, we may be able to sub-
stantially expand the scope and scale of these
studies.
RATIONALE: Some mutations found in the
DNA can be detected in the corresponding
RNA, depending on the mutation allele frac-
tion and sequence coverage. We therefore hy-
pothesized that a careful analysis of RNA
sequences from normal bulk tissues could
uncover somatic mutations reflecting macro-
scopic clones within the samples. In this work,
we used the large collection of RNA sequences
from the Genotype–Tissue
Expression (GTEx) proj-
ect, representing more
than 6700 samples from
~500 individuals, span-
ning across 29 different
normal tissues.
RESULTS: We developed a new method, called
RNA-MuTect, to identify somatic mutations
using a tissue-derived RNA sample and its
matched-normal DNA. We validated RNA-
MuTect on both tumor-adjacent and cancer
samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), wherein DNA and RNA were coex-
tracted from the same samples. Focusing on
mutations contained within sufficiently cov-
ered sequences, RNA-MuTect achieved high
sensitivity and precision, enabling the dis-
covery of most driver events and mutational
processes from TCGA tumor RNA data. When
applied to the GTEx dataset of normal tissues,
multiple somatic mutations were detected in
almost all individuals and tissues studied here,
including in known cancer genes. The three
tissues with the largest number of somatic
mutations were sun-exposed skin, esophagus
mucosa, and lung; this finding suggests that
environmental exposure can promote somatic
mosaicism. Both the individuals’ age and
tissue-specific proliferation rate were found to
be associated with the number of detected
mutations. A dN/dS (ratio of nonsynonymous
to synonymous substitutions) analysis sug-
gested that some of the mutations identified
in cancer genes may confer a selective advan-
tage. In addition, allelic imbalance events at
the chromosome arm level were detected in
normal tissues.
CONCLUSION: Genetic clones carrying soma-
tic mutations are detected across normal tis-
sues to different extents, and these differences
depend on factors such as the tissue’s exposure
to environmental mutagens, natural architec-
ture, proliferation rate, and the microenviron-
ment. Some of these clones may be the result
of genetic drift. Others, however, may develop
as a result of positive selection driven by certain
somatic events, thus potentially representing
the earliest stages of tumorigenesis. Higher-
resolution studies of normal tissues and pre-
cancerous lesions are required if we are to
advance our understanding of both aging and
early cancer development.▪

Somatic clonal expansions in normal human tissues. RNA sequences from 29 normal
human tissues collected as part of the Genotype–Tissue Expression (GTEx) project
are analyzed using RNA-MuTect, a method developed for detecting somatic mutations
in RNA-seq data. Macroscopic clonal expansions, characterized by shared somatic
mutations, are detected in all tissues; skin, esophagus, and lung have the largest number
of somatic mutations.

How somatic mutations accumulate in normal cells is poorly understood. A comprehensive
analysis of RNA sequencing data from ~6700 samples across 29 normal tissues revealed
multiple somatic variants, demonstrating that macroscopic clones can be found in
many normal tissues. We found that sun-exposed skin, esophagus, and lung have a higher
mutation burden than other tested tissues, which suggests that environmental factors
can promote somatic mosaicism. Mutation burden was associated with both age and
tissue-specific cell proliferation rate, highlighting that mutations accumulate over both time
and number of cell divisions. Finally, normal tissues were found to harbor mutations in
known cancer genes and hotspots. This study provides a broad view of macroscopic
clonal expansion in human tissues, thus serving as a foundation for associating clonal
expansion with environmental factors, aging, and risk of disease.
A
s cells divide during life, they accumulate
somatic mutations. Although most of these
mutations are thought to be either neutral
or slightly deleterious (1), a few may in-
crease cellular fitness and contribute to
clonal expansion. This process is associated with
aging as well as with diseases such as coronary
heart disease (2, 3), neurological disorders (4),
and cancer (5). In cancer, the accumulation of
several mutations (known as “cancer drivers”)
eventually may transform the cells and promote
uncontrolled cellular growth. Despite work con-
tributing to our understanding of the molecular
and cellular aspects of cancer (6–14), we still only
partially understand the initiation and progression
of this disease. Acknowledging this gap, studies
have focused on studying somatic mutations in
normal human tissues and precancerous lesions,
aiming to identify early clonal expansions (3, 15–18).
Clonal expansions detected in normal blood are
enriched with mutations in several genes impli-
cated in hematologic cancers (3, 19). Ultradeep
sequencing studies by Martincorena et al. (17, 18)
in normal skin and esophagus tissues focused
on 74 cancer genes and detected a high burden
of low-allele frequency mutations associated with
skin and esophagus squamous cell carcinoma.
Despite these associations, it remains unclear
which specific clones will eventually develop into
cancer. Collectively, these findings emphasize
the need to comprehensively map and study the
prevalence and size of clonal expansion across
human tissues.
A pipeline for detecting somatic
mutations using RNA-seq data
For genomic data derived from normal tissues,
we leveraged the Genotype–Tissue Expression
(GTEx) project (20), a collection of data gener-
ated from more than 30 normal primary tissues
from hundreds of healthy individuals. These data
include RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of the
tissues as well as whole-genome and whole-exome
sequencing data of DNA extracted from matched
blood samples (release V7), providing an oppor-
tunity to explore all genes and tissues for the
existence of macroscopic clones that have ex-
panded to a detectable level in bulk RNA-seq.
To detect somatic mutations from bulk RNA-
seq data, we needed to first develop a pipeline,
called RNA-MuTect, to analyze this type of data.
To develop our approach for detecting somatic
mutations from RNA-seq data, we initially fo-
cused on a training set of 243 tumor samples
(representing six tumor types) from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) for which both DNA and
RNA were co-isolated from the same cells (table
S1). Applying our standard somatic mutation
calling pipeline (that was developed for DNA)
to both DNA and RNA from the tumor samples,
and using the matched-normal DNA as a germ-
line control (21), we found that the number of
mutations in RNA exceeded the number in the
corresponding DNA by a factor of 5 (Fig. 1A and
fig. S1A) (21). Moreover, 65% of the DNA-based
mutations were not detected in the RNA, and
92% of the RNA-based mutations were not found
in the DNA (21). One obvious reason for not de-
tecting DNA-based mutations in the RNA is the
insufficient sequence coverage in genes with low
expression levels; indeed, in a typical RNA sam-
ple, only 55% of the transcriptome had sufficient
coverage (≥95% sensitivity) to detect mutations
at the median DNA allele fraction (fig. S1B). When
accounting for the actual allele fractions of the
DNA mutations and coverage of RNA transcripts,
RNA-MuTect detected 82% of the sufficiently
covered mutations (fig. S2, A to D) (21).
Next, to address the excessive mutations de-
tected only in the RNA, we developed RNA-
MuTect, which is based on several key filtering
steps (fig. S3), including (i) removal of align-
ment errors by using two different RNA aligners;
(ii) removal of sequencing errors by a site-specific
error model built upon thousands of normal
RNA-seq data; and (iii) removal of RNA editing
sites using known databases (21). The vast ma-
jority (93%) of RNA mutations were filtered out
(fig. S2, E to G), reaching a median precision of
0.91 across samples (Fig. 1B), and only a median
of three detected mutations per sample remained
in the RNA-only set. RNA-MuTect retained a high
overall median sensitivity of 0.7 after filtering
(Fig. 1B and fig. S2E) (21), removing as few as 10%
of mutations that were detected in the DNA. Of
note, RNA-MuTect outperformed previous meth-
ods (22, 23) in terms of both sensitivity and pre-
cision for detecting mutations in RNA-seq (21).
To evaluate the robustness of RNA-MuTect on
an independent dataset, we collected a valida-
tion set of 303 TCGA samples representing six
tumor types (five differed from the training set;
table S1). RNA-MuTect achieved high sensitiv-
ity and precision on the validation set, in agree-
ment with the training set results (sensitivity of
0.72 and precision of 0.87; Fig. 1B).
The high overall performance of RNA-MuTect
enabled us to apply our standard tools for find-
ing drivers and mutational signatures to RNA-
based mutations (21, 24, 25), which yielded results
very similar to what was found in the DNA (Fig.
1, C and D, and figs. S4 and S5) (21). Our analysis
did, however, identify a yet-unreported muta-
tional signature in the RNA dominated by C>T
mutations; this signature represented only 7%
of the mutations, with the majority originating
from a single colon cancer sample (Fig. 1D). Of
these mutations, 75% were sufficiently covered
but not detected in the DNA, which suggests that
this signature may reflect a C>U RNA-editing
process.
Notably, to obtain a conservative (i.e., higher)
estimate of the false positive rate, we considered

mutations as false positives if they were detected
in the RNA but not in the DNA while having
sufficient coverage in the DNA. Although these
mutations could in theory be true RNA-only
mutations generated via RNA-specific processes
(but not in the RNA-editing databases), it is more
likely that they are in fact present in the DNA but
at allele fractions too low to be detected, as our
detection sensitivity calculations assume that the
underlying allele fractions of a mutation are the
same in the DNA and RNA. Although these two
allele fractions are often close, they can vary as
a result of variable gene- and allele-specific ex-
pression in different cell types within the sample.
One way to test this is by examining the corre-
lation between the number of RNA-only muta-
tions and the number of true positive mutations
detected in both RNA and DNA. We observed
a high correlation (Spearman R = 0.6, P = 4.2 ×
10−30). This indicates that many of the RNA-only
mutations are likely also in the DNA, because we
would not expect any correlation to exist be-
tween false positive (generated by either noise
or RNA processes) and true positive mutations.
Nonetheless, we continued with our conservative
approach throughout this study and considered
all RNA-only mutations detected in sufficiently
covered corresponding DNA loci to be false posi-
tive mutations. Overall, we conclude that high-
precision analysis of somatic mutations based on
RNA is achievable despite the apparent limita-
tions in calling mutations de novo from RNA-seq
data, allowing for most cancer-associated genes
as well as mutational processes to be revealed
from RNA-seq data.
Finally, to evaluate the performance of RNA-
MuTect on normal tissues, we applied it to a set
of 35 tumor-adjacent normal samples collected
in TCGA, wherein DNA and RNA were co-isolated
from the same sample (table S1). After ensuring
that the samples were not contaminated with
tumor cells (26), we detected 114 DNA-based mu-
tations, with a median allele fraction of 0.06.
These mutations and their low allele fractions
reflect the existence of small, yet macroscopic,
clones in these samples, as expected in normal
tissues. Of only eight mutations detected in the
DNA that had sufficient sequencing coverage
in the RNA to enable detection (21), three were
indeed detected, one had evidence in two reads
(just below our detection level), and the remain-
ing four had no supporting reads in the RNA
(table S2). Similarly, the 175 RNA-based muta-
tions had an average allele fraction of 0.07; of
the 86 that were sufficiently covered in the DNA,
13 mutations were detected. Overall, the number
of RNA-only mutations per sample was very low
(median of 1, average of 2; table S2). Because only
half of the RNA-based mutations had sufficient
coverage in the DNA, we conservatively estimated

the total number of false positive RNA-based
mutations per sample to be between 2 and 4.
Overall, when applying RNA-MuTect to nor-
mal samples with coextracted DNA and RNA data,
we found that DNA mutations with allele frac-
tions of >0.07 could be detected in the RNA in
cases where the gene was sufficiently highly ex-
pressed. As a specific example, a mutation with
an allele fraction of 0.05 requires coverage by
at least 124 reads in order to have >95% chance of
being detected, and ~17% of a typical transcrip-
tome from a TCGA RNA-seq sample is covered
to that depth (fig. S1B). More important, RNA-
MuTect detected a low number of potential false
positive calls per sample in normal tissues, con-
sistent with what we found in our cancer samples.
Detecting somatic clonal expansions
in normal tissues
After establishing RNA-MuTect’s performance
on both cancer and normal samples, we sought
to study somatic mutations across a comprehen-
sive collection of normal tissues by analyzing
RNA-seq data from the GTEx project (20). For a
mutation to be detected in bulk RNA extracted
from a normal tissue, a macroscopic clone that
harbors and expresses the somatic mutation
needs to contribute a sufficient amount of RNA
such that the signal can be observed over the
background RNA from other cells in the sample
(e.g., muscle and fat cells typically do not pro-
liferate, thus diluting the signal from the expand-
ing clone) (Fig. 2A). Thus, the ability to detect a
somatic mutation depends on (i) the clonal di-
versity of the sample, (ii) the depth of sequenc-
ing, and (iii) the expression level of the mutated
gene. In the GTEx dataset, RNA was extracted
from a relatively large amount of tissue material
[~20 mg of tissue, estimated to represent 30,000
to 730,000 cells depending on tissue type (21)],
limiting our ability to identify mutations present
inmicroscopicclonalpopulations.Wedid, however,

of the composition of bulk RNA extracted from a normal human tissue.
The biopsy consists of three different cell types that express different
transcripts (marked in blue, green, and yellow) at different levels. Blue cells
represent cells with a higher probability to form clones.Two clones, small and
large, are denoted by purple- and red-dashed outlines, respectively. Mutated
reads are marked with an X.The allele fractions of the mutations in the blue and
green genes are the same (0.25; 2/8 and 4/16 reads, respectively), despite
the different clone sizes. Additionally, the allele fraction of the mutation in the
yellow gene is higher than the allele fractions of the mutations in the blue
and green genes (0.33; 2/6 reads), even though the yellow mutation is
supported by the same (or smaller) number of reads.These scenarios illustrate
the challenge of identifying somatic mutations in bulk normal tissue due to
a mixture of cell types and the relatively small clones. Moreover, inferences
about clone size are limited because different cell types exist in different
proportions and express transcripts at different levels. (B) Numbers of

expect to detect macroscopic clones harboring mu-
tations found in ~10% of the cells.
Applying RNA-MuTect to 6707 RNA-seq sam-
ples against their matched-blood DNA, which
spanned 29 human tissues and 488 individuals
(21), we detected 8870 somatic mutations in 37%
(2519) of the samples, representing nearly all in-
dividuals (95%, 467/488; Fig. 2B and table S3).
Applying our conservative estimate based on the
TCGA data of two to four false positives per sam-
ple, 374 samples across 24 tissues had more than
four mutations (within these, 106 samples across
13 tissues had more than 13 mutations, which
is the conservative estimate at the 80th percent-
ile of false calls). Note that mutations detected in
samples with four or fewer mutations are not
necessarily false positives; for example, some of
these samples harbored known cancer driver
mutations that likely increased cell fitness. The
analyses described below provide evidence indi-
cating that many of the detected mutations are
somatic mutations that reflect clonal expansions
in normal tissue.
Similar to what we observed from analyzing
the tumor-adjacent normal samples from TCGA,
the median allele fraction of the mutations in the
GTEx normal tissue samples was 0.05 (Fig. 2C).
Although our ability to detect low-allele fraction
mutations in both DNA and RNA in GTEx sam-
ples was limited because they were extracted
from adjacent but different samples, we were
able to experimentally validate 5 of 28 mutations
by deep sequencing (table S4) (21). Consistent
with the majority of mutations being passengers,
like we observe in cancer, ~59% of the GTEx muta-
tions were missense mutations (fig. S6). However,
we also found that a few mutations in normal tis-
sue types matched mutations observed in their
corresponding cancer types (table S5). Overall,
these results support the idea that macroscopic
clonal expansion occurs across many normal
tissues throughout the body.
As expected, we found a negative correlation
between RNA-seq coverage and allele fraction
(Spearman R = –0.8, P < 10−200; Fig. 2C) due to a
higher probability of identifying low-allele frac-
tion mutations in highly covered sites. How-
ever, after correcting for detection sensitivity
[given the mutation allele fraction and the effec-
tive gene coverage (21)], we also observed a nega-
tive correlation between expression level and
expected number of mutations (fig. S7). Similar
findings in cancer are attributed to transcription-
coupled repair, which is more active in highly
expressed genes (27–29).
The tissues that typically harbor the greatest
number of mutations are skin, lung, and esoph-
agus. Associations between cancer incidence in
these tissues and environmental factors such as
ultraviolet (UV) radiation, air pollution, smok-
ing, and nutritional habits were previously shown
(30–36). Of note, sorting the normal tissues by
mutation frequency rather than by the average
number of mutations yielded essentially the same
order (fig. S8). Looking at tissue subregions, we
found that non–sun-exposed skin had more muta-
tions than nonexposed skin and contained the
highest number of mutations overall. Similarly,
esophagus mucosa, from which esophageal squa-
mous cell carcinomas derive (rather than from
either the gastroesophageal junction or esopha-
gus muscularis), had the second-highest muta-
tional burden (fig. S9). Interestingly, the only
tissue with a significant difference in the number
of mutations between males and females was
breast (P = 2.1 × 10−5, two-sided Wilcoxon test;
fig. S10), reflecting the observation that breast
tissue samples from males in the GTEx dataset
are mainly composed of fat cells, whereas female
breast tissue also includes epithelial cells.
Finally, we examined whether somatic mu-
tations could be detected in the blood (21). Fo-
cusing on a previously defined set of 332
single-nucleotide variants detected in the blood
of healthy individuals (3), we identified 87 muta-
tions in the DNA across 83 individuals (17% of
the studied individuals). For each of these 83
individuals, we next tested whether the exact
variant was present in other solid tissues from
the same individual. Only seven mutations were
found in at least one RNA sequencing read in
other tissues (each in a different individual) across
different tissue types (five in brain, one each in
thyroid and heart; table S6). This result most
likely suggests that blood had been captured in
the tissue samples. Previous results found an in-
crease in the number of detected mutations above
the age of 70 (3). Although the oldest person in
our dataset was 70 years old, we did observe a
trend (with borderline significance: P = 0.049,
one-sided Wilcoxon test) in which these 83 indi-
viduals were older than the rest of the cohort.
Clonal expansion increases with age and
tissue-specific cell proliferation rate
Several factors can affect the number of muta-
tions accumulated in normal tissues: (i) age, (ii)
accumulated DNA damage, and (iii) a tissue’s
propensity for forming macroscopic clones. All
are expected to be more prominent in tissues
with a higher cell proliferation rate (37, 38). To
test for these associations, we examined whether
the age of the individual correlated with the aver-
age number of accumulated mutations across
tissues. After the age of 45 (the cohort median
age), both the number of CpG>T mutations (aging
signature) and the total number of mutations
significantly increased (P = 0.001 and P = 2.2 ×
10−4, respectively, one-sided Wilcoxon test; Fig. 3A,
top row). This significant association remained
after (i) controlling for the number of tissues
sequenced in each individual (table S7) and (ii)
splitting all individuals into three age groups
(fig. S11, A, B, and E). As expected, when con-
sidering the top 10 tissues with the highest
level of cell proliferation (as determined by MKI67
expression, a marker of proliferation) (table S8),
this relationship became more significant for the
total number of mutations (P = 2.3 × 10−5, one-
sided Wilcoxon test) and remained similar for the
aging mutations (P = 0.004, one-sided Wilcoxon
test). In the 10 tissues with the lowest cell pro-
liferation, no significant association with age was
observed.
Next, we tested whether there was a tissue-
specific association with age. A significant associ-
ation was detected in skin and esophagus tissues
(P = 2.1 × 10−6 and P = 1.5 × 10−5, respectively, one-
sided Wilcoxon test; Fig. 3A, bottom row). When
considering sun-exposed and non–sun-exposed
skin separately, we found that although the num-
ber of observed mutations increased with age in
both skin types, the increase was significantly
greater in sun-exposed versus non–sun-exposed
skin [odds ratio = 3.29 and 1.26, P = 1.7 × 10−8 and
0.68, respectively (Fisher’s exact test), using the
number of mutations below or above the tissue’s
median mutation number (= 2); fig. S11C]. Be-
cause these samples derive from the same tissue
type, and hence are expected to have a similar cell
proliferation rate, this result suggests that either
(i) increased exposure to UV light and other en-
vironmental factors contributes to DNA damage
as an individual ages, or (ii) the size of clones
increases in both skin types with increasing
age, but the clones in sun-exposed skin enable
us to detect the mutations that were acquired
earlier in life. Differences were also observed
when testing esophagus-derived mucosa, gastro-
esophageal junction, and muscularis tissues
[odds ratio = 4.3, 0.87, and 4.7; Fisher’s P = 2.6 ×
10−7, 1, and 0.17, respectively (median = 2); fig.
S11D]. The lack of association in other tissues
could be due to either low cell proliferation rates
or the presence of clones below our detection
threshold.
We next directly examined whether cell pro-
liferation was associated with the number of
accumulated mutations across tissues. Indeed,
MKI67 expression was significantly higher in
tissues with a higher number of mutations (P =
8.2 × 10−4 and P = 1.2 × 10−4 for all primary and
subregion tissues, respectively, one-sided Wilcoxon
test; overall Spearman correlation of R = 0.44 and
P = 0.01; Fig. 3B and fig. S11F) (21). Overall, these
data suggest that both aging and exposure to
mutagenic factors contribute to the number of
accumulated mutations, especially in tissues with
high cell proliferation rates (37, 39).
Mutational signatures in normal tissues
In addition to the identified aging mutations
(CpG>T), we examined whether and which other
mutational processes were active in normal sam-
plesbyapplyingSignatureAnalyzer(21, 25). Because
most samples had a small number of mutations
(fig. S12) (21), we analyzed only the 169 samples
with ≥10 mutations. SignatureAnalyzer identi-
fied a UV signature in skin samples. This UV
signature is common in melanoma and has been
reported in skin fibroblasts and normal skin
samples (17, 36). When examining sun-exposed
and non–sun-exposed skin separately, the UV sig-
nature was active in 62/67 sun-exposed samples
and only 1/5 non–sun-exposed samples (Fig. 3C;
P = 5.7 × 10−4, Fisher’s exact test). Interestingly,
all the skin samples with ≥10 mutations analyzed
here were from the 447 individuals of European
ancestry. In contrast, none of the samples from
the 74 individuals of African ancestry had more
than six mutations (Fig. 3C), regardless of sun

exposure. Indeed, no difference in mutations was
found between sun-exposed andnon–sun-exposed
skin among African American individuals (an
average of 0.87 and 0.81 mutations, respectively;
P = 0.58, one-sided Wilcoxon test). Overall, skin
was the only tissue that showed a significant
difference between the total number of mutations
detected in European-ancestry versus African-
ancestry samples (P = 1.9 × 10−5, one-sided
Wilcoxon test; fig. S13).
Mutations in cancer genes in
normal tissues
To determine whether somatic mutations in
normal tissues occur in known cancer genes, we
tested the frequency of nonsynonymous muta-
tions within Cancer Gene Census (CGC) genes
(40). This CGC set represents genes in which
mutations have been causally implicated in can-
cer. We found that 3% of the samples and 33% of
the individuals carried at least one nonsynon-
ymous mutation in a CGC gene. Examining the
tissues enriched with nonsynonymous muta-
tions (21), we found that skin, esophagus, adi-
pose, adrenal gland, and uterus tissues were
significantly enriched with mutations in CGC
genes (empirical Q < 0.1) after controlling for
both gene length and coverage (fig. S14A).
Consistent with previous findings (17, 18), the
most frequently mutated cancer genes in our data
were TP53 and NOTCH1 (Fig. 4A). Examining

whether the number of mutations differed be-
tween samples carrying TP53 mutations and
those that did not, we found that the TP53-
associated samples had significantly more muta-
tions (P = 9.2 × 10−9, two-sided Wilcoxon test).
To test whether these TP53 mutations conferred
a growth advantage to the cell, we analyzed their
allele fraction level relative to all other detected
mutations in the same sample (21). Indeed, the
allele fractions of TP53 mutations were signifi-
cantly higher than other mutations in the corre-
sponding sample (empirical P < 0.02; fig. S14B).
Similarly, we also found that the NOTCH1-mutated
cases had a significant increase in the overall
number of mutations (P = 1 × 10−7, two-sided
Wilcoxon test) as well as a significantly higher
allele fraction of the NOTCH1 mutation (empir-
ical P < 9.9 × 10−4; fig. S14C). These findings
were independent of TP53 and NOTCH1 ex-
pression levels (fig. S14, B and C). This higher
allele fraction of the TP53 and NOTCH1 muta-
tions relative to other mutations in the same
samples suggests that these mutations appear
early in the history (i.e., the trunk) of these clones
and potentially affected by loss of heterozygosity.
However, because early appearance in the trunk
does not guarantee thatthese mutations conferred
a growth advantage, we cannot rule out the pos-
sibility that these early events are the result of
genetic drift; we do consider this possibility un-
likely, however, because both TP53 and NOTCH1
are known cancer genes. Overall, samples carry-
ing TP53 or NOTCH1 mutations were found only
in skin and esophagus tissues (with equal pro-
portions in each tissue; table S3), but no samples
harbored mutations in both of these genes.
We next examined whether any of the ~1760
recurrently mutated sites (hotspots) in known
cancer genes were observed in normal tissues
(table S9). We found 30 such mutations in eight
tissues that overall included 27 hotspots in 12 genes
(Fig. 4A and table S10). The gene with the greatest
number of detected hotspot mutations was
TP53 with 16 known hotspot mutations in both
skin and esophagus samples, 14 of which were
observed once in our dataset (Fig. 4A). In total,
10 of these mutations were previously reported
in either (i) normal human skin or peritoneal or
uterine lavage fluids taken from healthy women,
or (ii) human pluripotent stem cells (16, 17, 41, 42).
Reviewing the International Agency for Research
on Cancer (IARC) TP53 database (43), we found
that all of these mutations were annotated as
deleterious by the SIFT algorithm (44). Inter-
estingly, although all of the mutations were
annotated as loss-of-function in yeast, three
(R248Q, R248W, R282W) were reported to have
gain-of-function activities (45). R248Q knock-in
mice showed an earlier onset of tumor formation
and reduced lifespan, as well as an expansion of

hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cell pro-
genitors (46). The R248W variant was involved
in multiple gain-of-function activities, including
promotion of cell invasion (47) and increased cell
proliferation (48) among others (45). The R282W
variant increased colony formation (49). We
found that these 14 hotspot sites shared some
tissue specificity with the corresponding primary
cancerous tissue, wherein four skin mutations
and five esophagus mutations were also observed
in melanoma and esophagus TCGA samples, re-
spectively (Fig. 4B).
Among the other 14 non-TP53 hotspot muta-
tions, all but two were annotated as pathogenic
by FATHMM (50), and seven were also observed
in their corresponding cancer type (Fig. 4B).
Three PIK3CA mutations in the p.H1047L and
p.H1047R hotspots, which are common in mul-
tiple cancers (including esophageal cancer), were
observed in normal esophagus mucosa samples.
The well-known p.Q61R KRAS hotspot mutation
found in a normal testis sample of a 58-year-old
male was also reported in testicular germ cell can-
cer (51). The p.R183W hotspot mutation in the cell
growth regulator PPP2R1A detected in a normal
colon sample here was also detected in colorec-
tal cancer. Although the b isoform (PPP2R1B)
was discovered as a tumor suppressor in colon
cancer cell lines and primary tumors (52), the a
isoform had also been observed in a cohort of
primary colon tumors (53). The hotspot muta-
tion p.S45F in CTNNB1 (b-catenin) found in the
normal adrenal gland sample of a 58-year-old
female had previously been detected in adreno-
cortical adenomas; CTNNB1 is also significantly
mutated in adrenocortical tumors (10, 54, 55) and
when mutated deregulates the Wnt/b-catenin
pathway. The hotspot mutation p.R264C in the
PPP6C gene that we detected in normal skin was
also observed in melanoma, wherein this gene
was found to be significantly mutated (56).
To further explore whether clonal expansion
observed in normal tissues was in part due to
positive selection, we computed the dN/dS (ratio
of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions)
per gene (57), taking into account the trinucleo-
tide context and the mutational spectrum (21).
We found that both CGC genes and cancer genes
listed in Lawrence et al. (24) were enriched with
genes exhibiting a higher rate of nonsynony-
mous mutations (one-sided Wilcoxon P = 3.4 ×
10−4 and P = 9.3 × 10−4, respectively). These
data suggest that some of these mutations may
confer a selective advantage. Of note, these re-
sults become insignificant when removing genes
identified in skin and esophagus tissues. This
finding could be due to the overall low number
of mutations detected in the other tissues; alter-
natively, it may suggest that clones in skin and
esophagus tissues undergo positive selection,
whereas clones in the other tissues reflect gene-
tic drift.
To more specifically identify which of these
cancer genes are significantly mutated, we
performed a pan-normal analysis by applying
MutSig2CV (24) to all 2519 samples in which we
detected at least one mutation, restricting the
test to 718 known cancer genes (table S11). This
analysis yielded 16 significantly mutated genes,
with 99 nonsilent mutations spanning 17 tissues,
93 samples, and 82 individuals (Fig. 4C and fig.
S14D). In addition to TP53, NOTCH1, and FAT1
previously reported as significantly mutated in
normal skin (17), we also identified other genes
such as RAC1 and ZNF750, which are signifi-
cantly mutated in melanoma and esophagus
squamous cell carcinoma, respectively (9, 24).
Overall, our results show that cancer genes and
hotspots are present in normal tissues, especially
in skin and esophagus tissues.
Allelic imbalance in normal tissues
To study other somatic alterations in normal
samples, we developed a method for identify-
ing allelic imbalance across chromosome arms
using RNA-seq data (21), which is similar to
previous approaches used for detecting allelic
imbalance (58, 59). To test our approach, we
applied it to four TCGA samples for which DNA
and RNA were coextracted and showed that the
vast majority of allelic imbalance events at the
chromosomal arm level detected in the RNA
were also found in the DNA, and vice versa (fig.
S15). In addition, we found a high correlation
between the allele fraction of heterozygous sites
in the RNA and in the DNA (R range = 0.45 to
0.7, P < 8 × 10−225; fig. S16), which suggests that
approaches developed for detecting allelic im-
balance in DNA can also work for RNA.
Similar to a recent concurrent study of normal
esophagus DNA (18), we identified eight esoph-
agus mucosa samples that had an allelic imbal-
ance in 9q (Fig. 4D and fig. S17). Two of the
eight samples also had a nonsense or missense
mutation in NOTCH1 (hypergeometric P = 0.02),
a gene also located on 9q. The allele fraction of
these mutations was relatively high (0.22 and
0.12, respectively) and at the top quintile of their
corresponding samples. This might suggest that
either the wild-type copy of these chromosome
arms was lost, or that the mutated copy was
gained. Interestingly, 9q loss was more common
in esophageal dysplasia than in esophageal squa-
mous cell carcinoma (60). Its detection here in
nondysplastic lesions suggests that this may be
an early event in the development of dysplasia.
One additional sample with 9q imbalance was
found to carry mutations in both TP53 and FAT1.
An allelic imbalance in 22p and a mutation in
NOTCH1 were also identified in an additional
esophagus sample (fig. S17). Finally, we identified
a testis sample with a strong allelic imbalance in
17p, with no point mutation detected (fig. S17).
Discussion
This study presents a comprehensive overview
of somatic clonal expansion in human tissues.
Although the use of RNA to detect somatic mu-
tations is limited to expressed genes, we found
that RNA analysis can reveal true somatic varia-
tions after accounting for both sequencing and
alignment noise; moreover, RNA-based analysis
can identify both underlying mutational pro-
cesses and significantly mutated genes. Our
approach enabled us to detect thousands of
somatic mutations across all human tissues and
in almost all tested individuals, including muta-
tions at cancer hotspots and other cancer genes.
Macroscopic clonal expansion was detected in
all tissues. However, greater numbers of accu-
mulated mutations were observed in sun-exposed
skin, esophagus mucosa, and lung than in other
tissues. All three of these tissues are exposed to
carcinogenic environmental factors, emphasiz-
ing the contribution of extrinsic factors to the
mutagenesis process. Indeed, these tissues are
also among those carrying the greatest number
of somatic mutations in cancer patients (28),
consistent with the notion that a non-negligible
proportion of the mutations observed in cancer
accumulate well before disease (37). In both skin
and esophagus, we observed an association be-
tween the number of mutations in normal tissue
and age, suggesting a contribution of somatic
mosaicism to the aging phenotype (61). The lack
of association with age in normal lung tissue may
be masked as a result of the effects of other fac-
tors that are missing in our data, such as smok-
ing or exposure to air pollution.
Beyond these intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
the cellular microenvironment and tissue archi-
tecture are likely to influence the differences
observed among tissues. Studies of different
tumor types have shown differences in both the
composition of the microenvironment and the
transcriptional program active in each tissue
(62–69). In addition, it was previously argued
that tissue compartmentalization can affect
the rate at which cancer mutations accumulate
(70). For instance, the arrangement of the in-
testinal epithelium into crypts and villi is be-
lieved to limit the expansion of fitter cells (71).
Overall, the complex nature of transformation
from a normal to a cancer cell within different
tissues is a result of the interplay among genetic
and epigenetic events, tissue structure, exposure,
and the tissue microenvironment. More compre-
hensive and dedicated data and metadata from
various tissues should be collected to further
study these relationships.
Relative to studies focusing on microscopic
clones (17, 18), we found a significantly lower
number of clonal expansions, even though our
scale was much larger and not restricted to a
specific set of genes. Although this result can
be partially explained by our missing mutations
in genes with low expression levels, it also sug-
gests that the majority of clones remain micro-
scopic and do not expand to a size that can
currently be detected by bulk RNA-seq. In add-
ition, TP53 and NOTCH1 were the most mutated
genes in our data with a relatively high allele
fraction, but their overall frequency was lower
than previously observed in microscopic clones.
This suggests that mutations in these gene might
not be able to drive clonal growth beyond a cer-
tain size without additional genetic, epigenetic,
or environmental contributions. Furthermore, it
should be noted that we identified known driver
genes in some clones but not in many others.
This observation may suggest that these clones

do not have greater fitness and are the result of
genetic drift. In this study, we decided not to
draw any conclusions from the distribution of
allele fractions on selection beyond our findings
for TP53 and NOTCH1 because of the nontrivial
relation between variant allele fraction in RNA-
seq and clone size. Large-scale studies analyzing
DNA sequencing data are needed to better dis-
tinguish selection versus drift in macroscopic
clones in normal tissues.
The overall low rate of cancer-related events
in our data (<10%) most likely reflects both our
detection sensitivity and the fact that we have
analyzed only a single biopsy from each tissue
type in each individual. Given previous results
from deep sequencing on much smaller tissue
biopsies (17, 18), it is reasonable to assume that
we would have detected a larger number of so-
matic mutations across all normal tissues if we
analyzed more biopsies from any given tissue
type, and if those biopsies were more enriched
with epithelial cells. This implies that although
these macroscopic clones have expanded to the
point of detection, they would remain harmless
and may not develop into cancer until—and
only if—additional transforming events occur.
Also, the detection of hotspots and other muta-
tions in cancer genes across various normal
human tissues emphasizes the need for iden-
tifying drivers of the disease while considering
the nonpathogenic landscape of mutations. Such
findings may have an impact on the selection of
therapeutic and vaccination targets.
Understanding the earliest genetic events that
occur in human tissues may advance our under-
standing of aging and cancer. Therefore, initia-
tives such as the Pre-Cancer Genome Atlas (72)
will substantially aid our ability to detect and
treat the disease in its early stages. Because all
individuals in this study are deceased, we cannot
determine whether the detected clones would
have eventually developed into cancer upon ac-
quisition of additional genetic or epigenetic ab-
normalities. Studying clonal expansion of normal
samples longitudinally as they progress from
normal tissue to microscopic clones and finally
to macroscopic clones will shed light on which
of these premalignant lesions has the capacity
to transform into cancer; moreover, such a longi-
tudinal study can reveal the required combina-
tions of genetic and/or epigenetic events needed
for transformation.
Methods summary
We developed a method, called RNA-MuTect,
for identifying somatic mutations from a tissue
RNA sample and its matched-normal DNA. RNA-
MuTect includes several filtering steps designed
for RNA sequences. RNA-MuTect was validated
on both cancer and normal samples from TCGA,
wherein DNA and RNA were coextracted from
the same samples. A power analysis was performed
to evaluate the statistical power of observing a
mutation, given the mutation allele fraction and
sequence coverage at the site. MutSig2CV and
SignatureAnalyzer (24, 25) were applied for iden-
tifying significantly mutated genes and muta-
tional signatures, respectively. A context-dependent
dN/dS analysis was performed for identifying
genes with an excessive number of protein-altering
mutations. We applied HaplotypeCaller and fitted
a beta distribution in order to detect events of
allelic imbalance at the chromosome arm level.
