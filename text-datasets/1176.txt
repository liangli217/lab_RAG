abstract
Although replication repair deficiency, either by mismatch repair deficiency 
(MMRD) and/or loss of DNA polymerase proofreading, can cause hypermutation in 
cancer, microsatellite instability (MSI) is considered a hallmark of MMRD alone. By genome-wide analy-
sis of tumors with germline and somatic deficiencies in replication repair, we reveal a novel association 
between loss of polymerase proofreading and MSI, especially when both components are lost. Analysis 
of indels in microsatellites (MS-indels) identified five distinct signatures (MS-sigs). MMRD MS-sigs 
are dominated by multibase losses, whereas mutant-polymerase MS-sigs contain primarily single-base 
gains. MS deletions in MMRD tumors depend on the original size of the MS and converge to a preferred 
length, providing mechanistic insight. Finally, we demonstrate that MS-sigs can be a powerful clinical 
tool for managing individuals with germline MMRD and replication repair–deficient cancers, as they can 
detect the replication repair deficiency in normal cells and predict their response to immunotherapy.
Significance: Exome- and genome-wide MSI analysis reveals novel signatures that are uniquely 
attributed to mismatch repair and DNA polymerase. This provides new mechanistic insight into MS 
maintenance and can be applied clinically for diagnosis of replication repair deficiency and immuno-
therapy response prediction.

Introduction
The two major mechanisms that safeguard the fidelity of 
genome replication are the DNA mismatch repair machin-
ery and DNA polymerase proofreading (ε or δ, encoded by 
POLE and POLD1; refs. 1–4). Deficiencies of mismatch repair 
(MMRD) or polymerase proofreading can occur independently 
or simultaneously, leading to combined DNA replication repair 
deficiency (RRD). Both mechanisms maintain genome stabil-
ity by correcting misincorporated noncomplementary nucleo-
tides. Thus, when either or both pathways are inactivated, 
there is an increased rate of replicative mutagenesis that leads 
to a wide array of hypermutant cancers (1, 2, 4). The MMR 
machinery also repairs insertions and deletions in stretches of 
DNA with small repeated motifs [called microsatellites (MS)], 
which are created as a result of DNA polymerase slippage (4, 5). 
Nevertheless, the impact of DNA polymerase on the accumu-
lation of these MS insertions and deletions (MS-indels) in 
human cancer is currently not well described (6–9).
The increased number of MS-indels in MMRD tumors is 
marked by MS instability (MSI). MSI is clinically used for 
tumor stratification, referral to germline testing for cancer 
predisposition, and has recently been approved as a bio-
marker for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI; refs. 10–13). 
MSI is commonly detected by comparing MS lengths of a 
limited panel of MSs (five loci) between a patient’s tumor and 
germline DNA. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) used this 
approach to stratify tumors as MS unstable [MSI-high (MSI-H)] 
or MS stable (MSS) for colorectal, gastric, and endometrial 
tumors. However, this stratification approach has recently 
been challenged as being limited in scope, due to the misclas-
sification of some MMRD cancers (6, 14). Importantly, using 
this assay, polymerase mutant cancers do not exhibit high 
MSI (2, 15, 16), and therefore, in humans, the role of polymer-
ase mutations in the accumulation of MS-indels in cancer is 
currently considered largely unknown.
The most common cause of MMRD in human cancers is 
somatic hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter, whereas 
others are due to LOH from the germline allele in any one 
of the MMR genes, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2 (17, 18). 
Insight regarding the pathogenesis and clinical behavior of 
RRD can be gained by studying human syndromes with germ­
line mutations in these genes. Lynch syndrome is caused by 
germline heterozygous inactivating mutations in one of the 
MMR genes and is followed by somatic loss of the remaining 
allele, leading to MMR deficiency. Because it requires loss 
of only one allele, Lynch syndrome is associated with earlier 
cancer onset than somatic MMRD (19). However, although 
less common, the most aggressive form of MMRD stems 
from germline biallelic inactivating mutations in one of the 
MMR genes. This condition, termed constitutional MMRD 
(CMMRD), is one of the most aggressive cancer syndromes 
in humans, in which virtually all individuals will be affected 
by a variety of cancers during childhood, and all share hyper-
mutation and specific mutational signatures (1, 2, 4, 20). 
Similarly, heterogeneous germline polymerase mutations in 
the exonuclease (proofreading) domain of POLE or POLD1(1) 
result in a cancer syndrome termed polymerase proofreading 
deficiency (PPD), which is less well described but also leads to 
hypermutant cancers (1, 2, 7, 20–22). Importantly, MS-indels 
in either of these cancer predisposition syndromes have not 
been previously investigated.
In patients with CMMRD, somatic mutations in the poly-
merase genes result in combined dysfunction of the replica-
tion repair machinery, leading to a dramatic accumulation 
of single-nucleotide variations (SNV; refs. 1, 2, 7, 20–22). 
Analysis of SNV-based mutational signatures and their tim-
ing also enabled the prediction of early germline events and 
late treatment-related processes in each cancer that correlate 
with the type of RRD (2). Moreover, cancers with both MMRD 
and PPD have unique SNV signatures that are characteristic of 
the interaction between the two DNA repair mechanisms (7). 
Nevertheless, SNV-based analyses fail to provide information 
on several biological and clinical questions related to RRD car-
cinogenesis. These include insights regarding the mechanisms 
of mutagenesis during RRD tumor initiation and progression, 
explaining genotype–phenotype correlations between differ-
ent mutations in MMR and polymerase genes, and the ability 
to detect RRD in normal cells. These are highly important 
for the management of these patients and their tumors, and 
implementation of surveillance to family members.
Although indel-based signatures were recently reported 
(23), the accumulation of MS-indels and their potential signa-
tures in MMRD during tumorigenesis are not well described 
(24–26). Furthermore, the impact of polymerase mutations 
on the accumulation of MS-indels and their corresponding 
signatures in cancer is not known (6–9).
To answer the above biological and clinical questions, we 
used our large cohort of carefully annotated cancers and 
normal tissues from patients with germline mutations in the 
MMR and polymerase genes. We analyzed genomic MS-indels 
from this cohort using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and 
whole-genome sequencing (WGS), thoroughly investigating 
the roles of both replication repair machineries in correcting 
MS alterations, and their impact on cancer progression and 
response to therapy. Comparison of these tumors with adult 
RRD cancers and pediatric non-RRD tumors uncovered: (i) 
important insights into the accumulation of MS-indels in 
RRD cancers; (ii) a novel and distinct association between 
polymerase mutations and MS-indel accumulation; and (iii) 
a potential mechanism of MMRD that produces large dele-
tions in MSs by single events that converge to an MS-locus 
length of approximately 15 bp. We then considered using the 
activity levels of different MS-indel signatures for tumor strati-
fication and genetic diagnosis, and as biomarkers of response to 
immunotherapy.
Results
A Distinct Pattern of MSI in CMMRD Cancers
Because all cells from patients with CMMRD have impaired 
abilities to repair mismatches and MS-indels (1, 2), MSI 
should be prevalent in all normal and cancerous tissues. To 
test this hypothesis, we analyzed the MSI status of a cohort of 
96 CMMRD cancers and 8 normal tissues using the current 
gold-standard method, the Microsatellite Instability Analysis 
System (MIAS, Promega; refs. 27, 28). Strikingly, only 17 (18%) 
of the 96 CMMRD cancers and none of the normal tissues 
were classified as MSI-H (≥2 loci with ≥3 bp indels; Fig. 1A). 
This observation was not related to the specific ­MMR-mutated

gene (P = 0.95, Kruskal–Wallis, Supplementary Fig. S1A), and 
similarly, different tumors from the same patient resulted 
in different MSI classifications (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. 
S1B; Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, we observed tis-
sue specificity, with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers having the 
highest proportion of MSI-H (10/25, 40%) compared with 
brain tumors (2/51, 4%, P = 2 × 10−4, χ2 test).
It is unclear whether the lack of indels in the five MIAS 
MS-loci is a unique feature to these loci, or whether MS-
loci in CMMRD tumors universally have a low rate of indel 
accumulation. To test this, we applied MSMuTect to all of the 
MS-loci in the 69 tumor/normal whole-exome pairs of pedi-
atric CMMRD cancers (6). We found that pediatric CMMRD 
cancers had a significantly higher tumor MS-indel burden 
(TMSIB) than pediatric MMR-proficient (MMRP; n = 239) 
cancers (P < 2.0 × 10−15, Mann–Whitney U test, Fig. 1B). 
Importantly, pediatric CMMRD cases had a similar TMSIB 
to the adult MMRD cases (n = 114, P = 0.37), and no sig-
nificant difference was found in the TMSIB across pediatric 
cases from different tissues (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, the 
number of SNVs in the pediatric tumors was higher due to 
the somatic POLE mutations commonly found in CMMRD

tumors (2). Overall, our method demonstrates that, as pre-
dicted by the lack of MMR, pediatric CMMRD cancers indeed 
have an increased rate of MS-indel accumulation, similar to 
adult MMRD cancers.
MS-indels are spread equally on different chromosomes 
in both adult and pediatric cohorts (Fig. 1C; Supplementary 
Table S2), and increase between initial and relapsed tumors 
(ref. 29; n = 8; P = 0.014, Paired-samples Wilcoxon test; 
Fig. 1D). Furthermore, in contrast to adult MMRD tumors 
which exhibit highly mutated loci (refs. 6, 14; hotspots) 
like those used in the MIAS assay, pediatric MMRD tumors 
lacked this characteristic. For example, the MS in the ACVR2A 
gene (chr2:148683686-148683693) is mutated in approxi-
mately 45% of adult MMRD cases, but only 11% in pediat-
ric CMMRD cases (Supplementary Table S3). In addition, 
although adult tumors have 19 hotspots that are mutated in 
more than 30% of the cases, the strongest hotspot in pediatric 
tumors is mutated in approximately 20% (Fig. 1E; Supple-
mentary Table S4). Together, these observations suggest that 
MS-indels do accumulate in childhood CMMRD cancers and 
continue to accumulate as tumors progress. Furthermore, the 
key differences between adult and childhood MMRD cancers, 
i.e., the different mutated loci and the lack of MS-loci that are 
mutated very frequently, may explain why the MIAS assay was 
unable to detect MSI in pediatric tumors.
MMRD and Polymerase Mutant Tumors Have 
Distinct MSI-Indel Signatures
Another striking observation was that childhood tumors 
had a similar number of MS-indels as adult MMRD cancers, 
despite being largely MSS in the MIAS analysis (Fig. 1A). This 
was most clearly observed between childhood CMMRD brain 
tumors and adult GI cancers (P = 0.27, Mann–Whitney U test; 
Fig. 1B), as well as between pediatric and adult GI cancers 
(P = 0.37, Mann–Whitney U test; Fig. 1B). Because CMMRD 
tumors acquire somatic polymerase mutations, which are 
known to dramatically increase SNV mutations in cancer and 
MS-indels in yeast, we hypothesized that mutant polymerases 
actively contribute to MS-indel accumulation in pediatric 
CMMRD tumors (3, 30, 31). We therefore compared MS-
indels found in WES of 239 pediatric MMRP, 38 MMRD, 
4 polymerase mutant, and 31 combined RRD (MMRD and 
polymerase mutant) tumors with 505 adult endometrial can-
cers spanning the same four subtypes. Despite proficiency in 
MMR, polymerase mutant cancers exhibited increased MS-
indel burden in both pediatric and adult cancers (P = 0.0071, 
P = 1.1 × 10−8, respectively; Fig. 2A). Moreover, combined 
RRD cancers have an increased MS-indel burden compared 
with MMRD cancers in the pediatric cohort (P = 1.2 × 10−6; 
Fig. 2A, left), further highlighting the contribution of poly-
merase mutations to the accumulation of MS-indels.
Figure 1. (Continued) C, Proportion of mutated MS-loci in each chromosome in the entire cohort. The average proportion (90.7%) is labeled and 
shown as a gray-dotted line. The height of the bars indicates proportion, and similar heights indicate strong correlation of MS-indels to the number of 
MS-loci in that region of the chromosome. Supplementary Table S2 shows the similar proportions of MS-loci mutated in each chromosome. D, Compari-
son of the number of MS-indels in diagnosis and relapsed pediatric RRD tumors (n = 8). Statistical significance was calculated by the paired-samples 
Wilcoxon test. E, Analysis of recurrent indels in MS-loci, separated by adult MMRD cancers (red; n = 256) and pediatric MMRD tumors (blue; n = 69). Each 
point represents the fraction of tumors mutated for a given MS-locus (y axis) sorted from most to least frequently altered (left to right on the x axis).
Figure 2. MMRD and PPD tumors have distinct MS-indel signatures. A, Comparison of TMSIB between RRD variants (MMRD, PPD, and MMRD and 
PPD) with MMRP in pediatric brain and GI tumors (left) and adult endometrial tumors (right). Sample numbers are written below each group. P values cal-

length, separated by A- or C-repeats (z axis). The total number of MS-sig1 indels and MS-sig2 indels is compared between the RRD variants in boxplots 
(bottom left and bottom right). P values calculated using the Mann–Whitney U test. C, Graphical representation of RRD subgroups (2) separated by age 
of tumor onset, most common tumor types, proportion of RRD-associated COSMIC SBS signatures, and MS-sig1 and MS-sig2. The size of each graphic 
corresponds to the proportion of the cancer observed clinically. MS-sigs correlate to the proportion of the COSMIC SBS signatures in each cluster. 
Statistical significance was calculated using the Mann–Whitney U test.

We then wondered whether the two components of the 
replication repair machinery exert distinct alterations in 
MSs. To investigate this, we characterized each MS-indel 
based on three features, its motif (A or C), the MS length 
(5–20 bp), and the indel size (-3–+3 bp; Methods). We then used 
SignatureAnalyzer (32, 33) to infer the different mutational 
signatures based on these 192 (= 2 × 16 × 6) configurations 
and found 5 distinct MS-indel signatures (MS-sigs; Fig. 2B; 
Supplementary Fig. S2A). When compared with MMRP can-
cers (Fig. 2B), MMRD cancers were enriched for two signa-
tures dominated by 1 bp deletions in both A- and C-repeats 
(MS-sig1 and MS-sig3, Mann–Whitney U test, P < 2.2 × 10−16), 
whereas polymerase mutations resulted in two signatures 
dominated by 1 bp insertions (MS-sig2 and MS-sig4, P = 4.4 × 
10−14). In addition, we analyzed RRD cancers with driver 
mutations in POLD1 (encoding the DNA polymerase that syn-
thesizes the lagging strand; ref. 3; Supplementary Fig. 2B and 
S2C). POLD1mut cancers were similarly dominated by inser-
tions in MS-indels as POLEmut cancers (Supplementary Fig. 
S2B). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the unique 
mechanism of MS-indel accumulation by DNA polymerase 
is described in human cancers. Interestingly, our results are 
in agreement with several yeast studies, which showed a bias 
toward 1 bp insertions in MSs in mutant POLE strains as the 
leading strand polymerase (9, 34, 35), but contrast with other 
yeast reports which suggest that mutant POLD1 creates single-
base deletions in MS sequences (8, 36). Together, these findings 
support that POLE and POLD1 with defective proofreading are 
associated with increased insertion events (as opposed to the 
deletion events associated with MMRD) and can contribute to 
the overall TMSIB in human cancers.
Previously (2), we classified hypermutant cancers into three 
clinically relevant subtypes of RRD (MMRD, PPD, or both 
MMRD and PPD) based on their single-base substitution (SBS) 
signatures (COSMIC SBS signatures; Supplementary Fig. S3). 
We therefore examined the correlation of the MS-sigs to these 
clusters. MMRD and PPD (SBS-Cluster 1) are mostly seen 
in children with germline MMRD who later acquire somatic 
POLE mutations and fit a combination of MS-sig1 and MS-sig2. 
MS-sig1 is specific for MMRD-only cancers (SBS-Cluster 2) in 
both children and adults, and PPD (SBS-Cluster 3) cancers are 
highly driven by the mutant polymerase and have more MS-
sig2 MS-indels than MS-sig1 (P = 3.2 × 10−5, P = 0.0053, and 
P < 2.2 × 10−16, respectively; Fig. 2C). These data suggest 
that both SNV-based signatures and MS-sigs provide additional 
complementary information to standard mutational calls and 
can be used to clinically screen and stratify tumors in the future.
Accumulation of Large MS Deletions in MMRD 
Cancers with Preferred Final Length
To gain insight into the mechanism of MS-indel accumu-
lation during RRD tumorigenesis, we analyzed the patterns 
of MS-indels in whole genomes of 46 pediatric RRD cancers 
(39 brain, 4 colorectal, 1 osteochondroma, 1 Wilms tumor, 
and 1 T-cell lymphoma) and 28 MMRD adult cancers (12 
colorectal, 5 gastric, and 11 endometrial). The genome pro-
vides approximately 50 times more MS-loci compared with 
the exome, and has disproportionally higher numbers of 
longer (>20 bp) MS-loci. These two features enable a more 
refined analysis of the MS-indel distribution. Adult MMRD 
cancers present (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Figs. S3, S4A, S4B; 
Supplementary Table S5) bias toward deletions similar to 
their behavior in WES (Fig. 2B). They also present a new phe-
nomenon of accumulating long deletions (>3 bases), which 
increase in size with increasing MS-loci length. In contrast, 
pediatric CMMRD cases have mostly 1 bp deletions, and 
MMRD and PPD cancers are enriched with 1 bp insertions 
(Fig. 3A; Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4A–S4C; Supplemen-
tary Table S5) with a lack of long deletions. The lack of long 
MS-indels in pediatric cancers is likely the reason for the 
inability of the conventional electrophoresis methodologies 
(e.g., MIAS, Promega; Fig. 1A) to detect MSI in these cancers, 
as the standard assay cannot robustly identify short indels 
and considers only indels of ≥3 bases as robust events.
To better understand the kinetics of the accumulation of 
large deletions in MS-loci, we compared two known models. 
(i) A two-phase model where each mutational event can alter 
either a single repeat motif or multiple motifs; or a simple 
(ii) stepwise-mutation model, which assumes only one repeat 
motif is altered per mutational event, making large dele-
tions the amalgamation of multiple deletions (37, 38). The 
stepwise model predicts that the relationship between the 
MS-indel size and the frequency of the mutational events of 
that size will be unimodal (i.e., Poisson). On the other hand, 
the two-phase model enables a bimodal relationship between 
the MS-indel size and frequency (see Methods).
The pediatric tumors follow the predictions of the stepwise 
model (39) and present a sharp decrease in the frequency of 
MS-indels as the deletion size increases. In contrast, the adult 
tumors follow the stepwise model only for short loci (<12 bp), 
and from 12 bp and onward, they deviate from the stepwise 
model and resemble the two-phase model (ref. 37; Fig. 3B; 
Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4E).
Interestingly, the large deletions in adult tumors reduced 
the length of long (>15 bp) MS-loci to become approximately 
15 bp (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S4F). These findings 
suggest that there is an underlying mechanism of MS dele-
tions that gives larger loci the tendency to converge to 15 bp 
in length. A potential model for this phenomenon is that 
after the DNA polymerase replicates 12 to 15 bp on an MS-
locus, it may become more susceptible to slip off from the 
template strand. The width of the DNA-binding domain of 
the polymerase is known to be approximately 50 Å, which is 
approximately the combined length of 15 nucleotides (51 Å) 
in a DNA double helix (40). We predict that because 15 
nucleotides span the entire DNA-binding domain, the weak 
association of the polymerase to repeated nucleotides makes 
the polymerase especially prone to detach from the template 
strand. As the new strand then rebinds to the template 
strand, the template strand may generate a loop to become 
fully complementary to the approximately 15 bp of the nas-
cent strand (refs. 41, 42; Fig. 3D).
This process is restricted to deletions, hinting that it may 
be specific to MMR-deficient cells, whereas insertions in poly-
merase mutant cancers did not reveal the same large events 
(Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Clinical Applications of MS-Sigs
To begin answering the potential diagnostic and predic-
tive role of MS-indels in patients with RRD cancers, we first

germline MMRD and MMRD and PPD cancers in adults (TCGA) and children. Pediatric cancers have an enrichment of single-base MS-indels, whereas adult 
cancers accumulate insertions of one base and large (>3 bp) deletions that increase in size (x axis) with increasing locus length (y axis). Each color rep-
resents the log10 count of MS-indel events. B, The total number of MS deletions in both pediatric and adults by locus length (each plot presents a range 
of five bases) and mutation size (x axis). The number of deletions was averaged for each deletion length. C, The fraction of MS-indels by initial (x axis) 
and final/postmutation (y axis) lengths in adult tumors revealing the convergence of MS-loci to 15 bp (indicated by red arrow). Fraction of indels was 
calculated by dividing the number of indels corresponding to each initial and mutated locus length by total number of MS-indels in each initial MS-locus 
length. D, Schematic representation of the emergence of 15-bp-long MSs as a targeted locus length in adult MMRD cancers. The polymerase is prone to 
slippage after replicating a tract of 15 bp repeats, resulting in a loop in the template strand upon rebinding. If unrepaired, the loop can result in a deletion 
that causes the nascent strand to become 15 bp, irrespective of the original locus length.

compared the ability of MS-sigs to diagnose RRD cancers with 
currently used SNV-based clinically approved tools (2). The 
MS-indel signatures presented above (MS-sig1 and MS-sig2) are 
based on detecting MS-indels by comparing pairs of tumor and 
normal samples. However, the characteristic patterns of MS-
indels and the large number of MSs in the genome may enable 
analyzing tumors without the need for matched normal sam-
ples. To test this, we designed scores that reflect the prevalence 
of MS-sig1 (MMRDness score) and MS-sig2 (POLEness score, 
Methods) in any given sample. Both scores were calculated by 
taking the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of the number of 
-1 deletions (MMRDness) or +1 insertions (POLEness) divided 
by the total number of MS-loci within the specified lengths 
(10–15 bp for MMRDness and 5–6 bp for POLEness, Methods). 
Higher scores indicate higher prevalence of the MMRDness and 
POLEness signatures in each sample. Only MS-sig1 and MS-
sig2 were used due to the overwhelming dominance of A-repeat 
MS-loci in the genome compared with C-repeats, which are rep-
resented by MS-sig3 and MS-sig4. We calculated the two scores 
for a well-characterized set of tumors and were able to separate 
the four subtypes that we analyzed (MMRP, MMRD, PPD, and 
MMRD and PPD; Fig. 4A).
We then validated whether the MMRDness and POLEness 
scores can be used as a more cost-effective clinical tool for 
detecting MMRD and PPD. We sequenced 52 MMRP and 
RRD tumors with a small fraction of the standard genomic 
coverage (0.5X instead of the typical 30X) and calculated their 
MMRDness and POLEness. We observed similar clustering of 
the RRD subtypes (Supplementary Fig. S5A), validating their 
ability to accurately and cost-effectively classify RRD tumors. 
Subsequently, we tested whether the MS-sigs can improve 
the current SNV-based methods used to screen and diagnose 
RRD tumors (4). We assessed the MMRDness and POLEness 
scores (Methods) of 72 tumors for which WGS was available 
through our clinical SickKids Cancer Sequencing (KiCS) 
program (2). The MMRDness score uncovered four tumors 
(Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S5B) that were not known to 
be MMRD by the sequencing center, as they had relatively 
low tumor mutational burdens and no SNV-based MMRD 
signatures (3–17 Mut/Mb; Supplementary Table S6). Genetic 
testing revealed that three of them had canonical Lynch syn-
drome germline mutations, and the remaining one carried a 
novel germline MMR mutation (Supplementary Table S6). 
This suggests that MMRDness and POLEness can be both a 
more accurate and less expensive test compared with current 
methods for detecting RRD in tumors.
Analysis of Whole-Genome MSI Signatures Can 
Diagnose CMMRD in Normal Cells
Having established the ability of MS-sigs and the corre-
sponding MMRDness score to identify MMRD tumors, we 
tested the ability of the tool to identify germline (CMMRD) 
mutations in nonmalignant (blood) samples. All nonmalig-
nant samples from patients with CMMRD (n = 34) had an ele-
vated MMRDness score compared with patients with MMRP, 
polymerase mutant, and Lynch syndrome (P = 8.7 × 10−11, 
Mann–Whitney U test; Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S5C). 
Notably, the Promega panel assay was completely unable to 
detect CMMRD in nonmalignant tissues (Fig. 1A), and, simi-
larly, SNV-based signatures are not able to detect hypermuta-
tion in normal cells. The MMRDness score requires neither a 
patient-matched normal control nor high sequencing depth 
to detect the MS-sig patterns throughout the genome that 
correspond to CMMRD. The high specificity and sensitivity of 
the MMRDness score (Fig. 4D) enables it to be an inexpensive 
and robust assay for screening and diagnosing CMMRD prior 
to cancer, which can be used to implement early surveillance 
protocols to improve the survival of patients with CMMRD. 
On the other hand, the diagnostic role of POLEness is limited 
to RRD tumors (Fig. 4A), and further investigation is required 
to assess its ability to detect PPD in the germline.
Different Alterations of the MMR and  
Polymerase Genes Have Varying Effects on 
MMRDness and POLEness
The four genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, that when 
mutated lead to MMRD, play different roles in the MMR mech-
anism (43). However, thus far, no footprint has been found in 
the mutational landscape for the four different genes. For exam-
ple, germline mutations in MSH2 and MLH1 have higher pen-
etrance than MSH6 and PMS2, and are found most commonly 
in adult Lynch syndrome cases. In contrast, for individuals with 
CMMRD, the reverse is observed. PMS2 is the most commonly 
mutated gene, followed by MSH6, and biallelic MSH2 germline 
mutations are extremely rare. These cancers have similar tumor 
mutation burdens (TMB) irrespective of the mutated MMR 
gene (1, 2); thus, the different penetrance cannot be simply 
explained by a higher mutation rate. Other functional assays 
have also failed to explain this genotype–phenotype relation-
ship despite the different mechanistic roles of the MMR genes. 
Similarly, PPD is almost strictly observed with POLE but not 
POLD1 germline mutations—an observation that also cannot 
be explained by differences in TMB or other functional assays.
We therefore evaluated whether the deficiency in different 
genes may have distinct effects on the MMRDness score (Fig. 4E). 
We found that MMRD cancers with biallelic inactivating muta-
tions in MSH2 had the strongest MMRDness score, followed by 
MLH1, and was much lower in PMS2 mutant cancers (P = 6.7 × 
10−4, Mann–Whitney U test; Fig. 4E). This fits well with the clini-
cal observations of MMRD, as MSH2 and MLH1 mutations have 
higher cancer penetrance than PMS2 and MSH6. This also corre-
lates with the known mechanism of MMR, as the MSH2 protein 
initially recognizes mismatches during replication and is crucial 
for both the mutSα and mutSβ complexes, whereas MLH1 is an 
important factor in the mutL complex (44–46).
Next, we investigated whether the two polymerase genes 
(POLE and POLD1) have a distinct effect on the POLEness 
score. POLD1mut cancers had significantly higher POLEness 
scores than POLEmut cancers (P = 2.7 × 10−4, Mann–Whitney 
U test; Fig. 4E), supporting our previous finding from the 
exomes (P = 2.3 × 10−4, Supplementary Fig. S2C), where 
­POLD1mut cancers had a higher TMSIB than POLEmut. This 
can be explained by the replication of the lagging strand 
inherently having more dissociation and slippage of the poly-
merase from the DNA (16, 47).
POLEness Score Predicts Response to 
Immunotherapy in RRD Cancers
It was recently shown that RRD tumors tend to respond 
to ICI therapy (48). However, not all patients respond, and

­currently there is no adequate method to distinguish respond-
ers from nonresponders (Supplementary Fig. S6A). As MS-
indels are highly immunogenic (10, 49–52), we hypothesized 
that within the context of RRD cancers, MMRDness and/or 
the POLEness score could predict response to ICI therapy. 
To test this, we initially used WGS data of 22 RRD tumors 
undergoing ICI as a part of our consortium registry study 
(48). We observed that the POLEness score of responders was 
higher than nonresponders to ICI (P = 0.011, Mann–Whitney 
U test; Fig. 5A), and tumors with a high POLEness score (≥2.92 
POLEness, Methods) had a significantly higher survival than 
the low POLEness group (P = 0.012, Log-rank test; Fig. 5A). We 
therefore tested the ability of the POLEness score to predict 
response to ICI using exomes from a larger cohort of patients 
(n = 28). POLEness scores were higher in responders to ICI 
therapy than in nonresponders (P = 0.0016, Mann–Whitney 
U test; Fig. 5B). However, exome and genome MMRDness was 
not shown to have a significant ­difference between respond-
ers and nonresponders, potentially because all tumors in the 
cohort are MMRD (Supplementary Fig. S6B). The high-POLE-
ness groups in both genome and exome had significantly 
longer survival times than the low-POLEness groups (P = 0.012 
and 0.016, Log-rank test; Fig. 5A and B). To our knowledge, 
this is the first time that a mutational signature was suggested 
as a biomarker to distinguish between responders and nonre-
sponders to ICI in RRD tumors (10, 49–51). This result sheds 
new light on the immunogenicity of MS-indels and the use of 
their signatures as novel biomarkers for response to immune 
checkpoint inhibition in the context of RRD.
Discussion
This report uncovers roles for both components of the 
replication repair machinery in MS-indel accumulation in 
cancers. These observations address important fundamental 
biological questions regarding accumulation of MS-indels 
during carcinogenesis, which can be translated to clinical use.
Our data reveal that in addition to defects in MMR, loss of 
proofreading by replication-specific DNA polymerases is also 
associated with an increase in MS-indels. MS-indels produced 
by the deficiencies of the two replicative repair mechanisms have 
distinct characteristics. Although MMRD generates mainly 
deletions (MS-sig1 and MS-sig3), PPD results predominantly 
in insertions (MS-sig2 and MS-sig4), suggesting a strand-bias 
repair process (Supplementary Fig. S7). The MS-sigs described 
were comparable to the ID-1 and ID-2 indel signatures reported 
in the study by Alexandrov and colleagues, which were common 
in tissues that are associated with RRD (23). However, Alexan-
drov and colleagues did not analyze MS-indels in loci longer 
than five repeated units, and therefore were not able to find the 
unique MS-sigs present in larger MS-loci.
We hypothesize that the proofreading domain of the poly-
merase repairs extra bases on the nascent strand by changing 
the conformation of the DNA to push the substrate into 
the exonuclease domain of the polymerase. This would acti-
vate the exonucleolytic mode of DNA polymerase to excise 
the loop. Because mutations in the proofreading domain 
of the polymerase would prevent the DNA substrate from 
shifting into the exonuclease site, these remain unrepaired

DNA Polymerase Has Novel Microsatellite Mutation Signatures

as ­replication continues (34, 53), creating a permanent inser-
tion. As larger insertions were not observed in PPD cancers, 
we postulate that larger indel loops within the nascent strand 
do not fit into the exonuclease domain of the polymerase 
(Supplementary Fig. S7). In contrast, the MMR system is 
more effective in detecting loops on the parental strand (3, 
45, 54, 55). These loops would result in deletions if unre-
paired, which translated into the surge of MS-sig1 and MS-
sig3 in MMRD cancers in our cohort.
Another intriguing observation related to the role of MMR 
on the template strand is that larger deletions in adult MMRD 
cancers converged to a common length of MSs of approxi-
mately 15 bp (Fig. 3C). We propose that this 15 bp conver-
gence is due to the size of the DNA-binding domain of the 
polymerase complex being similar to the length of 15 bp, 
which is about 50 Å (40). Indeed, these large events can explain 
the ease of detection of MSI-H in adult MMRD cancers by the 
standard electrophoresis-based assay that specifically looks for 
long (≥3 bp) MS-indels. Furthermore, pediatric tumors lacked 
hotspots or commonly mutated MS-loci even within specific 
tissues (Fig. 1E; Supplementary Table S3). In adults, MMRD 
cells can acquire MS-indels in the ACVR2A gene, which may 
lead to a selection advantage in the GI system, but not in other 
tissue types. Thus, the contrast between pediatric and adult 
cases may be due to the selective pressures that are present in 
different tissue types, although comparative analysis between 
pediatric and adult GI cancers still showed unique MS-indel 
profiles (Supplementary Fig. S4B). In addition, the distinct 
MS deletions in adult and pediatric cancers might be due to 
unknown differences in DNA damage sensing or response 
mechanisms. Further experimental investigation could clarify 
these phenomena and can hint toward a better understanding 
of the kinetics and patterns of MS-indel accumulation.
The biological observations described above can have a 
major clinical impact on the management of patients with 
RRD cancers. First, the standard methods for MSI classifica-
tion (e.g., MIAS Promega) cannot detect MSI in most pediat-
ric MMRD tumors (Fig. 1A) and possibly in tumors in which 
MMRD occurs late in carcinogenesis due to other mutational 
processes. The latter includes treatment-related MMRD can-
cers such as leukemias, gliomas, and POLEmut-driven tumors 
(2, 56, 57), where MMRD occurs later, and which are there-
fore falsely termed MSS (6, 15, 16). Both SNV- and MS-
indel–based methods may be more sensitive and specific to 
classify such tumors correctly for management and potential 
genetic testing. In addition, MS-sigs were able to differentiate 
between MMRD and PPD tumor genotypes (Fig. 4E), which 
has not been previously shown through SNV or the canonical 
MSI analysis method. The increased MMRDness signature in 
MSH2 and MLH1 mutant tumors (Fig. 4E) correlates with the 
more aggressive phenotype seen in Lynch syndrome cases and 
the biological importance of the two proteins in the repair 
mechanism of the mutSα and mutSβ MMR complexes (44–
46). The ability to use low-pass WGS from tumors, without 
their matched normal samples, can make MS-sigs the basis 
for an inexpensive tool for RRD classification. There has been 
a recent report that used deep sequencing of a panel of 277 
MS-loci to diagnose CMMRD using blood DNA (58). How-
ever, our method of ultra low-pass WGS (ULP-WGS) at 0.1 to 
0.5X coverage is less expensive per sample and covers between 
10% and 50% of the approximately 23 million MS-loci, respec-
tively. The ULP-WGS approach can be more sensitive and spe-
cific than deep sequencing of specific loci, depending on the 
depth of sequencing in each of the approaches. MS-sigs can 
also provide additive information to the clinical diagnosis, 
such as the POLEness signature that can predict response to 
immunotherapy (Fig. 5). Ongoing and future investigations 
will compare the effectiveness of the two methods in detect-
ing CMMRD.
Second, we showed that MS-sigs can be used to detect 
MMRD in nonmalignant samples of individuals with 
CMMRD. The potential to detect MMRD from nonmalig-
nant samples, perhaps even before cancer development, has 
important clinical applications. In many cases, genetic diag-
nosis of CMMRD is difficult due to the large number of vari-
ants of unknown significance (VUS) and pseudogenes in the 
mismatch repair and DNA polymerase genes. Furthermore, 
MS-sigs were found to have extremely high sensitivity and 
specificity (both 100% in our cohort) in detecting MMRD 
in tumors and CMMRD in normal tissue. MS-sigs can dis-
tinguish functionally disruptive mutations from VUSs and 
pseudogenes in the MMR and polymerase genes, and can be 
conducted using low quantities (<150 ng) of unmatched DNA 
from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) or frozen tis-
sue (Fig. 4D). We suggest here that MS-sig is an assay that can 
assess the MMRD phenotype from accessible, nonmalignant 
tissues, which may become a frontline tool for the clinical 
diagnosis of RRD tumors and for monitoring patients at high 
risk. Further validation on clinical cohorts is required.
Finally, our data provide further support for the notion 
that MS-indels may be strongly immunogenic in RRD hyper-
mutant cancers (59). In our cohort, MS-sig–based POLEness 
score, but not MMRDness, was a predictive biomarker for 
response to immune checkpoint inhibition. This adds to 
the recent report which correlates MSI status to anti–PD-1 
immunotherapy response (49). Because our cohort includes 
responders from brain and other tumor sites, which are not 
considered MSI-H using conventional methods, the robust-
ness of next-generation sequencing–based MS-sig analysis 
may be superior to panel-based methods. Our observations 
suggest that the single repeat insertions represented by the 
POLEness signature likely yield highly immunogenic neo-
antigens, which in turn result in a robust immunogenic 
response against RRD tumor cells (48, 60, 61). Future large 
studies comparing MSI-based signatures with other genomic 
features of RRD cancers, as well as investigating differences in 
immunotherapy response between MMRD, PPD, and MMRD 
and PPD cancers will be required to validate our findings.
In summary, our data add a new dimension to the role 
of RRD in human cancer mutagenesis in the form of MS 
maintenance and instability. Studies of cancers emerging 
from rare, germline childhood cancer syndromes provide 
important insights and may be applied to more common 
adult cancers. Further mechanistic analysis will potentially 
explain the different types and sizes of MS-indels that are 
introduced during tumorigenesis. Future studies will deter-
mine the impact of both MMRD and PPD on MSs, which 
can lead to advancements in the classification, diagnosis, and 
determination of biomarkers in the management of RRD 
cancers and individuals.

Methods
Sample Collection and DNA Extraction  
for WES and WGS of RRD Tumors
As described in previous reports, patients with RRD have been 
routinely consented and registered into the International Replica-
tion Repair Consortium with written informed consent. The study 
was conducted in accordance with the Canadian Tri-Council Policy 
Statement II and was approved by the Institutional Research Eth-
ics Board (approval number 1000048813), and all data were cen-
tralized in the Division of Haematology/Oncology at The Hospital 
for Sick Children (SickKids; Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Tumor 
and blood samples were collected from the SickKids tumor bank, 
and diagnosis of RRD was confirmed via sequencing and immu-
nohistochemistry of the four MMR genes and sequencing of the 
POLE and POLD1 genes by a clinically approved laboratory. DNA 
was extracted using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit for 
frozen tissues, and the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit for paraffin-
embedded tissues.
WES and WGS Data of Pediatric Tumors  
in the KiCS Program
WES and WGS data of pediatric tumors were obtained through 
the KiCS program. Detailed information about KiCS can be found at 
www.kicsprogram.com.
WES Data of Pediatric Brain Tumors
Written informed consent was provided for patients with brain 
tumors treated at The Hospital for Sick Children and was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board. DNA from the tumors and non-
malignant samples was extracted for WES. Further details on the 
DNA extraction protocol and exome-sequencing pipeline are avail-
able in previous reports.
WES and WGS Data and MSI Status Identification  
of Adult Tumors in TCGA Database
WES and WGS data for colorectal carcinoma, stomach adenoma, 
and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma were downloaded from 
TCGA and were sequenced on the Illumina platform. As described in 
a previous report, their MSI status was annotated by TCGA.
WES Data of Pediatric Neuroblastoma  
from the TARGET Database
WES data of pediatric neuroblastoma were acquired from the 
Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments 
(TARGET) initiative.
MSI Status of Pediatric Tumors Determined  
by the MIAS (Promega)
DNA extracted from tumor and matched normal tissues was 
quantified with Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and amplified 
with Platinum Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
and MSI 10X Primer Pair Mix (Promega) in a Veriti 96-Well Thermal 
Cycler, as per the manufacturer’s recommendations for PCR cycling 
conditions. The primer mix targets a panel of five mononucleotide 
loci, termed BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24, and MONO-27, and fol-
lowing amplification, the products were run in a 3130 Genetic Ana-
lyzer for fluorescent capillary electrophoresis. Electrophoretograms 
were subsequently visualized using the Peak Scanner Software (v1.0, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the highest peaks that were flanked by 
lower peaks were selected to be the representative alleles for each of 
the five loci in the panel. Each tumor–normal pair was compared by 
their allelic lengths. Tumors were considered MSI-H if two or more 
loci were unstable (≥3 bp shift from the normal allele), MSI-L if one 
locus was unstable, and MSS if all five loci were stable (<2 bp shift 
from the normal allele; refs. 27, 28).
Exome Sequencing of RRD Pediatric Tumors
All high-throughput sequencing and mutation identification were 
performed at The Centre for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for 
Sick Children, as described in previous reports (1, 2). Briefly, tumor 
and matched nonmalignant tissue DNA was sequenced on an Illumina 
HiSeq2500 machine using Agilent’s exome enrichment kit (Sure Select 
V4/V5; with >50% baits above 25x coverage). Processing into FASTQ 
files was done using CASAVA and/or HAS, which were aligned to 
UCSC’s hg19 GRCh37 with BWA. The realignment and recalibration 
of aligned reads were done using Short-read micro re-aligner and/or 
Genome Analysis Toolkit and the Genome Analysis Toolkit26 (v1.1–28), 
respectively. Whole-exome TMB was calculated using MuTect (v1.1.4) 
and filtered using dbSNP (v132), the 1000 Genomes Project (February 
2012), a 69-­sample Complete Genomics dataset, the Exome Sequencing 
Project (v6500), and the ExAc database for common SNPs.
Genome Sequencing of Pediatric Tumors
WGS was done using the Illumina HiSeq2500 or Illumina HiSeqX 
at ≥30X coverage, as well as on the Illumina NovaSeq6000 at 0.5X 
coverage. Read realignment and recalibration were conducted using 
the same pipeline as exome sequencing.
Exomic and Genomic MS Definition and Identification and 
Mutation Calling via MSMuTect
The detailed methods of the MSMuTect algorithm were previously 
reported (6). Briefly, repeats of five or more nucleotides were consid-
ered to be MS loci, and using the PHOBOS algorithm and the lob-
STR approach, tumor and normal BAM files were aligned with their 
5′ and 3′ flanking sequences. Each MS-locus allele was estimated 
using the empirical noise model, P
k m
j m
Noise
(
)(
),
,
,
 which is the probabil-
ity of observing a read with an MS length k and motif m, where the 
true length of the allele is j with the motif m. This was used to call the 
MS alleles with the highest likelihood of being the true allele at each 
MS-locus. The MS alleles of each tumor and matched normal pair 
were called individually, which were compared to identify the muta-
tions on the tumor MS-loci. The Akaike Information Criterion score 
was assigned to both the tumor and normal models, and a threshold 
score that was determined by using simulated data was applied to 
make the final call of the MS-indel.
MS-Indel Signatures Discovered by SignatureAnalyzer
For the WES samples noted in Supplementary Table S7, we quanti-
fied the number of MS-indels they had using different parameters, 
defined by the length of the MS-locus in the normal sample, the size of 
the indel (one base indel, two base indel, etc.), and the MS-locus motif 
(A- and C-repeats, Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S2A). We then used 
the Bayesian Non-negative matrix factorization algorithm (Signature-
Analyzer; refs. 32, 33) with its default parameters to infer the different 
mutational processes operating in our samples. We did not include 
other repeat motifs, as they do not have sufficient mutational events.
Calculation of MMRDness and POLEness Scores
Exome- and genome-wide MS-indels in each sample were quanti-
fied and segregated into deletions and insertions of up to three bases, 
and by locus size from 5 to 40 bases. The number of MS-indels in 
each sample was normalized to its own sum of total MS-indels. 
MMRDness scores were calculated by taking log10 of the sum of the 
average proportions of one base deletions in loci sized from 10 to 15 
bases. The POLEness scores were similarly calculated by taking log10 
of the sum of the average proportions of one base insertions in loci 
sized five to six bases. Both scores were normalized to the total num-
ber of MS-loci with the respective lengths.

WES MS-Indel Quantification and Comparison
Exome-wide MS-indels for each tumor/normal pair were identified 
and quantified using MSMuTect (6). We processed the MSMuTect 
output using the Rstudio graphical user interface (v1.1.447). The pro-
cessing included summing the total number of MS-indels and calcu-
lating the length change of each MS in each tumor compared with 
their matched normal samples. The median numbers of MS-indels in 
the exome of each tumor type and in each MS-indel signature cluster 
were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test in Rstudio, and sta-
tistical significance was considered at P < 0.05.
WGS MS-Indel Quantification
Genome-wide MS-indels were summed for each sample according 
to the reference length of each locus and the change in size/length 
of the indel. Genome-wide deletions were identified and summed for 
both adult and pediatric samples, and were averaged for each deletion 
length. The mean and SDs were calculated using Rstudio (v1.1.447) 
at each deletion length in adult and pediatric samples independently. 
Fractions of indels based on initial and mutated loci size in adult can-
cers were calculated by dividing the number of events pertaining to a 
specific initial and mutated locus size by the sum of all MS-indels in all 
adult tumors. The same procedure was followed for pediatric cancers.
MMRDness and POLEness Score Comparison between 
Deficient MMR and Polymerase Proofreading
MMRDness medians were calculated for pediatric RRD tumors 
with the same mutated MMR gene, and compared between the four 
genes using the Mann–Whitney U test. Similarly, POLEness medians 
were calculated for POLE or POLD1 mutants and compared.
MMRDness and POLEness Score Calculation and 
Comparison for Ultra Low-Coverage WGS Samples
MMRDness and POLEness scores were calculated as explained 
above for the ultra low-pass coverage sequencing samples. The 
tumors were separated according to their RRD type (MMRP, PPD, 
MMRD, and MMRD and PPD), and medians of their MMRDness 
were calculated. Comparison of MMRDness between groups was 
done using the Mann–Whitney U test. Germline samples were also 
segregated based on their RRD statuses (MMRP, PPD, Lynch, and 
CMMRD), and their MMRDness scores were compared using the 
same method as the tumors.
Immunotherapy Response Thresholds for POLEness Scores
POLEness scores were determined from 28 tumors where WES 
was available, and from 22 of them that had WGS available. These 
tumors were collected from patients with RRD cancers who under-
went immunotherapy. POLEness scores were calculated as described 
above. For survival analysis, tumors were separated by their respec-
tive median POLEness scores (-2.92 in genome and -2.75 in exome). 
P values were determined using the log-rank test.
