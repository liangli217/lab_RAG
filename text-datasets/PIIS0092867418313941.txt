SUMMARY
Treatment of cancer has been revolutionized by
immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Despite
the high rate of response in advanced melanoma,
the
majority
of
patients
succumb
to
disease.
To identify factors associated with success or fail-
ure of checkpoint therapy, we proﬁled transcrip-
tomes of 16,291 individual immune cells from 48
tumor samples of melanoma patients treated with
checkpoint inhibitors. Two distinct states of CD8+
T cells were deﬁned by clustering and associated
with patient tumor regression or progression. A
single transcription factor, TCF7, was visualized
within CD8+ T cells in ﬁxed tumor samples and pre-
dicted positive clinical outcome in an independent
cohort of checkpoint-treated patients. We delin-
eated the epigenetic landscape and clonality of
these T cell states and demonstrated enhanced
antitumor immunity by targeting novel combina-
tions of factors in exhausted cells. Our study of
immune cell transcriptomes from tumors demon-
strates a strategy for identifying predictors, mech-
anisms, and targets for enhancing checkpoint
immunotherapy.
INTRODUCTION
Antibodies that block immune checkpoint proteins, including
CTLA4, PD-1, and PD-L1 (Callahan et al., 2016), are FDA
approved for treating a wide variety of cancers, including mela-
noma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma. In melanoma, despite
the high response rate (Larkin et al., 2015; Robert et al., 2015),
most patients are refractory to therapy or acquire resistance.
Identiﬁcation of components that drive or prevent effective re-
sponses to checkpoint therapy thus remains an urgent need
for understanding and expanding the use of immunotherapy in
patients.
Checkpoint therapies were developed to overcome the
dysfunction or exhaustion of T cells (Speiser et al., 2016; Wherry
et al., 2007) resulting from chronic antigen exposure and sup-
pression by the tumor or cells in its microenvironment. However,
it remains unclear why some patients respond to checkpoint
therapy while others do not. One factor associated with outcome
is the number of inﬁltrating CD8+ T cells detected before (Tumeh
et al., 2014) or during early treatment (Chen et al., 2016). In addi-
tion, several studies have found a correlation with signatures of
T cell states, including signatures of IFNg responses as well as
those of T cell activation, exhaustion, and cytotoxicity (Ayers
et al., 2017; Prat et al., 2017; Riaz et al., 2017); abundance of
partially exhausted CD8+ T cells in responding tumors (Daud
et al., 2016); and magnitude of T cell reinvigoration in relation
to pretreatment tumor burden in blood (Huang et al., 2017).

Additional studies have implicated non-T cell factors, including
PD-L1 protein expression (Larkin et al., 2015); load of tumor neo-
antigens (Rizvi et al., 2015; Snyder et al., 2014); defects in
antigen presentation and IFNg pathways (Gao et al., 2016;
McGranahan et al., 2017; Sade-Feldman et al., 2017; Zaretsky
et al., 2016); and signatures of mesenchymal transition, wound
healing, and angiogenesis (Hugo et al., 2016).
One limitation of many of these studies is that the exact states
of individual cells were not determined, either because bulk tu-
mor biopsies or a limited set of predeﬁned markers were used,
thus limiting our ability to interpret the cellular basis for response
to checkpoint inhibitors. To address these limitations, we
applied high-dimensional single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-
seq) to determine the states of immune cells from dissociated
tumor biopsies of patients treated with checkpoint therapy.
We focused our analysis on two unique states of CD8+ T cells
that predicted the success or failure of checkpoint immuno-
therapy and analyzed the immunological programs and func-
tional properties of these T cells in the context of tumor
immunity.
RESULTS
Single-Cell Proﬁling of Immune Cells in Tumors of
Patients Treated with Checkpoint Inhibitors
To analyze immune cells associated with efﬁcacy of checkpoint
therapies, we performed scRNA-seq on immune cells isolated
from 48 tumor biopsies taken from 32 metastatic melanoma pa-
tients treated with checkpoint therapy (with 35 anti-PD-1, 11
anti-CTLA4+PD-1, and 2 anti-CTLA4 samples), including 11 pa-
tients with longitudinal biopsies and 20 patients with 1 biopsy
(or 2 for one patient), taken either at baseline or during treatment
(Figure 1A; Table S1). We used the following patient response
categories deﬁned by RECIST criteria: complete response (CR)
and partial response (PR) for responders or stable disease (SD)
and progressive disease (PD) for non-responders (Eisenhauer
et al., 2009). However, to relate molecular and cellular variables
with responses of individual lesions to therapy, we classiﬁed
each of the 48 tumor samples based on radiologic assessments
into progression/non-responder (NR; n = 31, including SD/PD
samples) or regression/responder (R; n = 17, including CR/PR
samples) (Table S1). Of 19,392 sorted and sequenced CD45+
cells (using an optimized full-length Smart-seq2 protocol [Villani
et al., 2017] with a median of 1.4 million paired-end reads per
cell), 16,291 cells passed quality control, with a median of
2,588 genes detected per cell (Method Details). Whole-exome
sequencing (WES) available for 20 patient tumor and normal
pairs, identiﬁed four tumors with somatic mutations in B2M,
JAK1, STAT1, and IFNGR1 (Table S1), recently associated with
primary or acquired resistance to checkpoint therapy in mela-
noma (Gao et al., 2016; Sade-Feldman et al., 2017; Zaretsky
et al., 2016).
The Immune Cell Composition of Melanoma Tumors and
Their Association with Response to Checkpoint Therapy
To deﬁne the immune landscape and its association with
outcome in an unbiased manner, unsupervised clustering of
16,291 CD45+ cells was used to identify a robust 11-cluster
solution (Figure S8; Method Details), with two B cell clusters
(G1, B cells; G2, plasma cells), two myeloid clusters (G3, mono-
cytes and/or macrophages; G4, dendritic cells), and seven
clusters enriched for T/NK/NKT cells (G5–11) (Figures 1B and
1C; Table S1). While each patient showed changes in cluster
frequencies between baseline and post-treatment samples
(Table S1), there were no consistent changes when aggregating
all samples (Table S1). When we consider regression or pro-
gression of each lesion, two clusters (G1, p = 0.003; G10,
T cells, p = 0.03; two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test) were
more frequent in responder lesions, while four clusters (G3,
p = 0.003; G4, p = 0.015; G6, T cells, p = 0.005; G11, T/NK
cells, p = 1.3 3 105) were more frequent in non-responder le-
sions (Figure 1D; Table S1). G6 and G11 were both enriched for
genes linked to T cell exhaustion (LAG3, PDCD1, HAVCR2, TI-
GIT, CD38, ENTPD1) and G11 for cell cycle genes (CDK1,
CCNB1, MKI67, CDK4, RB1, TP53) (Table S1). Consistent
with the unsupervised analysis, known signatures of exhausted
and activated T cells (Fuertes Marraco et al., 2015; Wherry
et al., 2007) (Table S1) were enriched in non-responder
(p = 0.002) and responder lesions (p = 2 3 104), respectively
(Figure 1E), with no signiﬁcant change between baseline and
post-therapy samples (Figure S1; Table S1); B cells, CD8+,
and
CD4+
memory
T
cells
were
enriched
in
responder
(p = 0.004, 0.001, and 0.03, respectively; Figures 1F and 1G)
and myeloid cells in non-responder lesions (p = 0.002; Fig-
ure 1F). We also identiﬁed individual markers based on the
fraction of cells expressing a marker in responder versus non-
responder lesions (Figure 1H; Table S1), including PLAC8,
LTB, LY9, SELL, TCF7, IGKC, and CCR7 in responder and
CCL3, CD38, HAVCR2, ENTPD1, and WARS in non-responder
lesions. Our analysis thus identiﬁed speciﬁc cell types, states,
and markers associated with regression or progression of indi-
vidual tumors in response to checkpoint therapy.

Unbiased Deﬁnition of CD8+ T Cell States and Their
Association with Therapy Response
Based on the high frequency of CD8+ T cells and the association
of T cell states with clinical responses, as well as the established
role of CD8+ T cells in recognition of tumor antigens and control
of tumors (Pardoll, 2012; Tumeh et al., 2014), we focused our
analysis on CD8+ T cells. Clustering all CD8+ T cells (n = 6,350)
revealed two major cell states: CD8_G with increased expres-
sion of genes linked to memory, activation, and cell survival
(e.g., IL7R, TCF7, REL, FOXP1, FOSL2, and STAT4) (Hurton
et al., 2016) and reduced expression of co-inhibitory molecules;
and CD8_B enriched for genes linked to cell exhaustion (e.g.,
CD38, HAVCR2, ENTPD1, PDCD1, BATF, LAG3, CTLA4,
and PTPN6) (Figures 2A and 2B; Table S2). CD8_G cells
mapped primarily to G10, G5, and G8 clusters, while CD8_B cells
to G11 and G9 (Figure S2A), and both clusters were found in a
published scRNA-seq dataset of melanoma (Tirosh et al.,
2016) (Figures S2H and S2I; Table S2). CD8_G cells were en-
riched in responding lesions (two-sided Wilcoxon p = 1.4 3
106), while CD8_B cells were enriched in non-responding
lesions (p = 0.005; Figure 2C), with both clusters coexisting
in all lesions. Most responders had a cell-number ratio of
CD8_G/CD8_B > 1, and most non-responders a ratio <1 for
both baseline and post-treatment samples (Figure 2D, S2B,
and S2C). For the nine non-responding lesions with a ratio >1,
we hypothesized that these patients had productive immunity

that selected for tumors with de novo
resistance to checkpoint therapy. Based
on WES, immunohistochemistry, and
ﬂow cytometry, six out of nine samples
(no DNA or slides were available for the
other three) showed complete loss of
B2M or HLA-A,B,C, as previously re-
ported (Sade-Feldman et al., 2017; Zaretsky et al., 2016) (Figures
S2D and S2E; Table S1). We classiﬁed lesions as responders or
non-responders based on CD8_G/CD8 ratios with high predic-
tive power (area under the curve [AUC] of receiver operating
characteristic [ROC] = 0.87; one-sided Wilcoxon p = 1.1 3
105). However, when excluding six samples known to lack
B2M or HLA-A,B,C, the predictive power was boosted (AUC of
ROC = 0.95; p = 3.8 3 107; Figure S2F). We also identiﬁed indi-
vidual CD8+ T cell markers (based on fraction of cells expressing
a marker) (Figures 2E and S2G; Table S2) associated with
response (TCF7, IL7R) and lack of response (e.g., CCL3,
CD38, CLTA, ENTPD1, EPSTI1, FABP5, HAVCR2, NDUFB3,
PDCD1, PRDX3, SIRPG, SNAP47, SNRPD1, UBE2F, and
WARS). These analyses revealed exhausted-like and memory-
like CD8+ T cell states and markers that associate with lesion-
level response to checkpoint therapy.
Elevated Frequencies of TCF7+CD8+ T Cells in Fixed
Tumor Specimens Predict Positive Outcome in an
Independent Anti-PD-1-Treated Cohort
To test our ﬁndings in an independent melanoma cohort (33 pa-
tients treated with anti-PD-1, n = 43 samples) with a different
method, we stained ﬁxed sections for CD8 and TCF7, a top
marker associated with responding lesions and expressed
frequently in CD8_G cells (Table S3). TCF7 is part of the Wnt/
b-catenin signaling pathway and is crucial for differentiation,

self-renewal, and persistence of memory CD8+ T cells (Zhou
et al., 2010) and reinvigoration and effective immunity of CD8+
T cells against chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis mouse vi-
rus (LCMV) infection upon anti-PD-1 treatment (Im et al., 2016;
Utzschneider et al., 2016). Based on automated image analysis
with CellProﬁler (Carpenter et al., 2006) (Figures 3A and 3B;
File S1), we found more TCF7+CD8+ cells in responding (two-
sided Wilcoxon p = 3.9 3 106) and more TCF7CD8+ cells in
non-responding (p = 1.1 3 108; Figures 3C and 3D) samples.
Most responders had a ratio of TCF7+CD8+ to TCF7CD8+ cell
number >1 while non-responders had a ratio <1 in all (n = 43;
one-sided Wilcoxon p = 2.4 3 106), baseline (n = 24;
p = 0.001), or post-treatment (n = 19; p = 1.7 3 104; Figure 3E)
samples. In contrast, the frequency of tumor-associated CD8+
T cells was not different between responder and non-responder
patients (Figure 3F), as we found in the single-cell analysis (Table
S1). The power to classify responses based on immunoﬂuores-
cence analysis was high for all (AUC of ROC = 0.91), baseline
(AUC of ROC = 0.88), or post-treatment samples (AUC of
ROC = 0.98; Figure 3G). Finally, patients with a ratio >1 survived
longer than those with a ratio <1 (Kaplan-Meier [KM] log rank
p = 0.03, Figure 3H). Thus, staining of the TCF7 protein in
CD8+ T cells may serve as a useful and practical marker of
clinical outcome in patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy.
Fine Clustering of CD8+ T Cells
While the two CD8+ T cell clusters were sufﬁcient to separate re-
sponders from non-responders, unsupervised clustering further
deﬁned six sub-clusters, with three that are mostly contained
within CD8_G and three within CD8_B (Figures 4A–4C; Method
Details). CD8_1 cells expressed markers of exhaustion and cell
cycle (Table S4; similar to G11; Table S1), similar to terminally ex-
hausted CD39+ (ENTPD1) CD8+ T cells from chronic infection
with hepatitis C virus (Gupta et al., 2015). CD8_2 cells expressed
many of the same exhaustion markers along with heat shock
proteins (HSPB1, HSPA1A, and HSPA4) and additional inhibitory
receptors (ENTPD1 and KIR2DL4). CD8_3 cells expressed the
known exhaustion markers (HAVCR2, CD38, PDCD1, and
PTPN6) but lacked heat shock and cell-cycle genes. CD8_4
(CCR7, IL7R, TCF7, TNF, and S100A10) and CD8_6 (SELL,
TCF7, LTB, IL7R, FLT3LG, and IL16) cells were consistent with
a memory- and/or effector-like phenotype, while CD8_5 cells
had the phenotypes of memory and early activated cells
(IL6ST, CXCL13, IL7R, and CTLA4) with higher HAVCR2 and
PDCD1 compared to CD8_4,6 but lower than CD8_1,2,3 (Fig-
ure S3A). Interestingly, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1 had much
higher expression in CD8_1,2,3 (Table S4), resembling programs
previously reported in melanoma (Tirosh et al., 2016), in a mouse
model of chronic LCMV infection (Wherry et al., 2007), and in
resident memory T cells (Mami-Chouaib et al., 2018). CD8_1
and CD8_3 were enriched in non-responder (one-sided Wil-
coxon p = 6.7 3 105 and p = 0.001, respectively), while
CD8_4 and CD8_5 were enriched in responder lesions when
excluding samples deﬁcient for B2M or HLA-A,B,C (p = 0.01
and p = 0.02, respectively; Figure 4D). CD8_5 was found mostly
in post-therapy samples (80%; Figures S3B and S3C) and ap-
peared to have fewer TCF7-expressing cells relative to CD8_4
and CD8_6 (Figure S3A). However, it split into two sub-clusters
(Figure
4E):
CD8_5.1
(TCF7+GZMB)
and
CD8_5.2
(TCF7GZMB+) cells, both enriched in responder lesions (one-
sided Wilcoxon p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). These ﬁnd-
ings are consistent with a recent study showing that loss of TCF7
expression is associated with acquisition of effector phenotype
in response to anti-PD-1 treatment in a mouse model of LCMV
infection (Im et al., 2016). Since T cells transition to new states
in cancer or chronic infections (Im et al., 2016; Speiser et al.,
2016), we used trajectory analysis (Qiu et al., 2017) to identify a
main trajectory branch and two side branches (Figure 4F), re-
ﬂecting a possible path for differentiation (CD8_4, CD8_6,
CD8_5 followed by CD8_3, CD8_2, and CD8_1, with some over-
lap of clusters and with no information on the directionality) (Fig-
ures 4F, S3D, and S3E). The ﬁnding of transitional cells and the
proximity between clusters suggests states that may arise or
give rise to others. Our analysis of ﬁner T cell states is consistent
with our ﬁndings of the two CD8+ T cell clusters but provides bet-
ter resolution of cell states and suggests testable paths for
differentiation.
TIM3 and ENTPD1 Mark the Exhausted-like State of
CD8+ T Cells
To isolate cells with the different CD8+ T cell states using ﬂow
sorting, we used the cell surface markers, CD39 (ENTPD1) and
TIM3 (HAVCR2), which both had low expression in clusters asso-
ciated with response and high expression in those associated
with no response (Figures S3A and S4A; Tables S2 and S4) .
We used scRNA-seq to proﬁle freshly sorted CD39+TIM3+ (DP,
double positive) and CD39TIM3 (DN, double negative) CD8+
T cells from four melanoma patients (Figure S4B; Table S5)
and found that the proﬁles recapitulated the original unsorted
clusters (Figures 5A and 5B)—DN with CD8_4 and 6, and DP
mostly with CD8_2 cells. Since CD39 is an ectonucleotidase in
the adenosine pathway that modulates immunity (Young et al.,
2014), a marker for terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells in patients
with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infections (Gupta
et al., 2015), and a marker of exhaustion in tumor-inﬁltrating

2018), we analyzed the properties of CD8+CD39+ from 12 mela-
noma patients treated with checkpoint blockade therapy (Table
S5). We found that while CD8+CD39+ and CD8+CD39 T cells
had equal expression of PD-1, CD39 turned out to be a key
marker that separates all TIM3+ from TIM3 cells (Figure S4C),
the latter being reported as a marker of T cell dysfunction in can-
cer and chronic infections (Anderson et al., 2016). We prepared
single-cell suspensions from the 12 patients and assessed their
ability to produce cytokines in response to T cell receptor (TCR)
(anti-CD3/CD28) stimulation. While CD39 and CD39+ cells con-
tained equivalent percentages of IL-2-producing cells, CD39+
cells had a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of TNF⍺- (un-
paired-Student’s t test p = 0.0016) and IFNg-producing cells
(p = 5 3 104; Figure 5C).
To address which of the two cell states (DN or DP) is important
for tumor eradication upon anti-PD-1 therapy, we used a
CT26GFP+ mouse tumor cell-line that exhibits modest regression
when treated with anti-PD-1 in an ex-vivo three dimensional (3D)
microﬂuidic culture system for growing murine organotypic tu-
mor spheroids (MDOTS) (Jenkins et al., 2018). We found anti-
PD-1-mediated killing using this system was dependent on
both CD8+ T cells and IFNg (Figure 5D). Next, we isolated
CD8+CD39TIM3 (DN) and CD8+CD39+TIM3+ (DP) cells from
CT26GFP+ tumors and immediately incubated each population
or a mixed one (DN/DP, 1:1 ratio) in the device with the MDOTS
for 5 days with anti-PD-1 (or anti-IgG control antibodies), fol-
lowed by live/dead staining and ﬂuorescence microscopy to
evaluate the viability of the CT26GFP+ MDOTS (Figure S4D). Addi-
tion of DN cells (which were also TCF7+) induced the most cell
death, with 50% of GFP+ tumor cells eradicated after 5 days
with anti-PD-1 antibodies, while DP cells reduced killing to con-
trol (IgG) levels (Figure 5D). We conclude that expression of
CD39 and TIM3 discriminated exhausted from memory and/or
effector cells, with DN cells supporting antitumor activity of
checkpoint blockade ex vivo.
Dual Inhibition of TIM3 and CD39 Reduces Tumor
Growth and Improves Survival
Because cells expressing CD39 and TIM3 were associated with
non-responding lesions, and their expression was highly corre-
lated with each other (relative to all pairwise correlations be-
tween top CD8_B markers; Table S5), we examined the
combined effect of CD39 and TIM3 blockade. Mice transplanted
with B16-F10 melanoma were treated with a small molecule,
POM-1, that inhibits CD39 activity (Sun et al., 2010) and/or
anti-TIM3 blocking antibodies (Figure 5E). While either mono-
therapy transiently reduced tumor growth through day 14, the
combination strongly reduced tumor size and increased survival
at day 40 to 20% versus 0% for monotherapy (Figures 5F, 5G,
S4E, and S4F). Combining POM-1 treatment with anti-PD-1 or
anti-PD-1/CTLA4 also reduced tumor growth and increased sur-
vival, with POM1/PD-1/CTLA4 therapy having a strong synergis-
tic boost of survival at day 40 to 60% (Figures 5H–5K and S4G–
S4J). The effects of POM-1 were dependent on CD8+ but not
CD4+ T cells (Figures S5A–S5E) and led to higher frequencies
of IFNg- but not GZMB/PRF1-producing CD8+ T cells (un-
paired-Student’s t test p = 0.04) and higher T cell proliferation
in response to TCR stimulation (Figures S5F–S5I). While surface
CD39 levels were not altered by POM-1 in CD8+ and B16-
F10GFP+ cells (Figure S5J), ATP levels increased in whole tumor
(p = 0.02) or B16-F10GFP+ cells (p = 0.02; Figure S5K), suggesting
that CD39 ATPase is active in B16-F10 tumors. These results are
consistent with prior studies in which inhibition of CD39 enzy-
matic activity enhances proliferation of T cells (Bastid et al.,
2015). Altogether, we observed enhanced tumor control when
targeting CD39 in combination with TIM3 or other checkpoints,
providing new and effective therapeutic combinations.
Chromatin States of Exhausted-like and Memory-like
CD8+ T Cells
To better understand the transcriptional regulation that explains
the signatures observed in the exhausted-like and memory-like
CD8+ T cells, DP and DN cells were isolated from ﬁve metastatic
melanoma patients (Table S5), and open chromatin was quanti-
ﬁed by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using
sequencing (ATAC-seq) and transcript levels by scRNA-seq (Fig-
ure 6A). Of the differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs)
by scRNA-seq, DN cells expressed higher levels of TCF7,
STAT4, FOXP1, and FOSB transcripts, as observed for stem
cell memory CD8+ T cells (Hurton et al., 2016), and DP cells ex-
pressed higher BATF, PRDM1, TOX, HMGB2, and IRF2, as
described for exhausted CD8+ T cells (Waugh et al., 2016;
Wherry et al., 2007) (Figure 6B). These TFs were also detected
in single cells sorted computationally based on expression of
CD39 and TIM3 mRNAs as well as in the original CD8_G and
CD8_B clusters (Figures S6A and S6B). ATAC-seq identiﬁed
differentially accessible regions in genes related to exhaustion
and memory (Figures 6C, 6D, and S6C), with a smaller number
in DN cells (424; Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate
[FDR] < 0.01; Table S5) when compared to DP cells (858;
FDR < 0.01; Table S5), consistent with a previous study showing
increased open regions as cells differentiate in response to
chronic LCMV infection (Sen et al., 2016). Next, we searched
for TF motifs enriched in open chromatin peaks and found
BATF (and other TFs) motifs enriched in DP peaks and TCF7
and FOXP1 motifs in DN peaks (Figure 6E). EOMES was highly
expressed in DP cells consistent with previous studies (Paley
et al., 2012; Wherry et al., 2007); however, differential peak motif

enrichment was found in DN cells, suggesting that TF activity
and expression are not coupled. Since BATF and TCF7 had
the highest peak motif enrichment and the highest expression
in DP and DN, respectively (Figures 6E and S6D), we compared
whether differentially expressed genes near signiﬁcant (FDR <
0.01) open chromatin regions (OCR) in DP or DN cells (as deﬁned
by GREAT [McLean et al., 2010]) contain enhancers with BATF or
TCF7 motifs. We identiﬁed 95 genes in DP (16%, including
CXCL13, ENTPD1, CD38, CTLA4, and HAVCR2) and 6 genes
in DN cells (20%, including IL7R, PLAC8, and SELL), out of the
total differentially expressed genes (584 for DP and 30 for DN),
that meet these criteria (Figure 6F), suggesting that both BATF
and TCF7 control the expression of key genes unique to each
cell state. Furthermore, BATF was associated with non-
responder lesions when looking at all cells (Fisher’s exact test
p = 7.2 3 1049; Table S1) or CD8+ cells (p = 8.1 3 1019; Table
S2), and TCF7 with responder lesions (all CD45+, p = 8.03 3
1050; CD8+, p = 3.02 3 1020). Finally, we compared open chro-
matin in DP and DN cells to those of recently reported dysfunc-
tional PD-1highCD8+ cells and central memory cells (CD45RAC-
D45RO+CD62Llo) (Philip et al., 2017). We found an overlap of DP
with PD-1highCD8+ and DN with central memory cells but with
some unique peaks in each (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR < 0.01;
Figure S6E; Table S5), showing that they share some of their pro-
grams. Our analysis reveals key regulatory elements and TFs
that regulate the exhaustion-like and memory-like programs in
CD8+ T cells found in human melanoma.
TCR Analysis Identiﬁes Patterns of Expansion
Associated with Cell States and Clinical Outcome
We reconstructed TCR sequences for all identiﬁed CD8+ T cells
and deﬁned four patterns of TCR clonality based on shared
CDR3 sequences in both ⍺and b chains (Figure 7A; Method De-
tails): persistent TCRs detected in pre- and post-therapy sam-
ples from the same patient, enriched TCRs detected in more
than one T cell in a single sample, singlet TCRs found in only
one T cell at one time point, and common TCRs shared across
two or more patients. Since the overall number of persistent
TCRs was very low, especially in responders, we could not
make many conclusions about their relationships to clinical
response; still, we detected a signiﬁcant enrichment for persis-
tent TCRs in non-responders in clusters CD8_3 (two-sided Wil-
coxon p = 0.01) and CD8_6 (p = 0.006) (Figure 7B), and when
aggregating exhaustion clusters (CD8_1,2,3, p = 0.02) but not
the memory and/or effector ones (Figure 7C). Interestingly,
very few persistent TCRs were detected in the CD8_5 cluster
(which was present predominantly in post-therapy samples)
when looking at all patient CD8+ cells (Figure 7D), suggesting
that these T cell clones did not exist prior to therapy. Enriched
TCRs were more common in exhausted clusters and singlet
TCRs in effector and/or memory clusters (Figures 7G and 7J),
but both were enriched in non-responders for CD8_1,2,3 and
in responders for CD8_4,5,6 (Figures 7F and 7I). We hypothesize
that enriched TCRs are likely to have been exposed to persistent
tumor antigen stimulation, explaining their higher proportions in
the exhausted than in the effector and/or memory clusters, while
singlet TCRs are not as expanded because they are more
recently generated against tumor antigens (or are bystanders)
and have fewer exhaustion markers. Although common TCRs
were predominantly present in clusters CD8_2 and 3, no
signiﬁcant association was found with clinical outcome (Figures
7K–7M). Collectively, this analysis allowed us to connect the
transcriptional phenotype of cells and therapeutic outcomes
with TCR clonality and could aid in investigating T cell
dynamics and cell state plasticity. Indeed, when looking at the
transitions of T cell states (CD8_1,2,3,4,5,6) within a speciﬁc
clone (based on identical TCR sequence) across longitudinal
samples in the same patient (Table S6), we discovered bilateral
transitions between exhausted and memory and/or effector
states.
DISCUSSION
Although immune checkpoint blockade leads to durable re-
sponses in patients with metastatic melanoma, refractory dis-
ease and progression after initial response remain major causes
of mortality (Larkin et al., 2015; Robert et al., 2015). By proﬁling
single immune cells in baseline and on- or post-therapy samples
in melanoma patients treated with checkpoint therapy, we iden-
tiﬁed and characterized several CD8+ T cell states associated
with lesion growth and studied their properties using a series
of molecular and functional experiments.
A central ﬁnding from our study is that the presence of TCF7
protein in CD8+ T cells can predict clinical response to check-
point therapy, suggesting that the state of T cells, in addition to
the number of T cells and their spatial distribution (Galon et al.,
2006; Mahmoud et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2007), found in a pa-
tient’s tumor is critical for induction of effective tumor immunity.
Consistent with our ﬁndings, TCF7 (TCF1 in mice) is required for
reinvigorating CD8+ T cells in response to PD-1 blockade to
resolve chronic LCMV infection (Im et al., 2016; Utzschneider
et al., 2016), and for the expansion of CXCR5+TIM3CD8+
T cells (but not TIM3+cells) for control of virus in mice (Im et al.,
2016), although we did not observe CXCR5 expression in
TCF7+ cells in human melanoma. Finally, our results also agree
with recent studies showing a reduction in open chromatin re-
gions
at
TCF7
sites
in
non-programmable,
dysfunctional
PD-1high T cells (Philip et al., 2017) and with the importance of
TCF7 role for WNT signaling in stem cell-like memory cells (Gat-
tinoni et al., 2009).
In contrast to TCF7+CD8+ T cells, we found cells expressing
exhausted or dysfunctional signatures associated with lack of
response to checkpoint therapy. Our ﬁnding of CD39 (an enzyme
in the adenosine pathway) as a marker of exhausted CD8+ T cells
is consistent with recent observations in melanoma (Canale
et al., 2018) and HCV- and HIV-infected patients (Gupta et al.,

2015). The ability of CD39 inhibitors together with TIM3, PD-1, or
PD-1/CTLA4 blockade to reduce tumor growth and increase sur-
vival of mice with B16-F10 tumors is consistent with studies us-
ing checkpoint blockade with inhibitors of CD73 (a downstream
component of the adenosine pathway) (Allard et al., 2013) and
suggests new therapeutic combinations for treating melanoma
and other cancers.
Some studies used bulk tumor expression data to identify
several signatures (IFNg, exhaustion, cytotoxicity, antigen
presentation, and others) that associate with outcome (Ayers

et al., 2017; Prat et al., 2017; Riaz et al., 2017). However, since
many distinct signatures are upregulated at the same time in re-
sponders, one interpretation of these ﬁndings is that the bulk
transcriptome change (which mixes many immune and non-im-
mune cells together) likely reﬂects an overall increase in the
T cell inﬁltrate and does not discriminate speciﬁc T cell states.
Consistent with this notion, we ﬁnd that signatures of CD8_G
and CD8_B, as well as known markers of T cell states (ex-
hausted, effector, memory), are equally correlated with CD3
transcript number in samples from these cohorts (Figure S7).
We also show evidence that T cells can transition between
states based on identical TCRs in T cells from exhausted-like
and memory-like states, but we do not know the order or the
exact transitions between states. Surprisingly, we found that
CD 8_5 T cells, which were predominantly found in post-therapy
tumor samples, hardly share TCRs with the baseline sample,
suggesting that members of the CD8_5 cluster are generated
outside of the tumor and subsequently migrate to the tumor,
consistent with observations from a recent study (Spitzer et al.,
2017) demonstrating that lymphoid-organ-derived T cells are
required for anti-PD-1 potency.
Future studies will need to purify cells in each of the different
T cell states based on surface protein markers (which may not
always correlate with transcripts), validate their purity by
scRNA-seq, and study their properties (as we did for some of
the states here). Indeed, we identiﬁed a T cell state associated
with response and showed that CD39TIM3CD8+ T cells (which
are TCF7+) contribute to the antitumor activity of anti-PD-1 ther-
apy in culture, but we have not yet determined which cells kill the
tumors, the role of PD-1 in this process, or the factors that induce
or attract TCF7+ T cells.
Our ﬁnding that speciﬁc memory-like signatures are associ-
ated with response—together with recent studies showing that
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell activity is enhanced by
generating more memory-like cells through IL-7 or IL-15 path-
ways, leading to better outcome in preclinical models (Hurton
et al., 2016; Shum et al., 2017)—suggests that methods to in-
crease the ratio of CD8_G to CD8_B would enhance immuno-
therapies. Indeed, we were able to increase ex vivo tumor killing
by removal of CD39+TIM3+CD8+ T cells (from tumor inﬁltrates)
prior to treatment with anti-PD-1.
Building on the results and datasets presented here, one can
envision designing trials that select patients for anti-PD-1 ther-
apy based on T cell states and markers and then testing whether
this strategy increases the rate of durable responses. In addition,
it may be possible to use the change in the ratio of T cell states as
an assay to prioritize therapeutic approaches prior to anti-PD-1
therapy. Future studies will also need to test whether our predic-
tive markers of response are relevant to other types of malig-
nancies and therapies.

Mice
Female C57BL/6 or BALB/cJ mice, age of 8-9 weeks were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and were housed at Massachusetts
General Hospital under SPF conditions. All experiments followed protocols approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Insti-
tutional Animal Care and use Committee (IACUC).
In vivo tumor transplant experiments
B16-F10 and CT26 cells were generously provided by Mikael Pittet and Umar Mahamood respectively. B16-F10 or B16-F10GFP+ cells
(0.5x106) were intradermally injected into the right ﬂank using a 30 g needle and tumors were measured every 4 days in two dimen-
sions using a digital caliper. Tumor volume (mm3) was calculated using the following formula V = (L * W2)/2 (V = volume, L = tumor
length, tumor width). For MDOTS experiments, CT26GFP+cells (2x106) were subcutaneously injected into the right ﬂank using a 27 g
needle and tumors were harvested 14 days post transplantation. All blocking treatments started on day 4 post transplantation after
100% of tumors were visible. Invivo plus rat IgG2a isotype control (BioXCell; 2A3; BE0089) 100mg/dose was intraperitoneally (i.p.)
injected to the control (untreated) group every 3 days. Invivo plus anti-mouse TIM3 (BioXCell; RMT3-23; BE0115) 100mg/dose, Invivo
plus anti-mouse PD-1 (BioXCell; 29F.1A12; BE0273) 200mg/dose and Invivo plus anti-mouse CTLA4 (BioXCell; 9D9; BE0164)
100mg/dose were i.p. injected every 3 days. POM-1 (polyoxometalate-1) 5mg/kg/day (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-203205), a
CD39 inhibitor, was i.p. injected on a daily basis, starting on day 4 post transplantation.
METHOD DETAILS
Sample dissociation
Fresh isolated tumor samples were collected immediately after surgery and were dissociated within 1 hour using the human tumor
dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec; 130-095-929) with the following modiﬁcations. Tissue was minced into small pieces using a scalpel
and put into a 1.5ml eppendorf tube containing 100ml of enzyme H, 50ml of enzyme R, 12.5ml of enzyme A (all provided in the kit), and
837.5ml of RPMI, followed by a 20 minute incubation in a thermomixer (Eppendorf; F1.5) at 37C, 600 rpm. After incubation, debris
were removed by ﬁltering through a 70mm cell strainer, followed by mincing of the remaining tissue left on the strainer with a plunger in
order to increase cell yield. Dissociated cells were subsequently washed with cold 1X PBS containing 1.5% heat inactivated FCS,
spun down at 1300 rpm, 4C for 5 minutes, resuspended, and counted for yield and viability with trypan blue using a Countess auto-
mated cell counter (Invitrogen).
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
For both ﬂow cytometry and cell sorting, Human or mouse TrueStain FcX (Biolegend, 422302 or 101320) was used for blocking Fc
receptors before labeling cells. To discriminate live from dead cells, we used Zombie Violet Dye (Biolegend, 423114) or Zombie Green
(Biolegend, 423111) for 15 min at 4C, followed by surface labeling of cells for 30 min at 4C, using standard protocols. The antibodies
used for cell surface labeling were PE anti-human CD45 (Biolegend, 304008), APC anti-human CD3 (Biolegend, 300412), FITC anti-
human HLA-A,B,C (Biolegend, 311404), APC/Cy7 anti-human CD235a (Biolegend, 349116), PE/Cy5 anti-human CD3 (Biolegend,
300309), BV421 anti-human PD-1 (Biolegend, 329919), PE/Cy7 anti-human TIM3 (Biolegend, 345013), APC/Cy7 anti-human
CD39 (Biolegend, 328226), AF700 anti-human CD4 (Biolegend, 317425) and BV650 anti-human CD8 (biolegend, 301041). Antibodies
used for cell surface of mouse cells were AF647 anti-mouse CD39 (Biolegend, 143808), BV605 or Paciﬁc blue anti-mouse CD3 (Bio-
legend, 100351 or 100334), PE/Cy5 or FITC anti-mouse CD8a (Biolegend, 100710 or 100705), APC/Cy7 anti-mouse CD4 (Biolegend,
100414), BV650 or FITC anti-mouse CD45.2 (Biolegend, 109836 or 109806) and APC or Paciﬁc Blue anti-mouse Thy1.2 (Biolegend,
140312 or 105324). The antibodies used for intracellular staining were FITC anti-human IFNg (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-097-936), PE anti-
human IL2 (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-099-391), APC anti-human TNF⍺(Miltenyi Biotec, 130-099-197), APC anti-mouse TNF⍺(Biolegend,
506307), PE anti-mouse IL2 (Biolegend, 503807), FITC anti-mouse IFNg (Biolegend, 505805), PE anti-mouse Perforin-1 (Biolegend,
154305) and APC anti-mouse Granzyme-B (Biolegend, 372203). Intracellular cellular labeling for granzyme-B and perforin-1 was per-
formed following surface staining, ﬁxation and permeabilization using the BD Transcription Factor Buffer Set (BD, 562574) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sorting of single cells was performed on a BD Fusion instrument using the following antibody
panel: Zombie dye, CD45, CD235a and HLA-A,B,C. CD45+ cells from dissociated samples were sorted into 96-well plates (Eppen-
dorf, 951020401) containing 10ml of lysis buffer (TCL buffer, QIAGEN 1031576, supplemented with 1% b-mercaptoethanol), sealed,
vortexed, spun down at 2500 rpm for 30 s, immediately placed on dry ice, and then stored at 80C until processing with the Smart-
Seq2 protocol. Sorting of human and mouse CD8+CD39+TIM+(DP) and CD8+CD39-TIM3-(DN) was performed using the following
antibody panel: Zombie dye, CD45, CD3, CD8, CD39, and TIM3. For ﬂow cytometry, we used the Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX in-
strument and analyzed the data with FlowJo 10.4.2 software.
Single cell RNA sequencing procedure
Libraries from single cell lysates were generated with the Smart-Seq2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2013) with some modiﬁcations in the
reverse transcription step as recently described (Villani et al., 2017). 96-well plates containing cell lysates were thawed on ice,
spun down at 1500 rpm for 30 s, and mixed with Agencourt RNAClean XP SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter) for RNA puriﬁcation. Pu-
riﬁed RNA was resuspended in 4ml of Mix-1, denatured at 72C for 3 min and placed immediately on ice for 1 min before 7ml of Mix-2
Cell 175, 998–1013.e1–e9, November 1, 2018
e4

was added (Table S6). Reverse transcription was carried out at 50C for 90 min, followed by 5 min incubation at 85C. 14ml of Mix-3
was added in each well and the whole-transcriptome ampliﬁcation step was performed at 98C for 3 min, followed by 21 cycles at
(98C for 15 s, 67C for 20 s and 72C for 6 min), and ﬁnal extension at 72C for 5min. cDNA was then puriﬁed with Agencourt
AMPureXP SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter) as described (Villani et al., 2017), to remove all primer dimers residues. Quality control
steps were performed on samples before library construction and included the following steps: (1) concentration measurements, us-
ing the Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity assay kit on the Synergy H1 Hybrid Microplate Reader (BioTek); (2) cDNA size distribution using
the High-Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer Kit (Table S6). Libraries were generated using the Nextera XT Library Prep kit (Illumina) with
custom indexing adapters (Villani et al., 2017) in a 384-well PCR plate, followed by a cleanup step to remove residual primer dimers.
Combined libraries from 384 cells were then sequenced on a NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina), using paired-end 38-base reads.
Immunoﬂuorescence assay and analysis
Multiplex staining was performed on 4mm formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded sections using the Opal multiplex IHC system
(PerkinElmer; NEL800001KT) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, slides were baked for 1 hour at 65C followed
by deparafﬁnization with xylene and a graded series of ethanol dilutions (100%, 95% and 70%), ﬁxation with 10% neutral buffered
formalin for 30 minutes, microwave antigen retrieval using the AR9 buffer (PerkinElmer; AR900250ML), and blocking. Primary anti-
bodies used for staining were: CD8a (Biolegend; C8/144B; 372902; 1:100) detected with OPAL520 (1:100; Cy2); TCF7 (Cell Signaling;
#2203; 1:100) detected with OPAL690 (1:100; Cy5.5). Counterstain was done using DAPI (1:1000) and subsequently mounted using
Vectashield (Vectra; H-1000) ﬂuorescence media. Slides were imaged using the Olympus IX83 confocal microscope by scanning 10
random ﬁelds on each sample at 40X magniﬁcation, and analyzed with CellProﬁler 2.2.0 (Carpenter et al., 2006) to detect the total
number of nuclei, CD8+, TCF7+, and CD8+TCF7+ cells. Due to cellular heterogeneity between different slides/patients, in each sample
the percentage of CD8+TCF7- or CD8+TCF7+ was calculated out of the total nuclei detected. For the analysis, a new pipeline was
made for detection of cells positive for CD8 and TCF7 (File S1).
Immunohistochemistry
Procedures were done on the automated Ventana Discovery Ultra staining system, using 4mm formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded
sections. Sections were deparafﬁnized in xylene and graded alcohols, followed by antigen retrieval (EDTA), blocking with Discovery
inhibitor (Ventana; 760-4840), incubation with primary antibodies for 16 minutes, washing and incubation with a secondary antibody
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Sections were developed with discovery purple chromogen kit (Ventana; 760-229)
and were then counterstained with hematoxylin. Primary antibodies used were: B2M (Abcam; ab27588; 1:1000); anti melanoma triple
cocktail (Ventana; 790-4677; 1:100) containing antibodies against melanosome (HMB45), Mart-1/melan A (A103), tyrosinase (T311).
The melanoma triple cocktail was used to separate tumor from normal cells enabling detection of B2M in the cancerous cell fraction.
Intracellular cytokine detection
For intracellular cytokine analysis of human CD8+ T cells, 5x105 cells from dissociated samples (n = 12) were cultured in the presence
of soluble LEAF puriﬁed anti-CD3 (Biolegend, 317303, 2mg/ml), anti-CD28 (Biolegend, 302913, 1mg/ml) and GolgiPlug (BD, 555029)
for 6 hours at 37C. Intracellular cytokine labeling was performed following surface staining, ﬁxation and permeabilization using the
BD Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm Plus kit (BD, 555028) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Generation of B16-F10GFP+ and CT26GFP+ cells
B16-F10 and CT26 cell lines were transduced with the lenti-GFP+virus FUGW (a gift from David Baltimore; Addgene, 14883) (Lois
et al., 2002), and GFPhigh-positive cells were sorted on day +5 to generate B16-F10GFP+and CT26GFP+cells. Before each experiment
the percentage of GFP+ cells was evaluated by ﬂow-cytometry. For lentivirus production 293T cells were transfected with psPAX2
(a gift from Didier Trono; Addgene, 12260), FUGW and pMD2.G (a gift from Didier Trono; Addgene, 12259) at a 10:10:1 ratio using
TransIT-LT1 reagent (MIRUS, MIR2300) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
In vivo depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
For depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 400mg/dose of Invivo mAb anti-mouse CD8a (BioXCell; 2.43; BE0061), 400mg/dose Invivo
mAb anti-mouse CD4 (BioXCell; GK1.5; BE0003-1) or 400mg/dose rat IgG2b isotype control (BioXCell; LTF-2; BE0090), were i.p in-
jected every 3 days, starting from day +7 post tumor transplantation until day +21. Depletion efﬁcacy was evaluated on day +14 by
ﬂow cytometry analysis.
Ex vivo culture and live/dead imaging of Murine-derived Organotypic Tumor Spheroids
CT26GFP+ tumors from untreated BALB/cJ mice were harvested on day +14 following implantation. Murine-derived organotypic tu-
mor spheroids (MDOTS) (S2 fraction; 40-100mm) isolation was performed as previously described (Jenkins et al., 2018). Following
isolation, MDOTS were resuspended in type I rat tail collagen and the spheroid-collagen mixture was injected into the center gel re-
gion of the 3D microﬂuidic culture device (10ml per AIM device). After incubation (30 min, 37C in sterile humidity chambers), the
collagen-MDOTS mixture was hydrated with media (10% FBS in RPMI) with the indicated therapeutic monoclonal antibodies: isotype
control IgG2a (10mg/ml, BioXCell, BE0089), anti-PD-1 (10mg/ml, BioXCell, BE0146), anti-IFNg (10mg/ml, BioXCell, BE0054), and
e5
Cell 175, 998–1013.e1–e9, November 1, 2018

anti-CD8a (10mg/ml, BioXcell, BE0004-1). For TIM3/CD39 subpopulation studies, sorted CD8+ double-positive derived from the S3
(< 40mm) MDOTS fraction (DP; CD39+TIM3+), double-negative (DN; CD39-TIM3-) and mixed (1:1 mixture of DP and DN cells) popu-
lations were pelleted and resuspended in MDOTS/collagen mixture at an estimated effector:target (E:T) ratio of 1:3-1:4 (based on
estimated 10,000 cells per device). MDOTS were cultured in the DAX-1 3-D cell culture chip from AIM Biotech, as described (Jen-
kins et al., 2018). On day +5 live/dead ﬂuorescence staining was performed as previously described (Jenkins et al., 2018) with the
following modiﬁcations. After incubation with Hoechst/PI (40 min, 37oC, 5% CO2) images were obtained. Image-capture and anal-
ysis were performed using a Nikon Eclipse 80i ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with Z stack (Prior), motorized stage (ProScan)
and ZYLA5.5 sCMOS camera (Andor) and NIS-Elements AR software package. Live/dead cell quantiﬁcation was performed by
measuring total cell area of each dye in GFP-positive CT26 cells.
CFSE labeling and ex vivo proliferation assay
Single cell suspensions (10x106) of digested B16-F10GFP+ tumors isolated on day 14 post implantation (from POM-1 treated and un-
treated mice) were incubated with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) containing 5mM CFSE (Biolegend, 423801) for 10 min at 37C. Heat
inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) was then added for 1 min, and cells were washed three times in RPMI + 10% FCS. CFSE-labeled
cells (3x105) were seeded in triplicates in a 96-ﬂat bottom plate with or without the presence of 1mg/ml anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies
(Biolegend, 100314 and 102112) for 72h. The number of cell divisions of Thy1.2+CD8+ cells was determined by ﬂow-cytometry
analysis.
Intra-tumoral ATP level measurements
Intra-ATP levels were measured immediately either in total single cell suspensions of digested B16-F10GFP+ tumors or sorted B16-
F10GFP+ cells (1x105), isolated from POM-1 treated and untreated mice on day 14, using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability
Assay (Promega, G7571) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. ATP levels were measured (in triplicates) using the Synergy
H1M plate reader (BioTek), and its concentration was calculated using an ATP standard curve.
ATAC-seq tagmentation
Methods for tagmentation are as previously reported (Corces et al., 2016). Brieﬂy, 5,000-10,000 cells were cell sorted into RPMI con-
taining 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, 1% L-Glutamine, and 1% HEPES. The cells were then centrifuged at 500xg at 4C for 10 minutes,
the supernatant aspirated, and resuspended in tagmentation mixture (25 ml tagmentation buffer (Illumina, FC-121-1031), 2.5 ml TBE
(Illumina, FC-121-1031), 0.5 ml 1% digitonin (Promega, G9441), and 22 ml H2O). The cells were then incubated at 37C in a thermo-
mixer, mixing at 300 RPM for 30 min. Following tagmentation, the sample was immediately puriﬁed via minElute PCR cleanup column
(QIAGEN, 28006), and eluted in 10 ml. The tagmented DNA was then PCR’ed using Nextera indexing primers with sequencing
adapters for 5 cycles in a 50 ml reaction. 5 ml of the reaction was then used for qPCR to determine the remaining number of PCR cycles
required (as determined by the cycle number of each sample when it reaches 1/3 the ﬂuorescence threshold), followed by PCR of
each individual sample according to this cycle number. The samples were puriﬁed using 1.5X Agencourt AMPure XP beads
(A63880), followed by two 70% EtOH washes, and elution of DNA in 15 ml buffer EB (QIAGEN, 19086). Each sample was quantiﬁed
by Qubit, and measured for fragment lengths on a Tape Station. The samples were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq
500 using 75 bp PE reads to a sequencing depth of 30 million reads per sample.
Whole exome sequencing
Whole exome sequencing (WES) of DNA from tumor and matched normal blood samples was done as previously described (Sade-
Feldman et al., 2017). Brieﬂy, 250-500ng of extracted DNA, using QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (cat# 80204), was used as input
for library preparation. Sample were barcoded using unique 8 base molecular barcodes followed by a library enrichment process,
and all libraries above 40ng/ml were considered acceptable for solution-phase hybrid selection and sequencing. Libraries preparation
was carried out using the SureSelect Target Enrichment System Sequencing Platform Library Prep v2 (Agilent Technologies, G3360-
90000), according to manufacturer’s speciﬁcations, followed by quantiﬁcation and normalization using PicoGreen to ensure equal
concentration. Libraries were then quantiﬁed using qPCR (KAPA Biosystems, KK4832), denturated with 0.2M NaOH and diluted
to 20pM using hybridization buffer (Illumina). Cluster ampliﬁcation was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina),
HiSeq 2500 v4 cluster chemistry and ﬂowcells, as well as Illumina’s Multiplexing Sequencing Primer Kit. Libraries were sequenced
using the HiSeq 2500 v4 Sequencing-by-Synthesis method (paired end 76bp reads) followed by analysis with RTA v.1.12.4.2. The
minimum depth of coverage was 150X and 80X for tumor and normal samples respectively. All procedures were done at the Geno-
mics Platform of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Single cell RNA-seq data generation and processing
FASTQ ﬁles were aligned to the NCBI Human Reference Genome Build GRCh37 (hg19) using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013). Expression
levels were quantiﬁed as Transcripts Per Million (TPM) and were computed by the RSEM tool (Li and Dewey, 2011). For each cell,
we used three quality control (QC) measures. We excluded: (1) cells with a zero expression of both CD45 and CD3E; (2) cells
Cell 175, 998–1013.e1–e9, November 1, 2018
e6

expressing less than 1000 genes; (3) cells with an average expression of housekeeping genes (Table S6), log2(TPM+1) < 2.5. For
downstream analysis, we focused on protein coding genes (Table S6), out of which, we used the set of genes with expression levels
log2(TPM+1) > 4.5 in at least 10 cells per sample or genes with a particularly high expression level (log2(TPM+1) > 12) in one or more
cells, per sample.
Supervised classiﬁcation of single cells to cell types
To classify each single cell that passed QC to a pre-deﬁned cell type, we performed a supervised analysis based on a list of known
marker genes (Table S1). This was done by deﬁning a set of genes per cell type which must or must not be expressed. On average,
this approach led to the unambiguous classiﬁcation of 80% of the cells. The remaining cells were then annotated using a manual
review process. Following this step, we validated that no cell had an ambiguous classiﬁcation (e.g., a T cell and a B cells).
Dimensionality reduction
The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method (Maaten and Hinton, 2008) was used for dimensionality reduction
with the default perplexity parameter of 30 and initial dimension parameter of 10. Of note, t-SNE was used only for visualization and
not for clustering, as deﬁned below.
Unsupervised clustering of immune cells
To cluster all cells that passed QC we applied the k-means algorithm with a correlation distance metric, testing k = 3.15. The
algorithm was applied using all genes with variance > 6, yielding 4000 genes. This value was selected based on the relation between
the variance and the fraction of cells expressing each gene (Figure S8A). To determine the optimal number of clusters we applied the
following steps: (1) We ﬁrst examined how much of the complexity each cluster captures by applying the elbow method. This was
done by computing the Pearson correlation matrix R and the distance matrix D as ð1  RÞ. We then computed the sum of pairwise
distances between all cells in different clusters Disb = P
k
l = 1
 
P
i˛Cl;j;Cl
Dði; jÞ
!
and the total distance Dist = P
i;j
Dði;jÞ. The ratio between
these two measures V = Disb=Dist was used to estimate the variance explained by a given solution (Figure S8B), such that in the
extreme case where all cells are clustered together or the case where each cell is a single cluster, this ratio would be 0 and 1, respec-
tively. Exploring this ratio, we then select the solutions that are near plateau ðk = 10;.;15Þ. (2) We then performed differential expres-
sion analysis (see below) to search for gene markers that are signiﬁcantly more highly expressed in a speciﬁc cluster as compared to
all other clusters. Then, in order avoid complex solutions, we excluded solutions with clusters that have too few marker genes (< 20)
distinguishing between them and the rest of the cells. (3) Finally, we performed a robustness analysis and selected the clustering
solution with the highest median robustness score. Speciﬁcally, to determine the robustness of each clustering solution, we per-
formed 100 iterations in which we randomly removed 10% of the cells, and re-ran the k-means algorithm and checked the stability
of the clustering solution. We quantiﬁed the agreement of a given solution with the original one as the number of pairs of cells that
were either clustered together, or not clustered together, in both solutions, divided by the total number pairs shared between the
runs. This process yielded a median robustness measure of 0.96 for the selected k = 11 (Figure S8C).
To examine if there is a signiﬁcant difference between responders and non-responder lesions for a given cluster i, we computed the
fraction of cells in each lesion assigned to cluster i, and applied the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to the corresponding values of responder
and non-responder lesions. P values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure and were
considered signiﬁcant if the FDR q-value was 0.1.
Unsupervised clustering of CD8 T cells
To identify different CD8+ T cell clusters we ﬁrst extracted all single-cells classiﬁed as CD8+ in our supervised analysis. Our clustering
process for CD8+ T cells followed the exact steps described above, testing possible clustering solutions for k = 2; .; 13 (Figure S8D).
We then further explored the solutions with the highest variance explained ðk = 6;.;13Þ, and identiﬁed k = 6 as the optimal number of
clusters, with a median robustness value of 0.93 (Figure S8E). In addition, we note for k = 2; .; 6 solutions had a hierarchical pattern in
which whenever we increased k, a single cluster was split into two sub-clusters (Figures S8F and S8G). Similar to the analysis of all
cells, to examine if there is a signiﬁcant difference between responder and non-responder lesions for a given cluster i, we computed
the fraction of CD8+ cells in each lesion assigned to cluster i, and applied the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to the corresponding values of
responders and non-responder lesions. P values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) proced-
ure and were considered signiﬁcant if the FDR q-value was % 0.1.
Differential expression analysis
In all cases, differential expression analysis was applied to all genes that had an average expression level log2(TPM+1) > 2 in either
tested groups, G1 and G2. Then, for each gene i, we count the number of cells in G1 and G2 that express it with an expression level
log2(TPM+1) > 2 or % 2. We then apply Fisher’s Exact test for the corresponding 2x2 table. To identify signiﬁcant differences we
considered genes with a Bonferroni-corrected q-value % 0.05 and log2(fold-change) > 0.5.

Trajectory analysis of CD8+ T cells
To analyze the trajectory of CD8+ T cells based on single-cell RNA-seq expression data, we used Monocle v. 2.5.4 (Qiu et al., 2017).
As input to Monocle’s Reversed Graph Embedding algorithm, we selected a set of 426 genes that was the union of the top 100 differ-
entially expressed genes ordered by ascending q-value (as described above) for each of the six CD8+ T cell clusters (or all such genes
for two clusters that had fewer than 100 signiﬁcant genes).
T cell Receptor reconstruction
We applied the MixCr tool for reconstructing T cell receptors (TCRs) from all identiﬁed T cells (Bolotin et al., 2015). We deﬁned persis-
tent TCRs as TCRs having an identical CDR3 sequence in both chains and were detected in baseline (pre-therapy) and post-therapy
samples from the same patient. Enriched TCRs were deﬁned as TCRs having an identical CDR3 sequence in both chains and de-
tected in the same patient at a single time point, or in two parallel time points (e.g., multiple biopsies collected at the same time point).
Singlet TCRs found in only one T cell at one time point. Lastly, common TCRs were deﬁned as those having an identical CDR3
sequence in both chains and detected in different patients. P values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery
Rate (FDR) procedure and were considered signiﬁcant if the FDR q-value was 0.1.
ATAC-seq analysis
Sequencing reads for each sample were aligned to hg19 using Bowtie 2.2.1 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) with a max insert size of
2000 bp. SAM ﬁles were converted to BAM ﬁles and sorted using Samtools 1.3 (Li et al., 2009). Duplicate (as deﬁned by http://
broadinstitute.github.io/picard) and mitochondrial reads were removed, and peaks were called, initially by making tag directories ac-
cording to chromosome and then by ﬁnding peaks (areas with more sequencing reads than expected by chance) for each sample,
using the ‘‘DNase’’ peak ﬁnding style (‘makeTagDirectory –format sam’ and ‘ﬁndPeaks -style dnase’, Homer version 4.9) (Heinz et al.,
2010). Overlapping peaks were then merged. The number of Tn5 transposition events (50 ends of reads) lying within each peak were
quantiﬁed for each sample, yielding a matrix of peaks by samples containing ATAC read counts. EdgeR 3.14.0 was used to call
CD39+TIM3+(DP)/CD39-TIM3- (DN)-speciﬁc peaks, ﬁrst by grouping the samples by cell type (DP and DN) and pairing the samples
from each patient, and then using EdgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) to estimate the tagwise dispersion using generalized linear models
(estimateGLMTagwiseDisp function). We then performed a likelihood ratio test to identify differential accessibility between paired
samples from each patient (glmFit, glmLRT). We obtained the top differential peaks (topTags), sorting peaks by their FDR q-value.
Differential peaks between DP and DN were called signiﬁcant if their FDR q-value was 0.01. Similar analysis was performed on the
dataset (GSE89308) from the Schietinger group (Philip et al., 2017), for the identiﬁcation of unique peaks in PD-1high and central mem-
ory (CM) cells.
Motif analysis
To identify TF motifs that distinguish DP- and DN-speciﬁc peaks from non-speciﬁc (background) peaks, each peak was scanned with
the human motifs from the CIS-BP database (Weirauch et al., 2014), using the GOMER approach (Granek and Clarke, 2005), yielding
a binding score for each peak for each TF motif. The minimum hypergeometric (minHG) test was then used to gauge how well motif
scores enrich DP- or DN-speciﬁc peaks (FDR q < 0.01) compared to background peaks, considering the top N (1 up to 3000) highest
scoring peaks. Here, background peaks included those whose ATAC DP-versus-DN FDR was over 0.1 (i.e., not signiﬁcantly DP- or
DN-speciﬁc) and had an average count per million (CPM) greater than the minimum CPM of DP/DN-speciﬁc peaks (i.e., enough reads
that a difference could have been detected). MinHG P values were corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg FDR, counting each minHG test
as independent (resulting in more conservative FDR q-values).
Survival analysis
We used the TCF7+CD8+/TCF7-CD8+ ratio generated from our immunoﬂuorescence analysis to split samples into two groups
(ratio > 1 and < 1). A standard Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was then used to determine the association of these groups with survival
rate. In case where two or more samples for the same patient exist, we selected the baseline sample for this analysis.
Mutation calling pipeline
WES BAM ﬁles were aligned to the NCBI Human Reference Genome Build GRCh37 (hg19) and were checked for contamination by
DNA originating from a different individual using ContEst (Cibulskis et al., 2011). Somatic single nucleotide variations (sSNVs) were
then detected using MuTect (Cibulskis et al., 2013). Following this standard procedure, we ﬁltered sSNVs by: (1) removing potential
DNA oxidation artifacts (Costello et al., 2013); (2) realigning identiﬁed sSNVs with NovoAlign (www.novocraft.com) and performing an
additional iteration of MuTect with the newly aligned BAM ﬁles; (3) removing technology- and site-speciﬁc artifacts using a panel of
7000 TCGA normal samples (PoN ﬁltering) (Ellrott et al., 2018). Finally, sSNVs were annotated using Oncotator (Ramos et al., 2015).
Whole transcriptome analysis of bulk tumor samples
We used bulk RNA-seq data from the Van Allen et al. (Van Allen et al., 2015) (n = 37) and Riaz et al. (Riaz et al., 2017) (n = 51) datasets.
To make our comparison consistent with our single cell dataset, we aligned the RNA-seq reads with the protocol described above
Cell 175, 998–1013.e1–e9, November 1, 2018
e8

and used log2(TPM+1) values for quantiﬁcation of expression levels. To compute the bad and good signature scores we computed
the average expression of each set of marker genes (CD8_G = 34 genes, CD8_B = 1114 genes, Table S2).

In the originally published version of this article, the text associated with the vertical axis in Figure 6E mistakenly referred to the
CD39TIM3/ CD39+TIM3+ ratio, but the values correspond to the inverse ratio, i.e., CD39+TIM3+/CD39TIM3. The corrected Fig-
ure 6E is shown here, and this error has now been corrected in the article online. The authors apologize for any confusion this error
may have caused.
