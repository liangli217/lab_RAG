ABSTRACT
◥
Purpose: Sensitivity to endocrine therapy (ET) is critical for the
clinical beneﬁt from the combination of palbociclib plus ET in
hormone receptor–positive/HER2-negative (HRþ/HER2) advanced
breast cancer. Bazedoxifene is a third-generation selective estrogen
receptor (ER) modulator and selective ER degrader with activity in
preclinical models of endocrine-resistant breast cancer, including
models harboring ESR1 mutations. Clinical trials in healthy women
showed that bazedoxifene is well tolerated.
Patients and Methods: We conducted a phase Ib/II study
of bazedoxifene plus palbociclib in patients with HRþ/HER2
advanced breast cancer who progressed on prior ET (N ¼ 36;
NCT02448771).
Results: The study met its primary endpoint, with a clinical
beneﬁt rate of 33.3%, and the safety proﬁle was consistent with what
has previously been seen with palbociclib monotherapy. The medi-
an progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.6 months [95% conﬁdence
interval (CI), 2.0–7.2]. An activating PIK3CA mutation at baseline
was associated with a shorter PFS (HR ¼ 4.4; 95% CI, 1.5–13; P ¼
0.0026), but activating ESR1 mutations did not impact the PFS.
Longitudinal

whole-exome
sequencing (WES; N ¼ 68 plasma samples) provided an overview
of the tumor heterogeneity and the subclonal genetic evolution, and
identiﬁed actionable mutations acquired during treatment.
Conclusions: The combination of palbociclib and bazedoxifene
has clinical efﬁcacy and an acceptable safety proﬁle in a heavily
pretreated patient population with advanced HRþ/HER2 breast
cancer. These results merit continued investigation of bazedoxifene
in breast cancer.
Introduction
CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) with endocrine therapy (ET) are the
standard of care in hormone receptor–positive/HER2-negative (HRþ/
HER2) advanced breast cancer (1). The cyclin D1–dependent kinases
CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylate the pRB tumor suppressor, enabling
progression through the cell cycle. Cyclin D1 is a key transcriptional
target of the estrogen receptor (ER), and the convergence of the ER
transcriptional network and cyclin D1-CDK4/6-Rb1 axis contributes
to the synergistic activity of ET and CDK4/6i, such as palbociclib (2–4).
This synergy is a key component of the clinical efﬁcacy of palbociclib,
which has limited clinical beneﬁt as a single agent (5).
The importance of the synergy between ET and palbociclib suggests
that improved targeting of ER may enhance the efﬁcacy of regimens
combining ET and palbociclib. This notion is supported by recent
studies demonstrating that several mechanisms of resistance to ET are
also mechanisms of resistance to the combination of ET and palbo-
ciclib (6, 7). Importantly, in the randomized phase III PADA-1 trial,
patients with HRþ/HER2 metastatic breast cancer with an ESR1-
activating ligand-binding domain (LBD) mutation, which confers
resistance to ET, had double the odds of disease progression while
on treatment with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) plus palbociclib com-
pared with patients with wild-type (WT) ESR1 (8). Furthermore, in the
PADA-1 trial, patients with rising plasma circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) ESR1 mutations had improved progression-free survival
(PFS) when treatment was switched to fulvestrant and palbociclib
versus continued treatment with an AI and palbociclib (9). In the
PALOMA-3 trial, the Y537S ESR1 LBD mutation was enriched after
the acquisition of resistance to fulvestrant alone or to the combi-
nation of palbociclib plus fulvestrant in metastatic disease (10).
Collectively, these results suggest that better targeting of ER can
improve outcomes with the combination of a CDK4/6i and ET, and
the Y537S ESR1 mutation has a role in the acquisition of resistance
to fulvestrant and palbociclib.
Bazedoxifene is a selective ER modulator (SERM)-selective ER
degrader (SERD) hybrid (SSH; i.e., has ER degrader properties in
addition to the SERM activity; refs. 11–13). Bazedoxifene has favorable

effects on bone and lipid metabolism without adversely affecting the
uterus (14, 15). It is the only SERM that is approved in combination
with conjugated estrogens for the prevention of postmenopausal
symptoms and osteoporosis based on large randomized clinical
trials in healthy postmenopausal women (16). Preclinical studies
showed that bazedoxifene has antitumor activity in HRþ breast
cancer models, including models of resistance to tamoxifen, resis-
tance to estrogen deprivation, and models harboring a Y537S ER
LBD mutation (11, 12, 17, 18). Preclinical studies showed that
bazedoxifene had greater inhibitory effects on cell growth and ER-
mediated transcription compared with tamoxifen or fulvestrant in
the presence of the Y537S ESR1 mutations (13, 19). Computational
predictions and, more recently, the crystal structure of mutant LBD
bound to bazedoxifene showed that the Y537S-mutant LBD bound
to bazedoxifene leads to the formation of a new S537-E380 hydro-
gen bond that stabilizes helix 12 (H12) in the activating function-2
(AF-2) cleft of the LBD, and this enables the inhibition of coacti-
vator binding that results in transcriptional inhibition. In contrast,
several other SERMS and SERDs, including tamoxifen and fulves-
trant, were shown to have limited transcriptional inhibitory activity
in the presence of the Y537S mutation. This is likely because H12 is
pushed out from the AF-2 cleft of the Y537S-mutant LBD after
interacting with tamoxifen or fulvestrant, and this allows coacti-
vator binding and consequently a decreased response to these
drugs (13, 19).
Taken together, based on the preclinical data of bazedoxifene in
endocrine-resistant HRþ breast cancer models, the safety proﬁle of
bazedoxifene in randomized clinical trials, and the rationale of com-
bining palbociclib with next-generation ETs, we conducted the ﬁrst
clinical trial with the combination of palbociclib and bazedoxifene.
This was a phase Ib/II study designed to investigate the efﬁcacy and
safety of palbociclib with bazedoxifene for the treatment of patients
with HRþ/HER2 advanced breast cancer who had progressed on
prior ET. In addition, we performed serial ctDNA whole-exome
sequencing (WES) to study genetic mechanisms of resistance and the
tumor clonal architecture and evolution during treatment with pal-
bociclib and bazedoxifene.
Patients and Methods
Patient population
We enrolled female or male patients ages 18 years or older with
histologically conﬁrmed invasive breast cancer that was metastatic or
unresectable locally advanced disease. Primary or invasive disease was
conﬁrmed to be HRþ (ER >10% and/or progesterone receptor>10%)
and HER2 according the American Society of Clinical Oncology/
College of Pathology guidelines (20) [deﬁned as 0–1þ by IHC or FISH-
negative (HER2 copy number < 6 and HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0)].
Measurable disease was required per RECIST 1.1 (21). Bone-only
disease was allowed if there was evidence of lytic lesions (22). Pro-
gressive disease on prior ET was required; this was deﬁned as relapse
while on adjuvant ET or within 1 year of completion of adjuvant ET, or
progression through at least one line of ET in metastatic or locally
advanced breast cancer. Postmenopausal and premenopausal women
who have been on a GnRH agonist were eligible. Prior treatment with
up to two lines of chemotherapy in advanced disease was allowed. The
protocol was amended to allow up to one line of prior chemotherapy
when the 18th patient was enrolled. There was no limit to the number
of prior endocrine therapies.
Study design and treatment
The study was a phase IB/II, single-arm, single-institution, and
open-label study. The objectives were to evaluate the safety and
antitumor activity of the combination of palbociclib and bazedoxifene.
The primary endpoint was clinical beneﬁt rate (CBR), deﬁned as the
proportion of patients with complete response (CR), partial response
(PR), or stable disease (SD) at week 24 [per RECIST version 1.1 (21)]. A
CBR of 20% or less would not be of clinical interest based on a
conservative estimate of the percentage of patients who progressed on
adjuvant ET or progressed on ET or palbociclib as a single agent in
metastatic disease (5). Secondary endpoints included objective
response rate, PFS, overall survival (OS), and safety. Objectives were
determined in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and the evalu-
able cohort who reached the ﬁrst restaging timepoint.
All patients received bazedoxifene 40 mg orally once daily on days
1–28 and palbociclib 125 mg orally once daily on days 1–21 of a 28-day
cycle. The bazedoxifene dose of 40 mg was based on published safety
data for this dose (23). The ﬁrst 6 patients enrolled completed a safety
run-in, and accrual was paused for safety assessment after these
patients completed at least one treatment cycle. Response and pro-
gression were evaluated using RECIST 1.1 guidelines (21). For patients
with bone-only disease, evaluation was done per MD Anderson bone
tumor response criteria (22). After a baseline scan, tumor response was
assessed every 8 weeks, with a PR or CR requiring conﬁrmation within
4–6 weeks. After cycle 6, tumor measurements were performed every
12 weeks. Safety was evaluated according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0.
Exploratory translational objectives were to investigate the efﬁcacy of
the combination of bazedoxifene and palbociclib in relation to geno-
mic ﬁndings in ctDNA.
Statistical analyses
The study followed a Simon “optimal” two-stage design. On the
basis of the published activity of palbociclib as a single agent, a CBR of
20% or less was considered not to be of clinical interest and was the null
hypothesis, and a CBR of ≥30% was considered worthy of further
investigation. The sample size of 37 patients was chosen to have 90%
power to declare the combination effective at this rate while controlling
for no more than 10% one-sided type I error under the null hypothesis.
The ﬁrst stage of the study included 17 evaluable patients, and accrual
was continued to the second stage after the conﬁrmation that at least 4
patients met the primary endpoint.
CBR was reported as a proportion and 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)
accounting for the two-stage design. Associations between CBR and
clinical and/or correlative factors were assessed using the Wilcoxon
test for continuous variables and Fisher exact test for categorical
variables.
Median PFS in months was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier
estimation method and compared between clinical and/or correlative
factors via log-rank test. HRs were obtained using Cox proportional
Translational Relevance
In this clinical trial, we show that bazedoxifene plus palbociclib
has clinical efﬁcacy in patients with advanced hormone receptor–
positive breast cancer and this combination is well tolerated.
Pathogenic PIK3CA mutations are a candidate biomarker of
resistance to bazedoxifene plus palbociclib. In addition, we dem-
onstrate the utility of circulating tumor DNA whole-exome
sequencing and the signiﬁcance of determining the subclonal
evolution in individual patients.

hazards models. All tests were two sided with a type I error of 0.05. All
analyses were carried out via SAS, V9.4 (SAS Institute) and R, V4.0.2.
Sample collection and processing
Whole venous blood (6–10 mL) was collected from patients
into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid vacutainer tubes (Becton and
Dickinson). Blood was processed within 2 hours of collection. Whole
blood was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1,200  g and the plasma
supernatant was cleared by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3,000  g.
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA was extracted from 2 to 7 mL of plasma
and eluted into 40–80 mL of resuspension buffer using the Qiagen
Circulating DNA kit on the QIAsymphony liquid handling system.
Germline DNA (gDNA) was extracted using the Qiasymphony DSP
DNA midi kit on the QIAsymphony liquid handling system. Quan-
tiﬁcation of extracted cfDNA and gDNA was performed using the
PicoGreen (Life Technologies) assay on a Hamilton STAR-line liquid
handling system. Library preparation was performed using a com-
mercially available kit (KAPA HyperPrep Kit with Library Ampliﬁ-
cation product KK8504) and IDT’s duplex UMI adapters. Unique
8-base dual index sequences embedded within the p5 and p7 primers
(purchased from IDT) were added during PCR. Enzymatic clean-up
was performed using Beckman Coultier AMPure XP beads. Samples
were sequenced using Illumina sequencing technology.
ctDNA analysis
Sequenced reads in both ultra-low passage whole-genome sequenc-
ing (ULP-WGS) and WES libraries were mapped to the human
reference genome (hg19) with BWA-MEM (version 0.17.7; RRID:
SCR_010910). PCR duplicates were ﬂagged by MarkDuplicates in
Picard tool (version 2.26.10; RRID: SCR_006525). ichorCNA (version
0.1; ref. 24) was run for estimating tumor purity estimation. We
applied the hg19 panel of normals provided in the ichorCNA github
repo (inst/extdata/HD_ULP_PoN_1Mb_median _normAutosome_-
mapScoreFiltered_median.rds).
SNV/indel detection
Somatic mutations on the exome data were called by The Cancer
Genome Analysis (TCGA) WES Characterization Pipeline (the CGA
pipeline). The CGA pipeline ﬁrst runs deTiN (25) and ContEst (ref. 26;
RRID: SCR_000595) for estimating potential tumor-in-normal con-
tamination and cross-patient contamination, and calls single-
nucleotide variants (SNV) and indels with MuTect (ref. 27; RRID:
SCR_000559) and Strelka (ref. 28; RRID: SCR_005109), respectively.
Out of the 68 exome samples, two samples were processed as tumor-
only due to lack of the matched normals. For the tumor-only runs,
CalculateContamination
in
GATK4
(version
4.0.5.1;
RRID:
SCR_001876) was used for estimating the cross-patient contamina-
tion. For the indel calling step in the tumor-only runs, an unmatched
normal sample was used for Strelka, which requires a matched normal
input. Potential artifacts were ﬁltered with two panels of normals
(created from 298 normal samples and 8,334 TCGA normal samples,
respectively), the BLAT (RRID: SCR_011919) read-realignment ﬁlter,
and the read orientation bias ﬁlters. The mutations in the tumor-only
runs were further ﬁltered if the called mutations overlapped with the
germline mutations with the population allele frequencies ≥5% in the
gnomAD database (ref. 29; RRID: SCR_014964). Mutations were
denoted as pathogenic or likely pathogenic based on OncoKB (ref. 30;
RRID: SCR_014782).
Mutational signatures were extracted using two algorithms: (i)
hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP; https://github.com/nicolaro
berts/hdp) based on the Bayesian hierarchical Dirichlet process, and
(ii) SignatureAnalyzer based on Bayesian non-negative matrix factor-
ization (31). The Gibbs sampler was run with 20,000 burn-in iterations
(parameter “burnin”). With a spacing of 200 iterations (parameter
“space”), 100 iterations were collected (parameter “n”). After each
Gibbs sampling iteration, three iterations of concentration parameter
sampling were performed (parameter “cpiter”). To deconvolute com-
posite signatures and to equate obtained HDP signatures to reference
signatures, we used an expectation-maximization algorithm to decon-
struct these signatures into reference constituents (31). Because of the
low burden of indels, we excluded a mismatch repair deﬁciency
signature (SBS6) and homologous repair deﬁciency signature (SBS3)
from the candidate list using SigFit (32).
Copy-number alterations in the WES samples were detected
by GATK-CNV (version 4.1.2.0; RRID: SCR_001876) with -num-
ber-of-changepoints-penalty-factor ¼ 2.0. As the postﬁltering steps, a
panel of normals created from 298 normal samples was used,
and potential germline copy-number alterations were discarded. The
allelic copy-number alteration outputs from ModelSegments in
GATK-CNV (version 4.1.2.0) were used for estimating tumor purity
with ABSOLUTE (ref. 33; RRID: SCR_005198). The estimated tumor
purity between the exomes (ABSOLUTE) and the ULP-WGS data
(ichorCNA) was highly correlated (Pearson correlation coefﬁcient ¼
0.98). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was calculated as the number of
coding mutations per Mb of covered exons.
The genomic sites of detected mutations across serial WES in a
patient were force-called by investigating the number of reference and
alternate bases at the sites. Somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA)
in the serial WES were also grouped across the timepoints. Phylo-
gicNDT was run with 500 iterations of Markov chain Monte Carlo
Gibbs sampler on the force-called mutations and SCNAs to assign
mutations to clonal clusters for estimating the phylogeny (34).
Compliance with ethical standards
The study was conducted in accordance with the International
Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Standards and
the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional review board approval was
obtained at Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC). The
study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02448771). The DF/
HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, which is composed of
clinical specialists with experience in oncology and who had no direct
relationship with the study, reviewed and monitored toxicity and
accrual data from the study. Participants provided written informed
consent prior to the performance of any protocol speciﬁc procedures
or assessments. The study was an investigator-initiated trial funded by
Pﬁzer. Palbociclib and bazedoxifene were supplied by the manufac-
turer (Pﬁzer). The funder had no role in data collection, data analysis,
or data interpretation.
Data and materials availability
TCGA pan-cancer data are available through a data portal
(https://gdc.cancer.gov/node/905/; https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/
publications/pancanatlas). The WES data from this study was depos-
ited in dbGap accession number phs002802.v1.p1.

Between July 2015 and July 2017, we enrolled 36 patients with
advanced HRþ/HER2 breast cancer (34 females and 2 males; Sup-

includes the study representative information). All patients had ERþ,
HER2 disease. The median age was 59.5 years (range, 37–79 years).
Most of the patients had liver metastases (64%, 23/36) and 33% of
patients (12/36) had lung metastases. Only 6% of patients (2/36) had
bone-only disease. All patients had disease progression while on ET or
disease recurrence within 1 year of completion of adjuvant ET. Most
patients were heavily pretreated, with 50% of patients (18/36) having
received two or more prior lines of ET and 52% of patients (19/36)
having received up to two lines of chemotherapy in advanced disease.
Nearly all patients (28/36) had disease progression while on treatment
with an AI or disease recurrence within 1 year of completion of
adjuvant treatment with an AI. There were 7 (19%) patients who
received prior treatment with fulvestrant and 4 (11%) patients who
received prior treatment with everolimus.
Treatment administration and safety
At the data cutoff in August 2020, with a median follow-up of
29.6 months, all patients had discontinued palbociclib and bazedox-
ifene treatment. A median of 4 cycles were given per patient (range, 1–
34). The ﬁrst 6 patients who were included in the safety run-in did not
experience any dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during their ﬁrst treat-
ment cycle. Thus, all patients were given 125 mg palbociclib for the
remainder of the study. Neutropenia (61%) and fatigue (22%) were the
most common adverse events associated with study treatment. A total
of 16 patients (44%) experienced grade 3 neutropenia, and 1 patient
(3%) experienced grade 4 neutropenia (Table 2; Supplementary
Table S2). There were no deaths attributed to the study treatment.
Most patients discontinued treatment due to disease progression
(83%). Only 1 patient (3%) discontinued treatment due to proto-
col-speciﬁed unacceptable toxicity (neutropenia). Palbociclib dose
reductions were required in 14 (38.9%) patients due to toxicity. Doses
were held in 23 (63.9%) patients for a median of 10 days (range, 1–
45 days). There were no bazedoxifene dose reductions, and bazedox-
ifene doses were held in 13 (36.1%) patients for a median of 12 days
(range, 5–22 days; Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).
Efﬁcacy
Of the 36 patients, 1 patient was unevaluable (this patient developed
grade 4 neutropenia during the ﬁrst cycle) and was included in the ITT
analysis (Table 3). In the ﬁrst stage of the study, 17 evaluable patients

were enrolled; 5 of these patients achieved a clinical beneﬁt (SD ≥
24 weeks). The study continued to the second stage and accrued 19
additional patients. Accounting for the two-stage design, the best
overall response in the ITT analysis was SD in 20 patients (20/36,
55.6%), progressive disease in 14 patients (14/36, 38.9%) and a
conﬁrmed PR in 1 patient. Among the patients with SD, 3 patients
had unconﬁrmed PR (Fig. 1A). The CBR at ≥24 weeks was 33.3% (12/
36; 95% CI, 9.8–56.4) accounting for two-stage design. This exceeded
the predetermined boundary of at least 11 patients experiencing
clinical beneﬁt and therefore met the primary endpoint. These includ-
ed 1 patient with a conﬁrmed PR and 11 patients with SD ≥24 weeks.
When including only evaluable patients, the CBR at ≥24 weeks was
34.3% (12/35; 95% CI, 20.7–58.9) accounting for two-stage design. Of
the patients who achieved a clinical beneﬁt at ≥24 weeks, 4 patients (4/
36, 11.1%) had an exceptional clinical beneﬁt with disease stability for
≥12 months (Fig. 1A and B; Table 3). The median PFS was 3.6 months
(95% CI, 2.0–7.2; Fig. 1C), and the median OS was 26.5 months (95%
CI, 20.7–notreached; Fig. 1D). Therewas no association between prior
treatment regimens in the metastatic setting and the clinical beneﬁt,
including; prior tamoxifen treatment [prior tamoxifen, 30.8% (8/26)
vs. no prior tamoxifen, 40% (4/10); P ¼ 0.7, Fisher exact test for all
comparisons in this section], prior fulvestrant [prior fulvestrant, 28.6%
(2/7) vs. no prior fulvestrant, 34.5% (10/29); P ¼ 0.8], or prior
chemotherapy treatment [prior chemotherapy, 36.8% (7/19) vs. no
prior chemotherapy, 29.4% (5/17); P ¼ 0.7]. There was also no
association between the number of prior treatment regimens in the
metastatic setting and clinical beneﬁt [0–1 lines of treatment, 33.3% (3/
9) vs. ≥2 lines of treatment, 33.3% (9/27); P ¼ 1.0]. However, liver
metastases versus no liver metastases [17.4% (4/23) vs. 61.5% (8/13),
respectively], or three to four organs with metastatic involvement
versus two organs versus one organ with metastatic involvement
[14.2% (3/21) vs. 60% (6/10) vs. 60% (3/5), respectively] were asso-
ciated with decreased clinical beneﬁt (P ¼ 0.01).
Cell-free DNA tumor fraction dynamics
Plasma samples were collected at baseline (n ¼ 36), day 1 of cycle 2
(C2D1; n ¼ 33) and at the time of disease progression at the end of
treatment (EOT; n ¼ 33) to identify genetic alterations associated with
primary or acquired resistance to bazedoxifene and palbociclib (Sup-
plementary Fig. S2A and S2B). All samples (n ¼ 102) were subjected to
ULP-WGS (mean coverage 0.19–0.57X) to determine cell-free DNA
(cfDNA) tumor fraction (TF; see Patients and Methods) for the
selection of samples with detectable ctDNA for subsequent WES, and
to determine the relationship between the TF and clinical outcomes
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). The median tumor fraction in all samples
was 0.04 [range (0–0.85)]. Baseline cfDNA TF was higher in patients
with liver metastases [median ¼ 0.07 (0–0.85)] versus patients without
liver metastases [median ¼ 0.04 (0–0.3)] (Wilcoxon P ¼ 0.01; Sup-
plementary Fig. S3B) and patients who had three to four organs
involved with metastases [median ¼ 0.06 (0–0.85)] versus one
organ involved with metastases [median ¼ 0.03 (0–0.04)] (Wilcoxon
P ¼ 0.03). Moreover, baseline cfDNA TF correlated with PFS; patients
with a high baseline cfDNA TF (≥0.1) had a lower PFS (n ¼ 12, median
PFS ¼ 1.94 months) compared with patients with a low cfDNA TF
(<0.1; n ¼ 24, median PFS ¼ 5.56 months; HR ¼ 2.29; 95% CI, 1.08–
4.89; P ¼ 0.027, log-rank test; Supplementary Fig. S3C). There was no
signiﬁcant association between the changes incfDNA TF after 1 month
of treatment and PFS [ratio between C2D1/baseline TF > 1 (n ¼ 12),
median PFS ¼ 2.04 months; vs. C2D1/baseline TF ≤1 (n ¼ 19), median
PFS ¼ 3.67 months, HR ¼ 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4–1.9; P ¼ 0.71] (Supple-
mentary Fig. S3D). Comparison of the TF at C2D1 and the EOT
showed an increase in TF in most cases (58%, 18/31). The TF was
unchanged in 7 patients (23%) and in 6 patients (19%) there was a
decrease at the EOT. In most of the cases in which the TF decreased at
the EOT, the absolute change was marginal and the TF either remained
low (in the range of 0.03) or very high (above 0.45) except for one
patient (patient 25) who had a decrease in the TF from 0.6 at C2D1 to
0.045 at the EOT. This patient had an increase in the size of the liver
metastases but a mixed response of bone metastases with evidence of
decreased ﬂuorodeoxyglucose uptake in several bone metastases based
on a PET-CT scan. Thus, although the early cfDNA TF dynamics were
not indicative of PFS, the cfDNA TF was overall reﬂective of metastatic
burden and in most cases of disease progression.
Genomic alterations and clinical beneﬁt
Samples with detectable ctDNA (cfDNA TF > 0.03) were subjected
to WES (mean target coverage ¼ 90–461X, median ¼ 193X). WES was
performed in 68 samples [baseline 28/36 (78%), C2D1 19/34 (56%)
and EOT 23/32 (78%)] (Mutation Annotation Format in Supplemen-
tary table S5). These included 20 matched pairs of baseline and EOT
samples. Sample-to-sample correlation of the somatic SNVs (SSNV) in
the 68 samples showed that the matched samples from an individual
patient had the strongest correlation in nearly all cases except for two
samples that had a low number of mutations (Supplementary
Fig. S4A). As expected, most of the SSNVs in exonic regions were
unique to a single patient (4,205 of 4,227 nonsilent SSNVs, 99.5%;
3,190 of 3,211 silent SSNVs, 99.3%). The most frequent SSNVs were
oncogenic hotspot mutations in ESR1 and PIK3CA (Supplementary
Fig. S4B).
We next focused on known cancer-related genes (list of genes and
the detected amino acid changes in Supplementary Table S6). At
baseline, the most frequent mutations in the cancer-related genes
included pathogenic or likely-pathogenic mutations in ESR1 (Fig. 2B),
pathogenic PIK3CA mutations (Fig. 2D), EPAS1 (none of these are
known to be pathogenic) and TP53 mutations (Supplementary
Table S6). Other baseline pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations
identiﬁed in at least 2 patients included AKT1 and KMT2C mutations
(Figs. 2A–C; Supplementary Table S6). Pathogenic ESR1 mutations
were found in 32% (9/28) of baseline samples, with the missense
mutations Y537 and D538 accounting for the majority of the ESR1
mutations (Fig. 2B). ESR1 mutations were detected in patients who
had or did not have a clinical beneﬁt at ≥24 weeks (Fig. 2A), and there
was no association between the ESR1 mutations and PFS [WT median
PFS ¼ 3.6 months (n ¼ 19), mutant median PFS ¼ 2.0 months (n ¼ 9);
HR ¼ 1.0; 95% CI, 0.4–2.4; P ¼ 0.94, log-rank test for all comparisons
in this section] (Fig. 2D). In contrast, baseline hotspot PIK3CA
mutations were not detected in patients who had a clinical beneﬁt at
≥24 weeks (Fig. 2A), and patients with a baseline PIK3CA mutation
had a lower PFS compared with patients with WT PIK3CA at baseline
[WT median PFS ¼ 3.9 months (n ¼ 22), mutant median PFS ¼
1.8 months (n ¼ 6); HR ¼ 0.2; 95% CI, 0.06–0.6, P ¼ 0.0019] (Fig. 2E).
This difference remained signiﬁcant in a multivariate analysis correct-
ing for signiﬁcant clinical variables including the presence of liver
metastases versus no liver metastases and 1 versus three to four organs
with metastases (mutant vs. WT HR ¼ 3.82; 95% CI, 1.18–12.33; P ¼
0.025; Supplementary Table S7). In addition, patients who had a
baseline truncating mutation, including mostly pathogenic or likely
pathogenic mutations in tumor suppressor genes (TP53, MEN1, RB1,
CDKN1B, NF1, TP53, BP1, TP63, SMAD2, SMAD4, ARID1A, and
KMT2C), had a worse PFS in a univariate analysis [no truncating
mutation PFS ¼ 3.8 months (n ¼ 21), truncating mutation median PFS
¼ 1.7 months (n ¼ 7), HR ¼ 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.7; P ¼ 0.006] and in a

multivariate analysis (mutant vs. WT HR ¼ 3.01; 95% CI, 1.09–8.3; P ¼
0.034; Fig. 2F; Supplementary Table S7).
Consistent with the baseline ctDNA, the most common SSNVs in
cancer-related genes at the EOT were PIK3CA (32%, 7/22) and ESR1
(27%, 6/22), followed by PTEN, TP53, and GATA3 (Fig. 2G). Com-
parison of the matched baseline and EOT ctDNA pairs showed a high
correlation between the frequency of the mutations found in at least
two different patients (r ¼ 0.7, P ¼ 0.01, Pearson correlation; Fig. 2H).
However, when comparing EOT ctDNA versus baseline ctDNA in
individual patients, several patients gained actionable driver mutations
at the EOT that are suggestive of putative mechanisms of acquired
resistance and offer potential therapeutic targets. As examples, one
patient (patient 30) who was on treatment for 7 months gained two
BRAF missense mutations (G469A and D287H) and 2 hotspot
PIK3CA mutations (E365K and N1044K). A second patient (patient
10) was on treatment for 3 months and gained pathogenic mutations in
ERBB2 (S310Y) and PIK3CA (H1047L), and a missense mutation in
FGFR2 (L309V; Supplementary Fig. S5).
SCNA analysis was performed in 30 plasma ctDNA samples from 16
patients with a TF ≥0.15 (baseline n ¼ 12, C2D1 n ¼ 9, EOT n ¼
9; Fig. 3A). Two patients (patient 1 and patient 14) were found to have
genome doubling, which is associated with poor outcomes (35). In all
samples, there were SCNAs in at least two cancer-related driver genes.
In addition, in all samples we identiﬁed SCNAs in at least one gene
related to a potential mechanism of resistance to ET and/or CDK4/6i.
These included SCNAs in CCND1, CCNE2, MYC, ESR1, CDKN2B,
CDKN2A, FOXA1, PIK3CA, AURKA, AURKB, CDKN1A, FGFR1,
CDK6, CDK4, IGF1R, or PTEN (7, 36–38). Ampliﬁcations or gains
in CCND1 and other genes that are within the same genomic region on
11q13.3 (FGF19, FGF3, and FGF4) were among the most common
SCNAs. In addition, ELF3 ampliﬁcations or gains were identiﬁed in
most of the patients (69%, 11/16). In line with the high frequency of
ELF3 SCNAs that we identiﬁed, ampliﬁcations of ELF3 are more
frequent in ERþ/HER2 metastatic breast cancers in the Metastatic
Breast Cancer Project (39, 40) versus the ERþ/HER2 primary breast
cancers in TCGA cohort (ref. 41; 31%, 22/70 in metastatic tumors vs.
6%, 29/471 in primary tumors, P < 0.0001, Fisher exact test). Overall,
ampliﬁcations and losses at baseline or C2D1 compared with EOT
within the matched pairs were comparable. Only a small number
SCNA were acquired at the EOT. As an example, one patient (Patient
4) acquired losses of CDKN2A and CDKN2B (genes that encode the
cell-cycle inhibitors P16 and P15,respectively, and are both in the same
region in 9p).
We next assessed additional genomic features, including TMB
(42, 43) and mutational signatures (44, 45) in the 30 ctDNA WES
with sufﬁcient TF. These features are associated with breast cancer
outcomes and could potentially predict sensitivity or resistance to
bazedoxifene plus palbociclib. The median TMBs at baseline (n ¼ 12)
and EOT (n ¼ 9) were comparable and low [baseline median of 1.3
mutations/Mb, range (0.74–19.5); EOT median of 0.87 mutations/Mb,
range (0.73–12.0); Wilcoxon P ¼ 0.84] (Fig. 3B) and there was no
signiﬁcant difference in the TMB in patients who had a clinical
beneﬁt compared with patients who did not across all timepoints
(Wilcoxon P ¼ 0.7).
As for the mutational signatures in the cohort (Fig. 3C), the most
common mutational signatures (SBS1, SBS5, and SBS40) can be
attributed to clock-like and aging processes. The patients with a high
TMB (Patient 2, 10, and 30) had enriched APOBEC signatures (SBS2
and SBS13). The same set of APOBEC signatures was detected in
patients 21 and 31. Overall, most of the patients with APOBEC
signatures (4 of 5 patients) did not have a clinical beneﬁt from
bazedoxifene and palbociclib. Albeit a small number of patients, these
results are consistent with previous studies showing that the APOBEC
signature is associated with endocrine resistance (44) and a high
TMB (46). We also detected the mutational signature (SBS17b) that
is associated with exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, 5-ﬂuorouracil
and capecitabine in a patient who received treatment with capecitabine
followed by eribulin prior to enrollment on the study.
Clonal architecture and subclonal evolution during treatment
To better understand how tumor heterogeneity and the subclonal
evolution contribute to treatment resistance, we performed an evo-
lutionary analysis (see Patients and Methods). Seven patients had
sufﬁcient ctDNA (cfDNA TF ≥0.15) from three timepoints or at
baseline and EOT (Fig. 4A–D; Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6C). In at
least 3 of these patients the clonal evolution helped to shed light on
potential mechanisms of treatment resistance. Patients 17 (Fig. 4A)
and 2 (Fig. 4B) had clonal PIK3CA and ESR1 pathogenic mutations.
Patient 17 had a subclone with losses of the tumor suppressor genes,
RB1 and PBRM1, and the abundance of this subclone increased at the
time of disease progression [cancer cell fraction (CCF) of 0.10 at
baseline increased to 0.52 at EOT]. Patient 2 had two major subclone
branches (light blue and red in Fig. 4B). Interestingly, within less than
2 months at the time of disease progression, the subclone with an ESR1
D538G and an NF1 truncal mutation increased from a CCF of 0.37 at
baseline to 1. Loss of neuroﬁbromin was shown to be a mechanism of
treatment resistance in HRþ breast cancer (47). On the other hand, the
second subclone with a SMAD2-truncating mutation and VHL mis-
sense mutation decreased from a CCF of 0.45 at baseline to 0.02 at EOT
and is likely not a key driver of the disease progression.
Patient 1 had rapid disease progression within less than a month and
was found to have a clonal pathogenic RB1 mutation (E54) at baseline
and at EOT (Fig. 4C). Although this RB1 mutation is monoallelic, it
has been shown that the loss of even one copy of Rb1 can lead to
genomic instability (48). Patient 1 and patient 5 had clonal ZFHX3
(zinc ﬁnger homeobox 3) mutations (Fig. 4C and D). In addition, three
other patients in our study had nonsilent ZFHX3 mutations (clonal
status could not be evaluated in these other patients), making ZFHX3 a
common mutation in our dataset [16% (5/31)]. In contrast, ZFHX3
mutations, mainly deletions and truncating mutations, were found in
only 4% of the ERþ breast cancers in TCGA cohort (39–41).
Discussion
We provide the ﬁrst study report of the clinical efﬁcacy and
safety of bazedoxifene in combination with palbociclib for the treat-
ment of endocrine-resistant HRþ/HER2 advanced breast cancer. We
observed SD as the best response in 56% of the ITT patient population
and 57% in the evaluable patient population. The CBR ≥24 weeks was
33% and 34% in the ITT and the evaluable patients, respectively, in a
heavily pretreated patient population. The CBR at 24 weeks exceeded
the predeﬁned threshold, meeting the primary endpoint of the study.
In this study, >50% of the patients had prior chemotherapy in the
metastatic setting, and >40% of the patients had at least two prior lines
of ET. Prior chemotherapy is associated with decreased beneﬁt from
subsequent treatments (49, 50). In addition, most of the patients had
liver metastases, which is also associated with worse outcomes in HRþ
advanced breast cancer (51). Importantly, the results of this study
compare favorably to a phase II study of palbociclib as monotherapy in
patients with HRþ advanced breast cancer, in which the CBR ≥
24 weeks was 21% (7/33; ref. 5), providing evidence for the clinical
efﬁcacy of bazedoxifene in this setting.

The need for new ETs when combined with a CDK4/6i that better
target the ER mutations in advanced breast cancer is supported by the
recent results from the PADA-1 clinical trial. In PADA-1, switching
from an AI plus palbociclib to fulvestrant plus palbociclib in patients
with HRþ advanced breast cancer and rising levels of ctDNA ESR1
mutations, resulted in improved PFS (9). In retrospective analyses, the
presence of an ESR1 mutation did not lead to inferior outcomes with
the combination of fulvestrant and a CDK4/6i (52). However, pre-
clinical studies (53) and clinical studies (54, 55) showed decreased
activity of single-agent fulvestrant in the presence of the ESR1

Bazedoxifene and Palbociclib in Advanced Breast Cancer

mutations, particularly the Y537S ER mutation. On the other hand,
preclinical studies showed that bazedoxifene has superior activity in
inhibiting the Y537S ER mutation compared with fulvestrant and
biophysical and structural studies provided mechanistic insights
explaining these differences (13, 18). In line with these preclinical
studies, our clinical trial showed that the presence of an ESR1 mutation
was not associated with decreased beneﬁt from the combination of
bazedoxifene and palbociclib. Taken together, these published clinical
and preclinical studies, along with the results from our clinical trial
support a future randomized clinical trial comparing the combination
bazedoxifene plus a CDK4/6i versus fulvestrant plus a CDK4/6i in
patients with advanced breast cancer who have rising levels of ctDNA
ESR1 mutations.
The EMERALD trial was a randomized phase III study investigating
the new a SSH, elacetsrant, versus standard-of-care ET (AI or fulves-
trant; ref. 56). In this trial, patients with HRþ advanced breast cancer
who progressed on prior treatment with ET and a CDK4/6i and were
randomized to receive elacestrant had improved PFS compared with
patients that received standard-of-care ET. The magnitude of this
improvement was higher in patients that had an ESR1 mutation. These
results provided evidence for improved clinical outcomes with a single-
agent next-generation ET, particularly in patients that have disease
that remains ER dependent and support further development of this
class of drugs. However, the median PFS was limited in the EMERALD
trial and future studies will need to identify the patients who continue
to beneﬁt from ET after treatment with CDK4/6i and investigate novel
treatment combination that incorporate the next-generation ETs.
Increasing the dose of ET is another potential strategy to improve
efﬁcacy from ET, especially in the presence of the Y537S ER mutation,
which is characterized by decreased afﬁnity to multiple SERMs and
SERDS (19, 57). Because bazedoxifene was well tolerated in large
clinical trials with healthy women and in our study in advanced breast
cancer, there were no signiﬁcant gastrointestinal or other DLTs, a trial
to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efﬁcacy of higher doses
of bazedoxifene in patients with HRþ advanced breast cancer and an
ESR1 mutation is warranted.
We performed a prospective analysis of serial ctDNA WES to
search for genetic determinants of sensitivity and resistance to the
combination of bazedoxifene and palbociclib in advanced breast
cancer after multiple lines of treatment. We showed that pathogenic
PIK3CA mutations were associated with decreased PFS. Preclinical
studies support the role of the PI3-kinase pathway in endocrine
resistance (58, 59), and the a-speciﬁc PI3-kinase inhibitor alpelisib
in combination with fulvestrant is approved for the treatment of
PIK3CA-mutant HRþ metastatic breast cancer (60). A preclinical
study showed that inhibition of PI3 kinase can prevent adaptive
resistance to palbociclib, suggesting that the activation of the PI3-
kinase pathway is involved in resistance to palbociclib (61). In the
phase III PALOMA-III trial in which patients were randomized to
fulvestrant plus palbociclib or fulvestrant plus placebo, there was an
enrichment of plasma ctDNA PIK3CA mutations at the EOT. How-
ever, baseline plasma ctDNA PIK3CA mutations were not predictive of
decreased PFS (10, 62). Our results suggest that in HRþ advanced
breast cancer, the pathogenicity of the PIK3CA mutations increases in
more advanced metastatic disease after multiple lines of treatment.
This is in keeping with previous studies that showed that in metastatic
disease, the presence of a PIK3CA mutation is associated with treat-
ment resistance and tumor progression (63), whereas in early-stage,
treatment-na€ve HRþ breast cancer, PIK3CA mutations are associated
with improved outcomes (64, 65).
The ctDNA WES analyses also identiﬁed genetic alterations that are
potential novel drivers of disease progression and treatment resistance.
As an example, we identiﬁed a high rate of ELF3 SCNAs. ELF3 is a
member of the ETS transcription factors and is located within 1q32, a
region commonly gained in breast cancer. In preclinical studies, ELF3
was shown to be a transcriptional repressor of ER, suggesting a possible
role in endocrine resistance (66). We also identiﬁed a relatively high
rate of ZFHX3 mutations. ZFHX3 encodes the transcription factor
AT-motif binding factor-1 (ATBF1), which has key roles in pro-
tein–protein interactions and is a tumor suppressor in prostate
cancer (67). In HRþ breast cancer, ATBF1 inhibits ER-mediated
transcription (68), implying that aberrations in this gene may have a
role in resistance to ET.
We acknowledge several limitations in our study, including the
small number of patients that limits our ability to make strong
conclusions about the efﬁcacy of the combination of bazedoxfene and
palbociclib, and the determinants of sensitivity or resistance. In
addition, not all the plasma samples had sufﬁcient ctDNA TF for
TMB, SCNV, mutational signature, and phylogenetic analyses. None-
theless, herein we demonstrate the utility and breadth of data that can
be gleaned from WES of ctDNA. In summary, our results showed: (i)
the safety of bazedoxifene in combination with palbociclib; (ii) a signal
of the efﬁcacy of bazedoxifene in HRþ breast cancer; (iii) PIK3CA
mutations are a candidate biomarker of resistance to this combination
that can be applicable to other next-generation ETs; and (iv) the
advantages of WES of ctDNA that enabled us to capture the tumor
heterogeneity and subclonal evolution during disease progression.
WES also allowed us to identify potential novel genomic mechanisms
of tumor progression that warrant future investigation.
