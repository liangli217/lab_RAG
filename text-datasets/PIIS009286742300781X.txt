SUMMARY
Post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs) play key roles in regulating cell signaling and physiology in both
normal and cancer cells. Advances in mass spectrometry enable high-throughput, accurate, and sensitive
measurement of PTM levels to better understand their role, prevalence, and crosstalk. Here, we analyze
the largest collection of proteogenomics data from 1,110 patients with PTM proﬁles across 11 cancer types
(10 from the National Cancer Institute’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium [CPTAC]). Our study
reveals pan-cancer patterns of changes in protein acetylation and phosphorylation involved in hallmark can-
cer processes. These patterns revealed subsets of tumors, from different cancer types, including those with
dysregulated DNA repair driven by phosphorylation, altered metabolic regulation associated with immune
response driven by acetylation, affected kinase speciﬁcity by crosstalk between acetylation and phosphor-
ylation, and modiﬁed histone regulation. Overall, this resource highlights the rich biology governed by PTMs
and exposes potential new therapeutic avenues.

Concerted efforts by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis
Consortium (CPTAC) have generated large proteogenomic data-
sets for individual cancer types.4–13 These studies all included
PTMs and started to bridge the gap between molecular features
and phenotypic consequences, identifying new cancer subtypes
with potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.14 Despite these ad-
vances and the critical role PTMs play in regulation and ﬁne-tun-
ing of cellular signaling,15 their shared patterns, crosstalk among
PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation, etc.), and how multiple
PTMs form regulatory networks remain poorly understood,
especially across cancer types.
Previous pan-cancer genomic studies have demonstrated
that investigating recurrent gene and pathway alterations across
different cancer types can promote our understanding of the
fundamental molecular events that drive cancer.16,17 Here, we
set out to identify shared and divergent PTM patterns across
cancer types to investigate common post-translational regulato-
ry mechanisms that are altered in multiple cancers to both
expand and complement genomic studies. To this end, we
generated a harmonized pan-cancer cohort using data from 11
studies, encompassing samples from 1,110 treatment-naive pa-
tients, with complete genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and
PTM (phosphorylation and acetylation) data (Figure 1A). This
enabled us to search for patterns that could not be identiﬁed in
a single cohort due to the limited sample size of individual
studies (39–140 patients). To focus on shared and tissue-inde-
pendent patterns across cancer, we regressed the tissue-spe-
ciﬁc effects in each data type as part of the harmonization
process (STAR Methods).
We focused our analyses on (1) hallmark pathways known to
be dysregulated in cancer18 that are tightly controlled by
PTMs,19,20
including
DNA
damage
and
repair
pathways,
cell immuno-metabolism, and histone-level regulation of gene
expression; and (2) potential crosstalk among different types of
PTMs. PTMs have a range of potential regulatory effects—from
quick, to ongoing, to long term.19,20 In immune and metabolic
responses, the transient and reversible nature of PTMs enables
the quick response needed to adapt to changes in the microen-
vironment.21–23 PTM effects on histone modiﬁcations, on the
other hand, can affect the long-lasting regulation of cellular pro-
grams; indeed, in cancer, aberrant histone acetylation can inac-
tivate tumor suppressors or activate oncogenes.24,25 In DNA
repair processes, phosphorylation plays a key role in regulating
the activity of DNA repair proteins,26 and PTM-focused analyses
may better characterize the landscape of DNA repair, particularly
in DNA repair-deﬁcient cancers. Finally, serine/threonine phos-
phorylation and lysine acetylation are among the most wide-
spread and conserved PTMs in eukaryotic organisms. Although
most studies to date have focused on how a single PTM type can
regulate cellular processes, the recognition that proteins harbor
multiple PTM types suggests that they may act together to jointly
manifest complex regulatory effects, many of which remain
largely unexplored.
Overall, this is the ﬁrst pan-cancer study that details the exten-
sive regulation of acetylation and phosphorylation and their
shared patterns across cancer types. Together, our results
comprise a rich resource to explore and generate hypotheses
regarding PTM-governed processes in cancer that, after further
experimental validation, may identify new drug targets or sug-
gest novel ways to affect cancer biology.
RESULTS
Pan-cancer dataset overview
Previous CPTAC proteogenomic studies revealed protein-based
molecular tumor subtypes and identiﬁed cancer-speciﬁc path-
ways using PTMs. In this study, we integrate data across
CPTAC cohorts to enable a pan-cancer analysis of gene, protein,
and PTM patterns shared across cancer types. To accomplish
this, CPTAC pan-cancer working groups harmonized data from
all available cohorts using standardized pipelines for assessing
somatic mutations, somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs),
mRNA expression, protein abundance, phosphorylation, acety-
lation, and clinical data (Figure S1).27 The ﬁnal combined
dataset comprised 1,110 patients from 11 cohorts (Figure 1A).
Ten tumor types were part of CPTAC, including glioblastoma
(GBM),4 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),5
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD),6 lung squamous cell carcinoma
(LSCC),7 breast cancer (BRCA),8 pancreatic ductal adenocarci-
noma (PDAC),9 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC),10 high-
grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC),11 uterine corpus endo-
metrial carcinoma (UCEC),12 and colorectal adenocarcinoma
(COAD).13 An external medulloblastoma (MB) dataset28 was
also included, generated following the same protocols as the
CPTAC datasets for all available data types but lacking whole-
exome DNA sequencing. For each patient, we identiﬁed both
germline and somatic variants and quantiﬁed gene expression,
protein abundance, and PTM levels (STAR Methods). We de-
tected a median of 25,000 exonic germline variants and
320 exonic somatic mutations per patient, with median so-
matic mutation burdens that matched The Cancer Genome Atlas
cohorts (Figure 1B). As expected, a subset of UCEC and COAD
patients showed exceptionally high tumor mutational burden
(TMB), reﬂective of microsatellite instability (MSI) and polymer-
ase proofreading deﬁciencies (POLE and POLD1 exonuclease
domain mutants). In addition, we found that an average of

24,000 genes, including coding and non-coding, were ex-
pressed in any cohort (transcripts per million [TPM] R 0.1 and
R6 reads each in at least 20% of patients). We detected an
average of 10,000 proteins, 22,000 phosphosites, and
6,000 acetylation sites per patient (available for 6 cohorts)
(STAR Methods; Figures 1C and 1D).
Next, since we aimed to search for pan-cancer patterns, we
analyzed the overlap among genes, proteins, and PTM sites.
We found 21,000 genes to be expressed across all cohorts
(14,500 protein coding and 6,500 non-coding; Figure 1C);
moreover, 6,333 proteins were detected across all cohorts and
accounted for the majority of the data. Importantly, PTMs
show a more discrete pattern in each tumor type, with relatively
fewer shared across cohorts (Figure 1D, center and right panels;
Table S1). This may reﬂect their role in ﬁne-tuning responses at
the cell- and tissue-type level beyond that of gene or protein
expression alone.29,30
Pan-cancer PTM landscape
To explore shared PTM patterns across cancer, we ﬁrst inte-
grated the data types that were available across all 11 co-
horts—speciﬁcally, gene expression, protein abundance, and
phosphoprotein level data—while regressing out tissue-speciﬁc
effects to remove obvious differences among tumor types (Fig-
ures S1A–S1D; STAR Methods). We applied SignatureAnalyzer,
a
Bayesian
variant
of
non-negative
matrix
factorization
(NMF),31–33 across the 1,110 tumors represented by a combined
set of 14,057 features (see SignatureAnalyzer section in STAR
Methods) to obtain 33 pan-cancer multi-omic signatures.
Notably, most signatures had contributions from all 3 features
(Figure 2A; STAR Methods). In addition to deﬁning the signatures,
SignatureAnalyzer estimates the activity level of each signature
for each tumor. By assigning each tumor to its most active signa-
ture, we found that most signatures span multiple tumor types
(Figure S2A), suggesting that, in general, the signatures reﬂect
pan-cancer biological processes.
To characterize tumor subsets with both shared and divergent
biology, we performed hierarchical clustering of the samples
based on their activities across the 33 signatures, which more
robustly reﬂect the pan-cancer biological processes active in
each sample (Table S2; STAR Methods). In addition, to deﬁne
groups of samples that share their most prominent biology
(used for certain downstream analyses), we traversed the
dendrogram and deﬁned clusters based on their most frequent
dominant signature, identifying 26 non-overlapping terminal
clusters (Figures S2B and S2C). To further explore the biology
in each group, we performed pathway enrichment analyses at
the RNA, protein, and PTM levels (Table S2) and applied multiple
methods speciﬁcally tailored to identify PTM differences: (1)
CLUMPS-PTM (Figures S2D–S2F; STAR Methods), (2) The Ki-
nase Library,34 (3) CausalPath,35 (4) PTM signature enrichment
analysis (PTM-SEA),36 and (5) a method to predict differential ac-
tivity of histone regulators (PTM dedicated tools in the STAR
Methods). Aggregating the results allowed us to comprehen-
sively characterize differences in tumor biology across our
pan-cancer cohort.
We started our analysis by focusing on the top split in the
dendrogram comprising a signiﬁcant enrichment for DNA dam-
age response (DDR) and proliferation pathways (MYC and E2F)
on the left side of the split, and myogenesis and epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways on the right side (Fig-
ure 2A). We applied both a site-speciﬁc pathway enrichment
analysis—PTM-SEA as well as The Kinase Library that predicts
the PTM regulators based on their substrate speciﬁcity (PTM
dedicated tools in the STAR Methods). Both tools showed signif-
icant enrichment of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and
downregulation of p21-activated kinases (PAKs) in the left side
of the ﬁrst split (Figure 2B; Table S2). These results are consis-
tent with the pathway activation differences, since CDK-medi-
ated phosphorylation is associated with rapid cell proliferation,
whereas PAKs are associated with the actin cytoskeletal
remodeling and increased migratory phenotype that accom-
panies EMT.37
Using CLUMPS-PTM to identify clusters of correlated PTMs in
protein 3D structures (PTM dedicated tools in the STAR
Methods), we found 22 proteins with signiﬁcant clustering (false
discovery rate [FDR] < 0.1) of phosphosites that were upregu-
lated in the ﬁrst split when comparing the left vs. right side of
the dendrogram (Figure 2C). One of the top hits for signiﬁcant
phosphorylation clustering was SRSF2 (FDR = 0.044), a serine-
and arginine-rich splicing factor. The cluster falls within the
RRM-1 domain, and its phosphorylated form has been shown
to interact with E2F1 to promote transcriptional control of cell cy-
cle target genes such as cyclin E (Figures 2D and S2F), thereby
promoting cell proliferation in lung carcinoma cell lines.38
For acetylation sites, we found only one protein, ARID1A, with a
signiﬁcant clustering (FDR = 0.085). ARID1A is a SWI/SNF chro-
matin remodeler that is commonly mutated in cancer39 and plays
a complex role in tumorigenesis.40 The cluster is on the C-terminal
tail of ARID1A, within the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-binding

domain (Figures 2E and S2F). GR regulates many genes whose
products increase catabolism, reduce inﬂammation, and increase
cell survival.41 Increased acetylation in this cluster can potentially
block a ubiquitination site at the C-terminal of the protein,42 which
would reduce ARID1A degradation and potentially increase GR
signaling. We indeed observe a higher protein abundance of
ARID1A and GR targets on the left side of the dendrogram
(Figure 2F).
Mechanisms of PTM dysregulation in DNA repair-
deﬁcient tumors
Next, we leveraged our proteogenomic dataset to investigate
the effects of DNA repair deﬁciencies that are undetectable
at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. We ﬁrst extra-
cted mutational signatures across our cohort by applying
SignatureAnalyzer31–33,43,44 to ﬁve partitions of our dataset by
distinct environment and cell-intrinsic mutational mechanisms:
POLE/POLD1-exonuclease domain mutants, mismatch repair-
deﬁcient (MMRD), smoking-related, homologous recombination
deﬁciency (HRD)-related, and not HRD-related (Figure S3A;
STAR Methods). We extracted a total of 22 mutational signatures
representing 11 distinct mutational processes, including MMRD
and HRD (Figure 3A; Table S3; STAR Methods). Using these sig-
natures, we identiﬁed 57 MMRD and 88 HRD tumors (Figure S3B;
STAR Methods). Consistent with previous pan-cancer studies,
most MMRD tumors were from the COAD and UCEC cohorts
(21 and 28 tumors, respectively), whereas the HRD group en-
compassed 54 HGSC, 30 BRCA, and four PDAC tumors.45,46
HRD cancers rely on alternative repair pathways to mitigate
double-strand break (DSB) damage.47 To investigate the PTM-
directed activities of repair proteins in HRD cancers, we per-
formed differential expression analyses (across all feature types)
between HRD and homologous recombination-proﬁcient (HRP)
tumors across DNA repair genes, followed by CausalPath
analysis to identify causal relationships between PTMs and their
mediators (PTM dedicated tools in the STAR Methods). These
comparisons revealed signiﬁcant differences in the phosphory-
lation of 268/1,596 sites residing in 112/310 measured DNA
repair proteins. In particular, we found differences in 8/12 pro-
teins representing the microhomology-mediated end-joining
(MMEJ) pathway, which is the primary HRD compensatory
pathway (FDR % 0.1, Figure 3B; Table S3).48,49 Notably, we
found increased phosphorylation of three PARP1 phosphoryla-
tion sites, including PKA-mediated site S782 (FDR = 0.05) and
ATR-mediated site S179 (FDR = 0.05), which are known to regu-
late PARP1 activity.50–52 HRD tumors also exhibited signiﬁcantly
increased phosphorylation of POLQ on S1587 (FDR = 0.05).
POLQ promotes MMEJ by inhibiting RAD51-mediated HR, and
its loss has been shown to elicit synthetic lethality in HRD
tumors, including in cell lines resistant to PARP inhibition53,54
(Figure S3C); the functional effects of S1587 phosphorylation,
however, have not been well-studied. We additionally found
increased phosphorylation of EXO1 S714 (FDR = 0.04), an
ATM-mediated site that has been proposed to attenuate EXO1
activity and hinder homologous recombination (HR) as a result.55
Differential phosphorylation analysis thus revealed site-speciﬁc
modiﬁcations that may regulate mechanisms that compensate
for HR loss.
We observed that the 88 HRD tumors spread across the four
main branches of the dendrogram (clusters A–D, Figure 2A).
We therefore explored whether this partitioning reﬂected
different DNA repair activities, which could potentially associate
with different therapeutic vulnerabilities. First, we performed
principal component analysis (PCA) of the multi-omic signature
weights in HRD tumors to verify that their partitioning in the
pan-cancer dendrogram was maintained when focusing only
on these tumors. We found that even the ﬁrst principal compo-
nent (PC1) can separate these HRD clusters (Figure 3C). To char-
acterize the biological processes associated with each cluster,
we performed pairwise multi-omic differential expression ana-
lyses between A, B, and C (excluding D due to the small sample
size of n = 7). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that
B exhibited signiﬁcant upregulation of hypoxia-related proteins
compared with A and signiﬁcant downregulation compared
with C (FDR = 0.08 and 0.03, respectively; Table S3). Previous
cell line studies have described the relationship between hypoxia
severity and DDR, showing that acute hypoxia with periodic re-
oxygenation activated DNA repair pathways to mitigate reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-related DNA damage, whereas chronic
hypoxia stalled replication and suppressed DDR.56–59 We hy-
pothesized that B represented an acute hypoxia group, and C
a chronic hypoxia group. Indeed, GSEA also highlighted an up-
regulation of the ROS pathway at the mRNA level (FDR = 0.04);
DNA repair at the protein level (FDR = 0.02); and DNA replication
at both mRNA and protein levels in B compared with C
(FDR = 0.01, 0.02, respectively) (Figure 3D; Table S3). Similarly,

PTM-SEA detected in the acute hypoxia HRD cluster B
increased activity of the DNA damage signaling kinases ATM,
CHEK1, and CHEK2 (FDR = 0.09, 0.02, and 0.06, respectively)
as well as an enrichment of CDK1/2/4/6 activities (all FDR =
0.018; Table S3), as expected.56–58
In order to identify speciﬁc differences in regulators of DDR
proteins between acute and chronic hypoxia HRD tumors, we
applied CausalPath on all differentially expressed features.
CausalPath detected increased PARP1 and XRCC1 interaction
in the acute hypoxia HRD group through increased PARP1 pro-
tein (FDR = 0.09) and decreased phosphorylation of XRCC1 sites
S475, S485, and T488 (FDR = 0.102, Figure 3E).60 This interac-
tion facilitates XRCC1 recruitment to ROS-induced base lesions
and single-strand break sites, suggesting increased PARP1
activity in the base-excision repair (BER) pathway,61,62 which
is necessary for the PARP trapping mechanism of PARP inhibi-
tors.63 Further supporting increased PARP activity, GSEA
showed protein-level enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation
and downregulation of glycolysis pathways (FDR = 0.0007 and
0.08, respectively), consistent with a known pro-survival meta-
bolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation due to
PARP consumption of NAD+.64 Furthermore, CausalPath high-
lighted CDK2 phosphorylation of WRN S1133, which is further
supported by The Kinase Library (97.5th percentile of CDK2 sub-
strates) and is a known response to collapsed replication
forks49,65 (Table S3). Overall, phosphorylation-focused analysis
highlighted major differences in the PTM activity of DDR proteins
between the acute and chronic hypoxic HRD tumors that are
indistinguishable at the mutational signature level.
As opposed to the partitioning of the HRD tumors into four
groups, the MMRD tumors showed only tissue-driven separation
(Figure S3D), prompting us to analyze all the MMRD tumors
together. Similar to the HRD analysis, we ran differential expres-
sion analysis between MMRD and mismatch repair-proﬁcient
(MMRP) tumors across all feature types associated with DNA
repair genes (Table S3). As expected, due to common MLH1
promoter hypermethylation in MMRD tumors, depletion of
MLH1 RNA expression and protein abundance (FDR = 1 3
1033, 5 3 1030, respectively) were among the most signiﬁcant
differences. To characterize pathway-level differences, we per-
formed GSEA on all differentially expressed features (Figure 3F;
Table S3). Intriguingly, MMRD tumors exhibited upregulation of
DSB repair pathways at the mRNA level and downregulation at
the protein level (FDR = 0.09 and 0.01, respectively; box in Fig-
ure 3F). This difference is likely due to the fact that different
genes drive the mRNA vs. protein pathway activation levels (14
vs. 4 distinct leading edge genes, respectively). The 4 leading
edge proteins were MRE11, RAD50, NBN (which together form
the DSB sensing and signaling MRN complex66), and ATM
(FDR = 2 3 1017, 2 3 1018, 2 3 107, and 2 3 103, respec-
tively; Figure 3G). We investigated whether truncating microsat-
ellite mutations, which were previously found to be enriched in
RAD50, MRE11, and ATM,67–69 could explain the decreased
mRNA and protein levels of these genes. We found 16 patients
with truncating alterations in RAD50 (ten K722fs and four
N934fs frameshift indels), all of which were in the MMRD group
(16/49 vs. 0/142, FDR = 1 3 1010, Table S3; STAR Methods).
The analysis of MRE11 and NBN alterations was not sufﬁciently
powered due to a few truncating events (three and one, respec-
tively). Interestingly, we found a similar decrease in protein abun-
dance of MRE11, RAD50, and NBN in MMRD vs. MMRP cell
lines, but only a marginal decrease in MRE11 mRNA, and no
change (or even increase) in RAD50 and NBN, respectively (Fig-
ure S3E), raising the possibility that reducing one protein in the
complex may destabilize the complex and lead to degradation
of the other complex proteins. Further studies are needed to
explore the mechanisms of reduced expression of the MRN
complex in MMRD tumors.
Consistent with previous reports, we also found signiﬁcant
enrichment of ATM microsatellite indels in MMRD tumors (16/
49 vs. 3/142, FDR = 5 3 108; Table S3). Applying CausalPath
to the differential expression results revealed evidence of DSB
sensing and signaling defects due to ATM loss (Figure 3H).
MMRD tumors showed a decrease in ATM-mediated phosphor-
ylation of PRKDC (DNA-PKcs) at S3205 (FDR = 0.1), which in-
duces DSB repair signaling.69 We also found a decrease in
ATM and PRKDC-mediated phosphorylation of PNKP at S114
and T118 (FDR = 0.09, Table S3). Phosphorylation of these sites
is critical for PNKP retention at DSB sites and subsequent pro-
cessing of DSB ends prior to ligation in the NHEJ pathway.70,71
These results highlight that proteogenomic analyses can expose
effects of somatic deleterious alterations in MMRD tumors that
cannot be observed at the mRNA level alone.
PTM regulation of metabolic pathways affects tumor-
associated immune responses
The interplay between cell metabolism and the immune
response was previously established19,20; here, we aimed to
characterize the effects of PTM regulation on this interplay
across tumor types. First, we applied multiple methods that infer
immune inﬁltration and activity: (1) ESTIMATE,72 which esti-
mates the abundance of immune inﬁltration based on expression
levels of curated genesets; (2) ImmuneSubtypeClassiﬁer,73
which provides immune phenotypes at a granular level using a
classiﬁer approach; and (3) unsupervised clustering based on
enrichments of curated genesets from CIBERSORT.74 Our unsu-
pervised clustering approach revealed four broad immune sub-
types across different cancer types: immune-cold, -cool,
-warm, and -hot. These subtypes aligned with the results from
ESTIMATE and ImmuneSubtypeClassiﬁer (Figures 4A, S4A,
and S4B; Table S4). We observed a mixed tumor distribution in
the subtypes, except for the ‘‘immune-cold’’ subtype, which
was predominantly composed of brain tumors (93 out of 130
samples, Figure S4C), consistent with brain tumors typically be-
ing immune-cold due in part to the blood-brain barrier.75 Next,
we performed differential expression and pathway analyses in
these immune subtypes using estimated tumor-intrinsic expres-
sion by removing the contribution of the immune cells (Fig-
ure S4B; Table S4; STAR Methods). Similar to previous
studies,6,7 our immune-hot subtype showed an increase in
immune-related pathways (Figure 4B) as well as a signiﬁcant in-
crease of immunosuppressive markers, including IDO1, CD163,
ENTPD1, and PD-L1 (CD274) (immune-hot vs. immune-warm
FDR < 0.1, Figure S4D). The median fold change was lower
than was previously reported in LUAD, potentially due to the
large heterogeneity across cancer types (median FC differences

between immune-hot vs. immune-warm ranges between 0.32
and 1.5 vs. >1.9 in CPTAC LUAD6). We also found signiﬁcant
differences in acetylation levels across multiple metabolic
pathways in the immune-cool subtype, including propanoate
metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid (FA) meta-
bolism pathways (Figure 4B; FDR < 0.07). In these pathways,
acetylation is known to play an important inhibitory role.7,76,77
We observed high levels of acetylation in lipid metabolism path-
ways in the immune-hot group and low levels of acetylation in the
immune-cool subtype (FDR < 0.01), even after correction for pro-
tein abundance (denoted as acetylome_res in Figure 4B and
STAR Methods), suggesting that low acetylation levels poten-
tially contribute to the high activation of these pathways in im-
mune-cool tumors. Indeed, FA enzymes are known to control
speciﬁc gene expression,78 and this effect is mainly regulated
at the protein and PTM levels.79 Of note, immune-cold tumors
show a similar metabolic pathway activation as immune-hot tu-
mors, perhaps due to the fact that the brain mostly relies on
glucose as its energy source since it requires less oxygen for
ATP generation80 (although this explanation does not explain
why the few non-brain tumors clustered into the immune-cold
subtype, which is yet to be determined) (Figure S4E).
Next, we employed CLUMPS-PTM on the differentially regu-
lated sites among these immune subtypes to identify functional
regions on the 3D protein structures. The glycolytic domain of
the ALDOA enzyme, which is abundant in cancer,81 was found
to harbor a signiﬁcant cluster of 4 increased acetylated sites
in the immune-hot group (K147, K153, K200, and K230;
FDR < 0.12, subset to glycolysis proteins), three of which are
also known ubiquitination sites that can lead to protein degrada-
tion.42 The same domain harbored a signiﬁcant cluster of
increased phosphorylated sites (FDR = 0.06, subset to glycolysis
proteins) in the immune-warm group (Figure 4C top; Table S4). In
contrast, in the immune-cool group, multiple FA metabolic-
related proteins (e.g., HIBCH, FASN, and HADH) display clusters
of sites with decreased acetylation (FDR < 0.12, subset to FA
pathways). For instance, HADH has an essential role in FA
b-oxidation, and the eight signiﬁcantly reduced acetylation sites
are clustered on the 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydro-
genase NAD-binding domain of the protein; this domain also
contains the acetyl CoA-binding sites, which would allow the
binding and subsequent oxidative activity of the enzyme82,83
(Figure 4C, lower). Moreover, we detected a signiﬁcant cluster
of increased phosphorylation sites (S337, T338, and S339,
FDR = 0.0026) on the dehydrogenase E1 domain of BCKDH
known to catalyze the overall breakdown of alpha-keto acids
to acetyl-CoA.84 This phosphorylation was shown to be medi-
ated by BCKDK and inhibit BCKDH activity, further limiting the
levels of acetyl-CoA and increasing FA oxidation to support the
cell’s energy demand85 (Figure S4F).
We then performed PTM-SEA to identify the main regulators of
PTMs (e.g., kinases or phosphatases; Table S4). This analysis re-
vealed high enrichment of (1) CDK activity in the immune-cool
subtype, consistent with the high proliferation associated with
this subtype (additionally supported by The Kinase Library
enrichment results; Figure S4G) and (2) mTOR activity, a direct
regulator of FA metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation as
well as an indirect regulator of lipid homeostasis through
SREBP1.86 Moreover, the immune-cool subtype showed an in-
crease of FA uptake, both by transporters within the cell, such
as CPT1A (FDR < 7 3 107), and by cell-surface transporters
including (1) FABP4, (2) ABCA, and (3) CD36 (FDR < 1.3 3
104 immune-cool vs. immune-hot) (Figure S4H).
Recent studies have shown that lipid-enriched tumor microen-
vironments reduce the cytotoxicity of effector T cells21,87 since
they cannot metabolize long-chain FAs, leading to lipotoxicity
and exhaustion.23 Therefore, we tested the correlation of FA
acetylation levels with protein levels of immune-related effectors
(Figure 4D). We observed a signiﬁcant positive correlation
between downregulating FA acetylation sites and immune
response marker proteins in the interferon gamma (IFNg) and
cell cytotoxic pathways (Figure 4E). Some of the most signiﬁcant
associations were between GZMA and HADHA K214 and K759
(rho 0.3, p < 1 3 1013) and between CD38 and HADHB
K277 and K253 (rho 0.35, p < 1 3 1013). Moreover, a Spearman
correlation of single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) for CD8+ T cell
abundance estimated from CIBERSORT showed FA as the
fourth most signiﬁcantly correlated association after interferon
pathways (rho 0.23, FDR = 2 3 1013, Figure S4I). The observed
associations between PTM-regulated biological processes in
cancer cells and their neighboring immune cells are summarized
in Figure 4F.
Alterations in histone regulation by PTMs in cancer-
associated genes
Here, we leveraged the largest pan-cancer acetylation dataset to
comprehensively study histone acetylation and phosphorylation
patterns across the six cancer types with available acetylation

data (STAR Methods). To identify speciﬁc histone acetylation
patterns, we classiﬁed histone-related genes into the following
ﬁve categories: (1) the linker histone H1, (2) the four core histo-
nes H2A (including MACROH2A1, MACROH2A2, H2A.X, and
H2AZ1), (3) H2B, (4) H3, and (5) H4 (Figure 5A). We found that his-
tone acetylation partitioned into two structural groups, group 1
(H3, H4, and H1) and group 2 (H2A and H2B), with signiﬁcant cor-
relations among the mean acetylation proﬁles of each group for
pairs within the groups (all with rho > 0.4 and p < 2.2 3 1016) and
weaker to no correlation for pairs between the two groups
(0.15 < rho < 0.17) (Figure S5A). This is consistent with acety-
lation state coordination leading to enhanced nucleosome open-
ing and subsequent gene activation.88,89
Since tobacco smoking is known to impair histone deacety-
lase (HDAC) activity and affect histone acetylation,90 we sought
to better characterize these effects by evaluating the correlation
between smoking mutational signature and histone acetylation
in LUAD tumors, limiting to male patients to decouple effects
due to strong association between gender and smoking (p =
1 3 104, Figure S5B). We found two positive and two negative
signiﬁcant correlations (FDR % 0.1; Figure S5C).91–93 Among
these correlations was the previously described dose-depen-
dent relationship between smoking and H4-16 K9 and K13
acetylation (rho = 0.33, FDR = 0.09). We also found positive
correlations for H2AZ1 K8/K12 and H2AZ1 K12/K14 acetylation
(rho = 0.34 and 0.39, respectively; FDR = 0.08 and 0.06, respec-
tively) (Figure S5C; Table S6). Acetylation of these sites has been
shown to localize H2AZ1 to promoter regions of several cancer
genes (e.g., ERBB3, CDK4, and RASEF)94,95 and facilitate their
transcription96 (Figure 5B). Next, to explore the effect of smoking
on HDAC activity, we tested the correlation between smoking
and phosphorylation of HDACs. We found six signiﬁcant (FDR
% 0.1) positive correlations on four proteins, which are all com-
ponents of SIN3/HDAC complexes (Figure S5D). Among these
correlations was phosphorylation of HDAC2 S422 (rho = 0.36,
FDR = 0.04), which was shown to reduce deacetylase activity.97
Moreover, phosphorylation of this site was mediated by
CSNK2A1 kinase upon exposure to cigarette smoke extract.97
Following this analysis, we investigated potential transcrip-
tional consequences of smoking-related changes in histone
acetylation by correlating the smoking signature and ssGSEA
pathway scores (Figure S5E). Among the top signiﬁcant associ-
ations (FDR % 0.1 and rho R 0.15) was the expected upregula-
tion of G2/M checkpoint genes, consistent with previous studies
that associated cigarette smoke and increased proliferation
(FDR = 0.01, rho = 0.26, Figure S5F, left).98,99 We also identiﬁed
a signiﬁcant positive correlation with mTOR signaling genes
(FDR = 0.01, rho = 0.27, Figure S5F, right), which is consistent
with previous studies and may play a role in lung tumorigenesis
by altering cell proliferation and metabolism.100,101
Next, we investigated the association of key regulators (his-
tone acetyltransferases [HATs], HDACs, and bromodomain pro-
teins [BRDs]; STAR Methods) with histone acetylation levels. We
identiﬁed multiple positive associations between the protein
abundance of histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300 and various
acetyl sites, including N-terminal H2B acetyl sites such as K11,
K15, K16, and K20 (0.2 < b < 0.52; Table S5), consistent with
the reported substrate speciﬁcity of CBP/p300 for these sites
(Figure 5C).102 The protein abundance of the histone acetyltrans-
ferase NCOA1, a known co-activator of CBP/p300, was also
positively associated with H2BC9-K21 acetylation (b = 0.29).102
Additionally, we identiﬁed novel associations such as the posi-
tive correlation of H3C1 at K36 acetylation with HAT1 (b =
0.36). HAT1 was shown to promote acetylation of H3 at K14,
and its expression was associated with poor prognosis across
cancer types.103,104 We also observed negative associations:
HDAC5 protein abundance negatively correlates with H2BC14
K16 and K20 acetylation (b = 0.20). HDAC5, a known therapeu-
tic target, was shown to have a role in cell differentiation, stem-
ness, and proliferation in several cancer types.105
We also tested these associations within our 26 clusters and
indeed found cluster-speciﬁc correlations (Table S5). For
example, CBP showed a low correlation with H2B using all sam-
ples (b = 0.25), but a much stronger correlation when evaluating
tumors across cluster 22, which is enriched with brain tumors
(b = 0.65, Figure 5D). Furthermore, we tested the association be-
tween histone regulation and cancer hallmark pathways. We
found increased acetylation levels of EP300 on known activating
sites K1558 and K1560 when comparing the left vs. right side of
the rightmost side of the dendrogram’s second level (C vs. D,
Figure 2A) (FDR = 2.6 3 107),106 and a concordant increase
in the acetylation of the N-terminal H2A and H2B acetylation
sites regulated by CBP/p300 (H2AC21-K5K9, FDR = 0.052;
H2BC18-K16K20, FDR = 1.3 3 104).102 Moreover, GSEA
showed signiﬁcant enrichment of E2F and MYC transcription tar-
gets in tumors from cluster C (both FDR = 0.08). Consistently, we
found a signiﬁcant positive correlation between H3 acetylation
and E2F, MYC, and G2/M checkpoint pathways across the six
cohorts, likely reﬂecting increased transcription associated
with cell proliferation. We also observed a signiﬁcant positive
correlation between the acetylation of H3 at K27 and K36 and
MTORC1 signaling, consistent with previous studies.107

We then focused on how metabolic shifts across our pan-can-
cer immune subtypes affect the regulation of histones. Our
ﬁndings above indicated an increase in FA metabolism in im-
mune-cool tumors (relative to immune-hot), and we also observe
decreased acetylation at 22/61 histone acetylation sites relative
to immune-hot and at 31/61 sites relative to immune-warm
(FDR < 0.1, Figure 5E; Table S5). As previously shown, these re-
sults reﬂect a possible association between histone acetylation
and glycolytic ﬂux as well as cellular acetyl-CoA abundance
and availability in the different immune clusters.108
Finally, we analyzed the correlations between adjacent histone
phosphorylation and acetylation sites to better understand their
potential crosstalk (STAR Methods). Of the 81 histone acetylsite
and phosphosite adjacent pairs (up to ﬁve amino acids apart)
tested globally, we identiﬁed 12 as signiﬁcantly correlated
(FDR < 0.05; Table S5). For instance, H3F3A-S31 phosphoryla-
tion was strongly correlated with H3F3A-K27K36 acetylation
across all samples (rho = 0.38, FDR = 6.2 3 107), consistent
with S31 phosphorylation stimulating H3-K2 acetylation through
p300 activity109 (Figure 5F). In addition, the phosphorylation
levels of H3-S28 and acetylation of H3-K27 were positively
correlated (rho = 0.27, FDR = 3 3 105), consistent with S28

Crosstalk between protein phosphorylation and
acetylation in cancer
Motivated by the correlations between phosphorylation and
acetylation of adjacent sites in histones, we aimed to syste-
matically analyze this crosstalk across other proteins. Mech-
anistically, serine/threonine protein kinases are known for their
substrate speciﬁcity based on the amino acid sequence sur-
rounding their phosphorylation sites.111–113 We therefore asked
whether lysine acetylation adjacent to phosphoacceptor sites
can impact their ability to be phosphorylated.
We

lysine-PTM
selectivity
across 207 recombinant Ser/Thr kinases using degenerate pep-
tide substrates that compared modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed lysine at
the ﬁve adjacent amino acid positions in both the N- and C-ter-
minal directions from the phosphoacceptor site111,113–116 (Figure
6A). Globally, we observed a general selection against sub-
strates containing acetylated lysine across the kinome (Fig-
ure 6B). Nevertheless, there are some exceptions in which ki-
nases favor acetylated lysine over unmodiﬁed lysine to carry
out the phosphorylation of a nearby serine or threonine (Fig-
ure 6C). We observed a similar pattern of global selection against
trimethylated lysine, but to a smaller extent than acetylation,
possibly because trimethylation causes a smaller steric alter-
ation and preserves the positive charge on lysine (Figures S6A
and S6B). Together, our screen indicates that Ser/Thr kinases
discriminate between the PTM states of the lysines surrounding
the phosphoacceptor sites, and that lysine acetylation has the
potential to regulate Ser/Thr kinase function.
Using these kinase speciﬁcity patterns, we could potentially
identify the kinases involved in speciﬁc acetylation-phosphoryla-
tion crosstalks. Since different kinases may be active in various
cell types and states, we ﬁrst mapped the crosstalk in different
dendrogram branches that may each display shared kinase ac-
tivity due to their similar RNA, protein, and phosphorylation pat-
terns. We searched for potential acetylation-phosphorylation
crosstalk in adjacent pairs (up to ﬁve amino acids apart) on pro-
teins globally as well as in the dendrogram clusters (STAR
Methods). We identiﬁed a negative correlation between H3-3A
acetylation at K23 and phosphorylation at S28 in a dendrogram
branch that includes terminal clusters 22 and 23 (rho = 0.58,
FDR = 0.04, Figure 6D, top), suggesting that inhibitory crosstalk
is uniquely present in these tumors compared with all tumors
(rho = 0.08, FDR = 0.35 globally). Phosphorylation of S28 has
been reported to activate transcription,110 whereas acetylation
at K23 inhibits transcription.118 S28 on H3-3A is a reported sub-
strate for members of the aurora kinase (AURK) and PKA families
of kinases.119,120 Consistent with this ﬁnding, our substrate mo-
tifs for AurB and PKACB show selection against acetylated lysine
in this context (Figure 6D, bottom), indicating that K23 acetyla-
tion inhibits the ability of S28 to be phosphorylated by these up-
stream kinases.
We then explored the acetylation-phosphorylation crosstalk
across other proteins and identiﬁed 3,952 adjacent pairs among
579 patients (Figure 6E; STAR Methods). Among these, 74 pairs
showed a signiﬁcant negative correlation between their levels
(FDR < 0.1). Among the most statistically signiﬁcant examples
(FDR = 3 3 104) was S1375/K1378 on the centromeric
protein RSF1 (Figures 6F left and S6D; Table S6). RSF1 is an
essential mediator of mitosis known to be overexpressed in
many types of cancers.121 CDK1 has been reported to phos-
phorylate S1375 on RSF1 during G2/M, which facilitates recruit-
ment of the kinase PLK1 that promotes subsequent mitotic
events.122,123 In our peptide substrate assays, CDK1 strongly

favored serines/threonines that contained lysines three positions
in the C-terminal direction (+3K), matching the known motif for
RSF1; moreover, the phosphorylation was almost entirely abol-
ished when the lysine was acetylated (Figure 6F, right), consis-
tent with CDK1’s reduced ability to phosphorylate S1375 when
K1378 is acetylated, potentially explaining the observed nega-
tive correlation.
With our kinome-wide scoring system, we could also infer how
phosphorylation of RSF1 facilitates the next step in this signaling
cascade and the subsequent recruitment of PLK1 (Figure 6G).
PLK1 binds to peptides containing phosphorylated serine or thre-
onine that are directly preceded by an unmodiﬁed serine (S-pS/
pT)124 T1371 on RSF1 that matches this pattern. Therefore,
when CDK1 phosphorylates S1375,125,126 the phosphorylated
peptide becomes a substrate for a second phosphorylation event
by the ubiquitously expressed GSK3 kinases (GSK3 alpha/beta)
on T1371, after which the phosphorylated peptide can be recog-
nized by PLK1. Once lysine K1378 is acetylated, the entire
cascadeisinhibited.Altogether,thiscanexplainhowcrosstalkbe-
tween S1375/K1378 on RSF1 ultimately affects the recruitment
of PLK1.
DISCUSSION
PTMs are core regulators of signal transduction, and they play
major roles in protein-protein interactions, protein stability, and
localization, among many other essential functions. In this study,
we comprehensively investigated PTMs across 11 cancer types
and highlighted the contribution of PTMs to known cancer hall-
mark processes: (1) DNA repair, (2) immune response, (3) meta-
bolism, (4) histone regulation, and (5) kinase regulation. We
noted commonalities of these processes and PTM patterns
across cancer types as well as important distinctions. This rich
resource will enable additional investigation of PTMs across can-
cer types beyond the PTM work we describe here.
DNA repair deﬁciencies, such as HRD and MMRD, generate
patterns of somatic mutations throughout tumor development,
providing evidence of a given repair deﬁciency. Importantly,
these mutational signatures do not necessarily reﬂect the current
activities of repair pathways, which may be pertinent to under-
standing the variation in response to therapies that target DNA
repair genes (e.g., PARP and POLQ inhibitors, etc.). In-depth an-
alyses of DNA repair-deﬁcient cancers highlighted the ability of
phosphorylation-focused analyses to reveal and characterize
informative patterns that are undetectable at the genomic and
transcriptomic levels. Through our analysis of HRD clusters,
we found that signiﬁcant differences in the phosphorylation of
DNA repair proteins were strongly associated with hypoxia
severity. We found decreased activity of several DNA repair pro-
teins, including PARP1, in HRD tumors with chronic hypoxia,
potentially affecting their response to PARP inhibitors. Our pro-
teogenomic analysis of MMRD tumors linked recurrent RAD50
microsatellite indels with signiﬁcant decreases in the abundance
of the three proteins in the MRN complex, which is crucial for
DSB sensing and signaling. Through site-speciﬁc phosphoryla-
tion analysis, we identiﬁed further evidence of DSB repair
dysfunction, which may provide additional avenues for devel-
oping treatments for MMRD (i.e., MSI) cancers.
In general, immune responses are tightly regulated to tailor
each response to a given threat encountered by the host,
requiring rapid regulatory changes that can be achieved by
PTMs. Similarly, cellular metabolism requires the same ﬂexibility,
and PTMs therefore play an essential role in regulating both im-
mune and metabolic responses. As an example, these two pro-
cesses can be linked with growing evidence that cancer cell regu-
lation of lipid metabolism by PTMs on FA enzymes can have an
effect on the immune response.21–23 In this study, we identiﬁed
four expression-based immune clusters with diverse metabolic
phenotypes driven by acetylation. CLUMPS-PTM highlighted
ALDOA, a glycolysis-related protein, which has both signiﬁcant
clusters of altered phosphorylation and acetylation sites in the im-
mune-hot subtype that are associated with increased ALDOA ac-
tivity. Inhibition of ALDOA in mice reduced lung metastases and
prolonged survival.127 The immune-cool subtype showed an
increased activity of FA metabolism that was strongly correlated
with reduced IFNg expression, suggesting an important role of
FA in immune suppression. Recent studies demonstrated that in-
hibition of FA oxidation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can
restore sensitivity to venetoclax and azacitidine in cells that
became resistant.128,129 These results highlight that targeting lipid
metabolism in cancer may not only reduce the ability of tumor
cells to produce higher levels of energy but also promote a tumor
microenvironment that is more conducive to immune cell inﬁltra-
tion and activation.128,129 In addition, we identiﬁed an association
between
transcriptionally
active
metabolic
pathways
and
reduced histone acetylation, potentially due to the reduced avail-
ability of acetyl CoA that is used by the cell for both acetylation
and producing energy107; additional studies will be needed to
further investigate this regulation.
Finally, we performed a comprehensive analysis of crosstalk
between acetylation and phosphorylation using The Kinase
Library.34 This analysis revealed that most serine/threonine ki-
nases disfavor acetylated lysines in close proximity to the phos-
phorylation site (shown by signiﬁcantly negatively correlated
pairs of neighboring acetyl-/phosphor-sites), allowing us to pre-
dict the likely responsible kinases for the crosstalk.
In summary, PTMs are an integral part of the tumor cell’s adap-
tation and response to intracellular and environmental changes. A
deeper understanding of PTM-governed processes leading to
cancer initiation and progression has the potential to uncover
novel therapeutic targets, identify biomarkers of response to ex-
isting therapies, and extend our knowledge of cancer biology.
Limitations of the study
Genomic-based pan-cancer studies have proved to be highly
valuable resources for discovering new cancer driver genes and
shared dysregulated pathways, as well as for identifying action-
able therapeutic targets.16–18 Our proteogenomic pan-cancer
study was limited to 1,110 samples across 11 tumor types, and
we anticipate that larger-scale studies, including both more cases
and more cancer types, will increase our power to identify proteo-
genomic mechanisms underlying cancer. The analyses described
in this study are all based on bulk tumor material. Similar to single-
cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses,130–133 technologies
including single-cell proteomics, spatial proteomics, and laser
capture microdissection134–136 are likely to provide even more

valuable insights into tumor heterogeneity and the contribution of
speciﬁc cell types to cancer. Although comprehensive PTM-
focused research and analyses of PTM crosstalk are emerging
ﬁelds, some shortcomings are worth noting: (1) current mass
spectrometry analyses have relatively high false negative rates
that limit our ability to perform crosstalk analyses among PTMs;
(2) to fully establish crosstalk relationship between PTMs, a dou-
ble MS search for simultaneous detection of 2 or more PTMs
would be needed; and (3) although there is a growing body of
phosphorylation databases and kinase prediction tools, parallel
comprehensive acetylation databases and tools are currently
lacking, and the functional effects of many of the acetylation sites
reported in this study remain to be explored.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human subjects and clinical data
In this study, a comprehensive dataset was assembled, comprising a total of 1110 patients from 11 different cohorts. The cohorts
included 99 patients with glioblastoma (GBM),4 110 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),5 110 patients
with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD),6 108 patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC),7 121 patients with breast cancer
(BRCA),8 140 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC),9 110 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC),10
82 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC),11 95 patients with uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC),12 96
patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD)13 and 39 patients with Medulloblastoma (MB).28
This combined dataset comprises 531 males and 579 females, with an age range of 2-90 years (median age 62). Detailed clinical
data can be found in the companion Pan-Cancer resource manuscript.27
METHOD DETAILS
Genomics Data processing
Harmonized genome alignment
WGS, WES, RNA-Seq sequence data were harmonized by NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/
gdc-data-harmonization, which included alignment to GDC’s hg38 human reference genome (GRCh38.d1.vd1) and additional quality
checks. All the downstream genomic processing was based on the GDC-aligned BAMs to ensure reproducibility.
Somatic mutation detection
The Broad hg38 characterization pipeline. Patient whole exome sequencing (WES) data, i.e. WES sequences of patients’
matched tumor and blood normal samples, were analyzed using the Getz Lab’s production hg38 WES characterization pipeline.
While somatic whole genome sequencing data were available for 7 out of 10 cancer types, they were sequenced to an average
coverage of 15X, which would limit our discovery of subclonal mutations or clonal mutations in low tumor purity and/or high
ploidy samples.
The hg38 characterization pipeline runs on the Terra cloud-based analysis platform (https://terra.bio/). This pipeline is the standard
computational workﬂow used by the Getz Lab for characterizing a tumor sample’s somatic variants through contrastive computa-
tional analysis of matched tumor-normal WES BAMs. The pipeline’s analysis steps are organized into ﬁve modules: (1) DNA
Sequence Data Quality Control; (2) Somatic Copy Number Analysis; (3) Somatic Variant Discovery, which includes the discovery
of SNVs and indels; (4) Post-Discovery Filtering; and (5) merging of adjacent somatic SNPs into DNPs, TNPs and ONPs.

The DNA Sequence Quality Control module, at the head of the pipeline, employs (i) GATK4’s CalculateContamination (Ver GATK
4.1.4.1) tool to calculate the fraction of reads coming from cross-sample contamination and (ii) GATK4 Picard tools (ver GATK 4.0.5.1)
to validate the BAM ﬁles and collect multiple classes of metrics that can be used to evaluate sequencing data quality. The pipeline’s
Somatic Copy Number Analysis module runs the GATK4 Best Practices Workﬂow (ver GATK 4.1.4.1) for discovery of allele-speciﬁc
copy-number alterations.
The Somatic Variant Discovery module employs MuTect139 for detection of somatic single nucleotide variants and Manta+Strelka
v2137,138 for detecting small insertions and deletions (INDEL sizes up to 49 bases). Following this initial detection of somatic SNVs
(SSNV) and INDELs DeTiN140 (v1.8.9) was run to rescue SSNVs and INDELs called by MuTect and Strelka that may have been mis-
classiﬁed as germline variants due to contamination of normal tissue with tumor cells. The resulting SSNV and indel VCFs are each
run through the GATK4 Funcotator (ver GATK 4.1.4.1) to analyze detected variants for their function and produce annotated MAFs,
which are then merged into a single MAF containing candidate SSNVs and indels.
The Post-Discovery Filtering module runs a collection of ﬁlters in parallel on the merged annotated MAF to eliminate artifacts, germ-
line variants and common sequencing artifacts that occur in normal panels. The ﬁltered variant calls coming out of each ﬁlter are then
aggregated to create an ‘‘intersection MAF’’ containing only variants that pass all ﬁlters. These variants are then run through a mu-
tation validator that validates the calls with any available orthogonal sequencing data (e.g., from WGS sequencing, targeted
sequencing, low pass sequencing, RNA sequencing).
The ﬁnal stage of the pipeline employs a SNVmerger subworkﬂow which merges SNPs to DNP/TNP/ONPs and writes the resulting
oligonucleotides to a VCF, which are then re-annotated and merged into the earlier ﬁltered/validated variant MAF.
Washington University characterization pipeline. In parallel to somatic mutation calling done by the Broad pipeline, somatic muta-
tions and DNP calls were done by the Washington University characterization pipeline and are provided in detail in the companion
Pan-Cancer Driver manuscript.185
Callset Harmonization. The per patient variant calls employed by the CPTAC PanCAN working group were derived from the harmo-
nization of variant calls made independently by the Broad and Washington University.
ICE whole-exome capture technology was deployed by the Genomics Platform at the Broad Institute for all CPTAC projects.
Therefore, as a ﬁrst ﬁltering step, we removed calls outside of the ICE capture interval list. A panel-of-normals built from an aggre-
gation of normal blood samples from the CPTAC and TCGA cohorts, which is an integral part of the Broad’s somatic mutation calling
pipeline, was used to ﬁlter recurrent artifacts arising from calls made by the Washington University pipeline. In addition, indels were
left-aligned to make sure their representations were comparable.
While we got better concordance between the two pipelines, we observed 2 key differences:
1. Majority of divergent calls are of low variant allele frequency (VAF < 0.05)
2. The Broad’s pipeline calls long multiple nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs)
To mitigate (1), we ﬁrst removed all calls with VAF < 0.05 from both pipelines and rescued only high conﬁdent calls if either criteria is
satisﬁed:
a. If a low VAF variant is called from both pipelines
b. If a low VAF is only called by either pipeline, but is a cancer hotspot deﬁned in Hess 2019.152
To mitigate (2), long MNPs were collapsed to shorter MNPs by imposing a more stringent merging criteria that requires a 2bp gap
length at max.
C>A artifact in CPTAC2 cohorts. Using Asymtools243 we were able to identify a sequencing artifact affecting CPTAC2 whole
exome sequencing. Asymtools2 is a framework for visualizing mutational strand asymmetries. Asymtools2 illustrated a biased
enrichment of cytosine to adenine SNVs over guanine to thymine SNVs on the genomic reference strand at low allelic fractions, sug-
gesting a previously described process driven by oxidative damage of guanine to 8-oxoguanine after bait-DNA hybridization.153 We
further partitioned the C>A and G>T mutations with an allele fraction of less than 0.1 into their trinucleotide contexts, establishing the
G>T contexts as the null model for correction. We then corrected for the sequencing artifact by ranking each C>A mutation by its
allelic fraction and removed mutations until the number of C>A mutation counts were equal to those of the G>T mutations for
each context.
Functional Impact. Finally, the functional impact of harmonized calls was annotated with GATK Funcotator.

RNAseq data processing and quantiﬁcation
We processed the RNA-seq data from all cohorts using the GTEx/TOPMed pipeline described at https://github.com/broadinstitute/
gtex-pipeline/blob/master/TOPMed_RNAseq_pipeline.md.145 The samples were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh38

RNA-SeQC 2.3.6,155 and isoform expression was quantiﬁed with RSEM.156 We deﬁned ‘expressed’ across the combined 11 cohorts
using the following criteria: both (i) R0.1 TPM in R20% of samples and (ii) R6 reads in R20% of samples.
Proteomics data processing
Proteomics LC-MS/MS data interpretation
MS/MS spectra obtained from proteins/phosphosites and acetylation sites were interpreted by Spectrum Mill (SM) v 7.08
(proteomics.broadinstitute.org) to provide identiﬁcation and relative quantitation at the protein, peptide, and post-translational modi-
ﬁcation (PTM) phospho- and acetyl-site levels.
Personalized sequence databases
For searching all available datasets with LC-MS/MS, we generated a cohort-level personalized protein sequence database for each
tumor type starting with a base human reference proteome to which we appended non-redundant somatic and germline variants and
indels for each of the 100 participants/cohort. The base proteome consisted of the human reference proteome GENCODE 34 (ftp.
ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_34/) with 47,429 non-redundant protein coding transcript biotypes
mapped to the human reference genome GRCh38, 602 common laboratory contaminants, 2043 curated smORFs (lncRNA and
uORFs), and 237,427 novel unannotated ORFs (nuORFs) supported by ribosomal proﬁling nuORF DB v1.0157 for a total of
287,501 entries, which yield 16,645,198 distinct 9-mers. The nuORFs alone yield 8,612,372 distinct 9-mers and thus increase the
peptide search space by only a factor of 2. The personalized protein sequence entries were prepared by processing the individual
participant’s somatic and germline variant calls from whole exome sequencing data, described above, using QUILTS v3158 with no
further variant quality ﬁltering using an Ensembl v100 reference proteome and reference genome for sequence identiﬁers consistent
with the variant calling. GENCODE v34 is a contemporaneous subset of Ensembl v100 (March 2020). Using the SM Protein Database
utilities, the base reference proteome and individual patient proteomes were combined and redundancy removed to produce a
cohort-level protein sequence database and a variant summary table to enable subsequent mapping of sequence variants identiﬁed
in TMT multiplexed LC-MS/MS datasets back to individual patients.
Spectrum quality ﬁltering
For all datasets, similar MS/MS spectra with the same precursor m/z acquired in the same chromatographic peak were merged, the
precursor MH+ inclusion range was 800–6000, and the spectral quality ﬁlter was a sequence tag length > 0 (i.e., minimum of two
peaks separated by the in-chain mass of an amino acid).
MS/MS search conditions
Using the SM MS/MS search module for all datasets included the next parameters: ‘‘trypsin allow P’’ enzyme speciﬁcity with up to 4
missed cleavages; precursor and product mass tolerance of ± 20 ppm; 30% minimum matched peak intensityScoring parameters
were ESI-QEXACTIVE- HCD-v2, for whole proteome datasets, and ESI-QEXACTIVE-HCD-v3, for phosphoproteome and acetylome.
Allowed ﬁxed modiﬁcations included carbamidomethylation of cysteine and selenocysteine. TMT labeling was required at lysine, but
peptide N-termini were allowed to be either labeled or unlabeled. Allowed variable modiﬁcations for whole proteome datasets were
acetylation of protein N-termini, oxidized methionine, deamidation of asparagine, hydroxylation of proline in PG motifs, pyro-glutamic
acid at peptide N-terminal glutamine, and pyro-carbamidomethylation at peptide N-terminal cysteine with a precursor MH+ shift range
of -18 to 97 Da. For all PTM-omes, variable modiﬁcations were revised to omit hydroxylation of proline and allow deamidation only in
NG motifs. The phosphoproteome was revised to allow phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine with a precursor MH+ shift
range of -18 to 272 Da. The acetylome was revised to allow acetylation of lysine with a precursor MH+ shift range of -400 to 70 Da.
PTM site localization
Using the SM Autovalidation and Protein/Peptide Summary modules for the PTM-ome datasets results were ﬁltered and reported at
the phospho- and acetyl-site levels. When calculating scores at the variable modiﬁcation (VM) site level and reporting the identiﬁed
VM sites, redundancy was addressed in SM as follows: a VM-site table was assembled with columns for individual TMT-plex exper-
iments and rows for individual VM-sites. PSMs were combined into a single row for all non-conﬂicting observations of a particular
VM-site (e.g., different missed cleavage forms, different precursor charges, conﬁdent and ambiguous localizations, and different
sample-handling modiﬁcations). For related peptides, neither observations with a different number of VM-sites nor different conﬁdent
localizations were allowed to be combined. Selecting the representative peptide for a VM-site from the combined observations was
done such that once conﬁdent VM-site localization was established, higher identiﬁcation scores and longer peptide lengths were
preferred. While an SM PSM identiﬁcation score was based on the number of matching peaks, their ion type assignment, and the
relative height of unmatched peaks, the VM site localization score was the difference in identiﬁcation score between the top two lo-
calizations. The score threshold for conﬁdent localization, > 1.1, essentially corresponded to at least 1 b or y ion located between
two candidate sites that has a peak height > 10% of the tallest fragment ion (neutral losses of phosphate from the precursor and
related ions as well as immonium and TMT reporter ions were excluded from the relative height calculation). The ion type scores
for b-H3PO4, y-H3PO4, b-H2O, and y-H2O ion types were all set to 0.5. This prevented inappropriate conﬁdent localization assign-
ment when a spectrum lacked primary b or y ions between two possible sites but contained ions that could be assigned as either
phosphate-loss ions for one localization or water loss ions for another localization.
Protein grouping of PSMs, peptides, and PTM sites
Using the SM Autovalidation and Protein/Peptide summary modules, results were ﬁltered and reported at the protein level. Identiﬁed
proteins were combined into the same protein group if they shared a peptide with sequence length greater than 8. A protein group

could be expanded into subgroups (isoforms or family members) when distinct peptides were present which uniquely represent a
subset of the proteins in a group. For the proteome dataset the protein grouping method ‘‘expand subgroups, top uses shared’’
(SGT) was employed which allocates peptides shared by protein subgroups only to the highest scoring subgroup containing the pep-
tide. For the PTM-ome datasets the protein grouping method ‘‘unexpand subgroups’’ was employed, which reports a VM-site only
once per protein group allocated to the highest scoring subgroup containing the representative peptide. The SM protein score is the
sum of the scores of distinct peptides. A distinct peptide is the single highest scoring instance of a peptide detected through an MS/
MS spectrum. MS/MS spectra for a particular peptide may have been recorded multiple times (e.g., as different precursor charge
states, in adjacent bRP fractions, modiﬁed by deamidation at Asn or oxidation of Met, or with different phosphosite localization),
but are still counted as a single distinct peptide.
Peptide spectrum match (PSM) ﬁltering and false discovery rates (FDR)
Using the SM Autovalidation module, peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) for individual spectra were conﬁdently assigned by
applying target-decoy based FDR estimation to achieve <1.0% FDR at the PSM, peptide, VM site and protein levels. For the whole
proteome dataset, thresholding was done in 3 steps: at the PSM level, the protein level for each TMT-plex, and the protein level for
the cohort of 2 TMT-plexes. For the PTM-omes, phosphoproteome and acetylome datasets thresholding was done in two steps:
at the PSM level for each TMT-plex, and at the VM site level for the cohort of 2 TMT-plexes. In step 1 for all datasets, PSM-level
autovalidation was done ﬁrst and separately for each TMT-plex experiment using an auto-thresholds strategy with a minimum
sequence length of 7; automatic variable range precursor mass ﬁltering; with score and delta Rank1 - Rank2, score thresholds
were optimized to yield a PSM level FDR estimate for precursor charges 2 through 4 of < 0.8% for each precursor charge state
in each LC-MS/MS run. To achieve reasonable statistics for precursor charges 5-6, thresholds were optimized to yield a PSM-level
FDR estimate of < 0.4% across all runs per TMT-plex experiment (instead of per each run), since many fewer spectra are gener-
ated for the higher charge states.
In step 2 for the PTM-omes: phosphoproteome and acetylome datasets VM site polishing autovalidation was applied across both
TMT plexes to retain all VM site identiﬁcations with either a minimum id score of 8.0 or observation in n TMT plexes (n=4, 3, or 2 if > 20,
7, or 1 plexes/cohort, respectively). The intention of the VM site polishing step is to control FDR by eliminating unreliable VM site level
identiﬁcations, particularly low scoring VM-sites that are only detected as low scoring peptides that are also infrequently detected
across both TMT plexes in the study. Using the SM Protein/Peptide Summary module to make VM-site reports, the ubiquitylome
and acetylome datasets are further ﬁltered to remove peptides ending with the regular expression [^K][^K]k since trypsin and
Lys-C cannot cleave at a acetylated lysine. The [^K] means retain if unmodiﬁed Lys present in one of the last two positions to allow
for a missed cleavage with ambiguous PTM-site localization. C-terminally acetylated lysines are present in the acetylome dataset,
but have been shown to arise from artifactual modiﬁcation during TMT-labeling after trypsin digestion.
In step 2 for the whole proteome dataset, protein polishing autovalidation was applied separately to each TMT-plex experiment
to further ﬁlter the PSMs using a target protein level FDR threshold of zero. The primary goal of this step was to eliminate peptides
identiﬁed with low scoring PSMs that represent proteins identiﬁed by a single peptide, so-called ‘‘one-hit wonders.’’ After assem-
bling protein groups from the autovalidated PSMs, protein polishing determined the maximum protein level score of a protein
group that consisted entirely of distinct peptides estimated to be false-positive identiﬁcations (PSMs with negative delta for-
ward-reverse scores). PSMs were removed from the set obtained in the initial peptide level autovalidation step if they contributed
to protein groups that had protein scores below the maximum false-positive protein score. Step 3 was then applied, consisting of
protein polishing autovalidation across all TMT plexes in a cohort together using the protein grouping method ‘‘expand subgroups,
top uses shared’’ to retain protein subgroups with either a minimum protein score of 25 or observation in TMT plexes (n=4, 3, or 2
if > 20, 7, or 1 plexes/cohort, respectively). The primary goal of this step was to eliminate low scoring proteins that were infre-
quently detected in a cohort. As a consequence of these two proteins- polishing steps, each identiﬁed protein reported in the
study comprised multiple peptides, unless a single excellent scoring peptide was the sole match and that peptide was observed
in multiple TMT-plexes.
Quantitation using TMT ratios
Using the SM Protein/Peptide Summary module, a protein comparison report was generated for the proteome dataset using the pro-
tein grouping method ‘‘expand subgroups, top uses shared’’ (SGT). For the PTM-omes: phosphoproteome and acetylome datasets
Variable Modiﬁcation site comparison reports limited to either phospho- or acetyl-sites, respectively, was generated using the pro-
tein grouping method ‘‘unexpand subgroups.’’ Relative abundances of proteins and VM-sites were determined in SM using TMT re-
porter ion log2 intensity ratios from each PSM. TMT reporter ion intensities were corrected for isotopic impurities in the SM Protein/
Peptide Summary module using the afRICA correction method, which implements determinant calculations according to Cramer’s
Rule and correction factors obtained from the reagent manufacturer’s certiﬁcate of analysis for each cohort. Each protein-level or
PTM site-level TMT ratio was calculated as the median of all PSM-level ratios contributing to a protein subgroup or PTM site.
PSMs were excluded from the calculation if they lacked a TMT label, had a precursor ion purity < 50% (MS/MS has signiﬁcant pre-
cursor isolation contamination from co-eluting peptides), or had a negative delta forward-reverse identiﬁcation score (half of all false-
positive identiﬁcations). Using the SM Process Report module non-quantiﬁable proteins and PTM sites (e.g., unlabeled peptides con-
taining an acetylated protein N-terminus and ending in arginine rather than lysine) were removed, and median/MAD normalization
was performed on each TMT channel in each dataset to center and scale the aggregate distribution of protein-level or PTM site-level
log-ratios around zero in order to nullify the effect of differential protein loading and/or systematic MS variation.

Normalization of phosphosites and acetylation sites
For downstream analyses with PTM data, we perform ordinary least squares ﬁt using statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS for
every matched value of protein and PTM site aligned by accession number (RefSeq) (Figure S1). The residuals from this are ‘‘cor-
rected’’ phosphoproteome and acetylome values we term as ‘‘phosphoproteome_res’’ or ‘‘acetylome_res.’’
Patient Signatures & Clustering
Transcriptomics
For downstream analyses, TPM values were scaled using DESeq2 size factors and then log2(x+1) transformed. Three cohorts (BRCA,
HGSC, COAD, from CPTAC2) were sequenced with a polyA selection protocol, with the remainder sequenced with a total RNA pro-
tocol (rRNA-depleted using RiboZero, from CPTAC3). Medulloblastoma was also sequenced with a total RNA protocol. This protocol
batch effect was regressed out from the log-transformed values using COMBAT.159 Finally, the 5,000 genes with the highest coef-
ﬁcient of variation were selected as inputs to clustering.
Proteomics
We ﬁrst selected phospho-sites that were fully localized using mass spectrometry. Then, within each cohort, we ﬁltered out any pro-
teins or phosphoproteins that were identiﬁed based on SM criteria in less than %25% of samples (Figure S1A). After this, we further
subset the feature space to include only detected proteins & phospho-sites across all 11 cohorts to avoid imputation across entire
cohorts. Within each cohort, we then used K-nearest neighbors to impute missing values with sklearn.impute.KNNImputer with K=5.
Finally, to correct phosphoproteome levels for protein abundance, we performed ordinary least squares ﬁt described in the prote-
omics data processing Section (above) with ﬁltered and imputed data (Figure S1A).
Combining Multi-Omic Data
Across all 11 cohorts, the shared data types available for clustering were whole transcriptome RNA-seq, proteome, and phospho-
proteome. To harmonize the RNA data with the normally distributed proteomic data, we applied an inverse normal transformation,
median centered the data, and scaled the data using median absolute deviation. We selected samples that had matched RNA,
protein, and phosphoprotein in the entire dataset and concatenated these 3 matrices. To reduce the transcriptome space to a com-
parable feature size to the proteome data, we selected the top 5,000 highly variable genes, ranked by coefﬁcient of variation. The
combined matrix contained gene expression for 5,000 highly variable mRNA protein coding genes, 5,716 proteins, and 3,341 phos-
phoproteins for 1,110 patients across 11 cancer types. Prior to any cohort-level correction, we found that cohort and tissue-speciﬁc
effects were the dominant source of variation in multi-omic data (Figures S1C and S1D). We therefore performed cohort-level batch
correction by regressing out the cohort effects (as dummy-coded covariates/ indicator variables) from the combined matrix.
Multi-Omic Signatures
We derived the expression signatures using SignatureAnalyzer (https://github.com/getzlab/SignatureAnalyzer), a Bayesian variant
of non-negative matrix factorization (ARD-NMF).33,160,161 To use this tool with zero-centered, normally distributed data,
SignatureAnalyzer splits the input matrix into positive and negative matrices before running the decomposition (Table S2). L2 priors
were imposed on both the W and H matrices, and a Gaussian objective function was used. SignatureAnalyzer was run 100 times with
random initialization, and the solution with the best objective function with the mode number of signatures (k=33) was selected
(robustness analysis and additional support is provided in Note S1). To annotate these 33 signatures, we performed ranked gene-
set enrichment analysis using fGSEA with factor weight as the rank.
Sample-Sample Clustering
To further cluster samples using the 33 derived expression signatures, we created a similarity matrix based on cosine similarity of the
H-matrix (samples x signatures) derived from the SignatureAnalyzer algorithm. We then performed hierarchical clustering using
euclidean distance as the metric and Ward linkage using SciKit-learn. For downstream analysis, we compared each pair of sample
clusters at each split of the dendrogram (see differential expression).
Immune clustering
To estimate the abundance of immune cell-types and signatures in each sample, we ran multiple bulk RNA deconvolution
approaches. We ran CIBERSORT with the LM22 signature matrix74 using the re-processed CPTAC transcriptomic TPM data for
all 11 cohorts. We also ran ESTIMATE72 as a separate approach for estimating tumor purity and immune inﬁltration using
TPM data. Finally, we ran ImmuneSubtypeClassiﬁer73 to classify samples into different ‘‘immune types’’. The methods for the im-
mune analysis are provided at https://github.com/getzlab/CPTAC_PanCan_2021/blob/master/analysis/Fig_immuno_metabolism/
runImmuneDeconv.R. To identify broad immune clusters to probe differences in immune signals and changes in metabolic levels
using matched protein and PTM data, we ran gene set enrichment analysis using the gene sets from CIBERSORT’s LM22 matrix
on the z-scored transcriptomic TPM data. Next, we performed hierarchical clustering using euclidean distance and Ward-linkage
with SciKit-learn162 and selected K=4 to identify 4 broad ‘‘immune clusters’’ for downstream use. To perform differential expression
analysis for each immune subtype, we used a ‘one vs. rest’ approach. We additionally corrected for cancer type (i.e., cohort) by
modeling it as a ﬁxed covariate along with the estimated immune abundances from CIBERSORT for ‘‘Macrophages_M0’’, ‘‘Macro-
phages_M1’’, ‘‘Macrophages_M2’’, ‘‘T_cells_CD8’’, and ‘‘T_cells_CD4_memory_resting’’ to better separate tumor intrinsic expres-
sion from contributions of the immune microenvironment.

Interpretive data analysis
Variant call tools
GISTIC. The Genomic Identiﬁcation of Signiﬁcant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC2.0) algorithm143 was used to identify signiﬁcantly ampli-
ﬁed or deleted focal-level and arm-level events, with q value <0.25 considered signiﬁcant. The following parameters were used:
Ampliﬁcation Threshold = 0.1, Deletion Threshold = 0.1, Cap Values = 1.5, Broad Length Cutoff = 0.98, Remove X-Chromosome =
0, Conﬁdence Level = 0.99, Join Segment Size = 4, Arm Level Peel Off = 1, Maximum Sample Segments = 2000, Gene GISTIC = 1.
Each gene of every sample is assigned a thresholded copy number level that reﬂects the magnitude of its deletion or ampliﬁcation.
These are integer values ranging from -2 to 2, where 0 means no ampliﬁcation or deletion of magnitude greater than the threshold
parameters described above. Ampliﬁcations are represented by positive numbers: 1 means ampliﬁcation above the ampliﬁcation
threshold; 2 means ampliﬁcation larger than the arm level ampliﬁcations observed in the sample. Deletions are represented by nega-
tive numbers: -1 means deletion beyond the threshold; -2 means deletions greater than the minimum arm-level copy number
observed in the sample.
MutSig2CV. The somatic variants were ﬁltered through a panel of normals to remove potential sequencing artifacts and undetected
germline variants. MutSig2CV144 was run on these ﬁltered results to evaluate the signiﬁcance of mutated genes and estimate muta-
tion densities of samples. These results were constrained to genes in the Cancer Gene Census,163 with false discovery rates (q
values) recalculated. Genes of q value < 0.1 were declared signiﬁcant.
Mutational signatures using SignatureAnalyzer
Mutational signatures were extracted for all cohorts, excluding MB since WES data was unavailable. This analysis was done using
SignatureAnalyzer (https://github.com/getzlab/SignatureAnalyzer), a Bayesian Non-negative matrix factorization algorithm that in-
fers an optimal collection of signatures from the data (additional details are provided in Note S1). We performed a multi-step signature
extraction workﬂow to mitigate noise and bias introduced by hypermutated samples with high leverage, an issue particularly exac-
erbated when solely using exomes.
We ﬁrst focus on the 13 patients with missense mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLE or POLD1 (referred to as POLE-exo*
or POLD-exo*) since they have a unique mutational signature that requires a special analysis. For these tumors, we applied
SignatureAnalyzer using the 96 tri-nucleotide sequence context for single-base substitutions (SBSs) and a length-based context
for insertions and deletions.164 Analyzing these tumors using this particular spectra allowed us to detect 7 distinct signatures, 6 of
which had strong similarity (cosine similarity > 0.75) with the previously reported signatures in POLE/POLD-exo* tumors.164 In order
to control for a single DNA repair deﬁciency in our study, we do not include POLE/POLD-exo* samples in downstream MMRD (i.e.,
MSI) analyses.
We then applied SignatureAnalyzer on the remaining 1056 samples using the standard composite spectra that includes the 96 tri-
nucleotide sequence context for single-base substitutions (SBSs), 78 double-base substitutions (DBSs), and 83 indel features (ID), as
performed in Alexandrov et al.44 Among the extracted signatures was one resembling a signature (SBS15) associated with MMRD in
previous studies (cosine similarity 0.82). We inspected the distribution of this MMRD signature in COAD and UCEC samples, which are
known to have higher incidences of MMRD (i.e., MSI). The minimum signature weight in these samples with evidence of mismatch
repair deﬁciency, as evidenced by their non-trivial contributions from the signature, was 72 mutations, and 19% of these mutations
were attributed to this MMRD signature. Thus, we set a threshold of 72 mutations and 19% of mutations from this SBS15-like signature
to identify MMRD tumors across our dataset (Figure S3B). Finally, since several known signatures associated with MMRD were
merged together in the composite analysis, we re-ran SignatureAnalyzer using only the 96 SBS features on the MMRD samples
and indeed recapitulated (cosine similarity > 0.85) the known MMRD-associated signatures from the COSMIC v3 catalog of signatures.
We partitioned the remaining patients into three groups by their tissue type: tobacco smoking related included LSCC, LUAD, and
HNSCC; homologous recombination deﬁciency (HRD) related included BRCA, OV, and PDAC; and non-homologous recombination
deﬁciency related included CCRCC, COAD, GBM, and UCEC. We used the tri-nucleotide SBS context to extract signatures from the
HRD related and non-HRD related tumors, and we characterized these signatures by computing cosine similarity with the COSMIC
v3 signatures.
Tobacco smoking and UV exposure (in HNSCC cancers) serve as primary mechanisms of mutagenesis in the tobacco smoking
related group, and these processes have been shown to cause a wide range of single and double base substitutions as well as in-
dels.44 Thus, we employed a composite spectra to isolate the effects of the various mutational processes in these patients, and char-
acterized them by computing their cosine similarity to those found in the PCAWG study.44
Identifying homologous recombination deﬁciency using whole exome data remains challenging due to its ﬂat single-base substi-
tution landscape as well as a reduction in microhomology coverage in exomes. Further complicated by the composite reference’s
whole genome calibration, we opted to use the trinucleotide SBS spectra for this group of patients, as well as for the remaining
COAD, UCEC, CCRCC, and GBM patients.
As previously described, whole exome sequencing provides less power for non-negative matrix factorization, such that signature
bleeding can present particularly misleading attributions for low mutation burden patients. In order to more conﬁdently classify HRD
tumors, we leveraged germline exome data to identify tumors with known pathogenic variants from the ClinVar database or variants
considered as ‘‘HIGH IMPACT’’ by ClinVar on BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2. We found that breast and ovarian tumors with these var-
iants that also showed relatively high contributions from the HRD mutational signature had more than 45 mutations attributed to the

signature (Figure S3B). Thus, we set our threshold for HRD classiﬁcation to any tumor with greater than or equal to 45 mutations
attributed to the HRD mutational signature.
HRD vs HRP Analysis
We note that classifying HRD tumors using only exome somatic and germline mutation data remains challenging, particularly due to
substantially low power to detect microhomology indels, a crucial component to HRD detection.165 To prevent over-classiﬁcation of
HRP tumors for this analysis, we selected the bottom 20% of samples based on their HRD mutational signature contributions from
both HGSC andBRCA cohorts.In orderto limitrepairdeﬁciencies to HR, we excludedanyMMRD orPOLE exonuclease mutanttumors.
In addition, due to the smallnumber of PDAC classiﬁed as HRD (4 patients), we focused thisanalysison breastandovarian HRDtumors.
Differential Expression
RNA
Differential expression was performed using Limma-Voom.166 The trimmed mean of M values (TMM) between-sample norma-
lization167 was applied to counts using calcNormFactors, the voom transformation was applied using limma::voom, and limma::lmFit
was used for the moderated t-test, followed by empirical bayes shrinkage with limma::eBayes. The cancer type (i.e., cohort) was
modeled as a ﬁxed covariate in each analysis unless otherwise speciﬁed. FDR is computed using the Benjamini-Hochberg proced-
ure. Versions used were edgeR_3.28.1, limma_4.32.2, and R version 3.6.1.
Protein, Phosphorylation, Acetylation
Differential expression was performed using Limma on median-MAD normalization matrices output from SpectrumMill v 7.08. lim-
ma::lmFit was used for the moderated t-test, followed by empirical bayes shrinkage with limma::eBayes. No imputation was per-
formed prior to differential expression analyses. Proteins & PTM-sites were ﬁltered out if they were present in <10 patients in either
group being compared. The cancer type (i.e., cohort) is modeled as a ﬁxed covariate in each analysis unless otherwise speciﬁed.
Versions used: limma_4.32.2 and R version 3.6.1.
fGSEA
Gene-set enrichment analysis was performed using fGSEA (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/fgsea.html). To
evaluate RNA- and protein-level enrichment in the context of differential expression analyses, we ranked genes by the product of
log2(Fold Change) and -log10(P-value). We analyzed the enrichment of phosphorylation and acetylation of gene sets in differential
expression analyses by collapsing each gene to its maximum absolute value product of log2(Fold Change) and -log10(P-value) of
all corresponding peptides. To apply fGSEA to the results of SignatureAnalyzer, we performed ranked gene-set enrichment analysis
by ranking the factor weights (i.e., the weights within each signature were used to rank the genes to carry out ranked gene-set enrich-
ment analysis for each signature).
Dedicated tools for PTM analysis
Additional details and use cases for the PTM dedicated tools can be found in Note S2.
PTM-SEA
We evaluated site-speciﬁc phosphorylation pathway enrichment using PTM-SEA (https://github.com/broadinstitute/ssGSEA2.0).
Enrichment was run using the sites’ ﬂanking amino acids, using the ptm.sig.db.all.ﬂanking.human.v1.9.0.gmt database. We em-
ployed the heuristic method introduced by Krug et al.36 to deconvolute multiple phosphorylated peptides to separate data points
(for differential expression analyses, ranks were based on -10 * log10 (p value) * sign(log2(fold change)); for SignatureAnalyzer results,
the factor weights of phosphorylation features were used at the rank).
CLUMPS-PTM
Mapping Sites
Every PTM site detected in this study was ﬁrst mapped to UniprotKB to select for canonical isoforms and for ease of downstream
alignment with PDB structures. blastp+ was run on every fasta sequence from the CPTAC reference (RefSeq) used for mass-spec
quantiﬁcation for Spectrum Mill and queried to the entire UniprotKB Sequence database. To select the appropriate hit for each
RefSeq ID blasted to UniprotKB, the top hit by identity overlaps from blastp+ was selected after ﬁltering for Uniprot IDs found in
the SIFTS protein database. The SIFTS protein database was used for highly curated annotations between Uniprot protein IDs
and their respective PDB structures. Next, each matched Uniprot was selected, and every matching PDB in the SIFTS protein data-
base was checked for sequence overlap. The DBREF entry in each PDB header was used to identify the offset between the Uniprot
sequence and PDB sequence. Finally, the PDB entry with the most overlap between sites found in CPTAC and longest sequence
length was selected as the matching PDB entry.
Algorithm
The method is based on the CLUMPS method (CLUstering of Mutations in Protein Structures) for detecting signiﬁcant clusters of
mutations in 3D protein structures.168 Here we search for signiﬁcant clustering of differentially acetylated/phosphorylated sites.
For sites mapped to an individual PDB structure, we computed an initial weighted average proximity (WAP) score based on matched
PTM sites. Succinctly, WAP scores (see formula below) are a summation of all residue pairs (q and r), weighted by the product of the

strengths of each individual residues (nq or nr, respectively) and their distances (with a Gaussian decreasing weight using a scale
parameter t) in the 3D protein structure. The original CLUMPS was designed to analyze mutations and the strength of each residue
was the number of mutated patients at that residue. In CLUMPS-PTM, we use the differential phosphorylation/acetylation of each
PTM-modiﬁed residue. The formula is:
WAP =
X
q;r
nqnre
d2
q;r

where q and r are protein residues; dq,r is the Euclidean distance (in A˚ ) between the centroids of these residues; nq and nr are the
weights of each modiﬁcation (i.e log2(fold-change) * -log10(FDR) in CLUMPS-PTM); and t is distance scale parameter (in A˚ ). Empirical
p-values are calculated by permuting the altered residues in the protein. In CLUMPS-PTM, we only test permutations of PTMs to other
PTM-possible sites (e.g., only lysines are sampled for acetyl-sites). In our analysis, we wanted to average across a range of scale pa-
rameters and therefore used t=3, 4.5, 6, 8, 10, and run 10,000 permutations for each, and generate a mean empirical p-value across
these parameter values. Finally, we used sites that mapped to the PDB structure and were differentially expressed (log2(fold change)
>0; see Differential Expression). Two steps were taken before FDR correction of the empirical p-values. First, if the empirical p-values
were zero, representing an insufﬁcient number of permutations, we set the p-values to 0.1 over the number of permutations. Next, we
reduced the number of hypotheses tested by excluding proteins from the FDR procedure if the most signiﬁcant p-value that the protein
and associated sites could theoretically yield is greater than 0.1. The minimal theoretical p-value is given by

Finally, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct empirical p-values for multiple hypothesis testing. The code to
perform all analyses is available in a python package at https://github.com/getzlab/CLUMPS-PTM.
The Kinase Library
Serine/threonine kinase substrate speciﬁcity assays: Assays, matrix processing, and scoring process were previously described at
Johnson et al.34
The Kinase Library enrichment analysis
Thephosphorylationsitesdetectedinthisstudywerescoredbyallthecharacterizedkinases(303Ser/Thrkinases),and theirranksinthe
known phosphoproteome score distribution were determined as described above (percentile score). For every non-duplicate, singly
phosphorylated site, kinases that ranked within the top-15 kinases for the Ser/ Thr kinases were considered as biochemically predicted
kinases for that phosphorylation site. Towards assessing a kinase motif enrichment, we compared the percentage of phosphorylation
sitesforwhicheachkinasewaspredicted amongthesigniﬁcantlydownregulated/upregulatedphosphorylationsites(i.e.,siteswithFDR
% 0.1), versus the percentage of biochemically favored phosphorylation sites for that kinase within the set of unregulated (non-signif-
icant)sites in thisstudy (siteswithFDR> 0.1). Contingency tableswere corrected using Haldane correction (adding0.5to the cases with
zero in one of the counts). Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using one-sided Fisher’s Exact test, and the corresponding p-values
were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Kinases that were signiﬁcant (FDR % 0.1) for both upregulated and downre-
gulated analysis were excluded from downstream analysis. Then, for every kinase, the most signiﬁcant enrichment side (upregulated or
downregulated) was selected based on the adjusted p-value and presented in the bubble plot. Bubble plots were generated with size
and color strength representing the adjusted p-values and frequency factors respectively, only displaying signiﬁcant kinases.
Modiﬁed lysine peptide library assays
Reagents used for the peptide library experiments include: Kinase substrate library (Anaspec); Streptavidin-conjugated membranes
(Promega). A list of kinase information can be found in a previous study.34 To determine the substrate motifs, we performed in vitro
phosphorylation assays with recombinant kinases on an oriented peptide array library of design:
Y-A-X5-X4-X3-X2-X1-S0/T0-X1-X2-X3-X4-X5-G-K-K-biotin in the presence of ATP[g-32P]. Unmodiﬁed, tri-methylated, and
acetylated lysines were ﬁxed in every position across the peptide. Reactions were carried out in their designated buffers plus
20 mM ATP and 0.4 mCi of (33 nM) [g-32P]ATP) at 30C for 90 min. The peptides were spotted onto streptavidin-coated ﬁlter sheets
(Promega SAM^2 biotin capture membrane) and visualized by phosphorimaging on Typhoon FLA 7000. Detailed information on the
protocol is provided elsewhere.111,116
CausalPath
For each differential expression table that we generated in this study, we applied the CausalPath method35,169 to identify possible
cause-effect relationships between the detected differential values, and to understand the molecular signaling behind those
changes. CausalPath uses literature-curated human mechanistic pathways to identify which protein activities have control over
the observable features in the omics studies. The method uses this information to perform logical reasoning over the observed dif-
ferences, and generates a network of causal relations. Generated networks are tested by data label randomization to identify enrich-
ments that indicate activation/inhibition of certain regulators.
In these CausalPath analyses, we integrated global protein, phosphoprotein, acetylprotein and mRNAseq datasets, and used a 0.1
FDR threshold. To include biologically relevant edge cases, we included RAD18 S99, XRCC1 S475/S485/T488, and CDK1 T14 (all

FDR=0.102) for the acute versus chronic hypoxia HRD analysis, TOP2A S1247 (FDR=0.102) for the global HRD vs. HRP analysis, and
PRKDC S3205 (FDR=0.1009) for the MMRD vs. MMRP analysis. To manage the complexity of the result networks and to focus on
speciﬁc pathways, we generated sub-networks of results by taking graph neighborhoods of pre-deﬁned gene sets encompassing
DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR gene set (Table S3) includes the union of the Reactome DNA Repair gene set and the
CPTAC DNA-Damage Response (DDR) Working Group gene set (unpublished). We also included CDK1/2/4/6, AURKA, AURKB,
PLK1/2/3/4/5, and WEE1 to account for cell cycle checkpoint kinases.
We also used CausalPath to investigate the downstream effects of the kinase activity predictions made by the Kinase Library
method. We inserted the predictions of the Kinase Library as custom hypotheses to CausalPath to ﬁnd out which differential changes
are compatible/explainable by those predicted activities.
We used the Newt software170 to visualize the CausalPath results and to generate Figures 3E, 3H, and S3C.
Histone analysis
For Histone analysis we used 6 cancer types with available acetylation data (5 from the CPTAC cohorts): breast, uterine, glioblas-
toma, lung squamous, and lung adenocarcinoma in addition to one external dataset, medulloblastoma, that was generated and
harmonized in the same manner as the CPTAC cohorts. For the global analysis, we included only acetylation sites that were detected
in all cohorts. These summed up to a total of 61 histone acetylation sites: 21 sites on H1, 10 sites on H2A, 16 sites on H2B, 10 sites on
H3, and 4 sites on H4.
Histone-level correlations
The imputed acetylation data was subset for histone genes by mapping RefSeq IDs to HGNC IDs, and within each group of histones
(H1, H2A, H2B, H3, H4), the relative abundance of all sites within this group was averaged. Spearman correlations and p values were
calculated for each of the 10 pairs.
Histone acetylation and smoking analysis
We used Spearman’s rank correlation to evaluate associations between the tobacco smoking mutational signature and histone acet-
ylation and deacetylase phosphorylation, and we used Benjamini-Hochberg to control the FDR. We additionally calculate the 95%
conﬁdence intervals for each correlation shown in Figure 5B through bootstrapping. We sampled from the data with replacement
10,000 times and computing the Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient each time. Using this distribution of correlation coefﬁcients,
we determined the 95% conﬁdence interval for the correlations between the PTM sites and tobacco smoking mutagenesis. We
limited this analysis to LUAD tumors, since this cancer type presents a broad spectrum of tobacco smoking mutagenesis. Due to
the strong correlation between gender and tobacco smoking mutational signature weights as well as smoking history (p=1x10-4, Fig-
ure S5B), we further limit this analysis to the 71 cancers from male patients (which are the majority of the smokers) in order to
decouple these variables. Additionally, we computed the Spearman’s rank correlation between smoking signature weights and
normalized enrichment scores from mRNA-based ssGSEA using the MSigDB HALLMARK gene sets. We used the 71 male LUAD
and 86 male LSCC for this analysis in order to prevent tissue-driven biases at low tobacco smoking mutation levels from other cancer
types that typically have relatively low levels of tobacco smoking mutagenesis.
Lasso regression analysis
Acetylation sites with detection rates of at least 80% across the entire cohort were collected, and the abundances of these sites were
imputed using the ‘‘impute.knn’’ function from the R package ‘‘impute’’ using the default parameters (k = 10, rowmax = 0.5, colmax =
0.8, maxp = 1500, rng.seed = 362436069). For the protein abundance of histones and histone regulators, the abundance of proteins
mapping to multiple RefSeq IDs were averaged. Within each cluster, we tested the association between the abundance of histone
acetylation sites and the abundance of histone acetyltransferases (HATs), histone deacetylases (HDACs) and bromodomain proteins
(BRDs) using lasso regression. In particular, each histone acetylation site was treated as the outcome variable with the HATs/HDACs/
BRDs protein treated as covariates. We split the data so that 80% (training set) are randomly designated for ﬁtting the lasso regres-
sion model and the other 20% (testing set) are used to test its performance. Lasso uses a regularization parameter, l, to control the
weight of the L1 norm in the Lasso cost function. Within the training set, we identiﬁed the site-speciﬁc optimal l value with 10-fold
cross-validation that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) for each acetylation site in each bootstrapping. We also calculated the
lasso coefﬁcient for each outcome-covariate pairs, where a non-zero lasso coefﬁcient indicated that the covariate would have a sig-
niﬁcant effect on the outcome. We predicted the abundance of each acetylation site in the testing set using the lasso coefﬁcient
generated from the training set and calculated the test MSE between predicted value and actual value. We bootstrapped these pro-
cesses for 100 replications in order to minimize any bias introduced by the random sampling. We reported average lasso coefﬁcients
(Table S5) from 100 bootstrapping of lasso regression to improve precision in variable selections. To demonstrate the reproducibility
and stability of the variable selections, we computed the mean and standard error of the test MSE across all histone acetylation sites
separately from 25, 50, 75 and 100 replications. The test MSE was generated from the best model selected using optimal l in each
bootstrapping of lasso regression. The mean and standard error of the MSE were averaged across all histone acetylation sites, re-
sulting in values of 1.14±0.78, 1.14±0.79, 1.15±0.79, 1.15±0.79, across 25, 50, 75, and 100 replications, respectively. We also re-
ported site-speciﬁc mean MSE along with their standard errors in Table S5. This demonstrates that the mean MSE is very stable
across different numbers of replications.

Differential acetylation of histone sites across dendro groups
The results from the global differential expression analysis (see differential expression) were used to subset histone genes by map-
ping RefSeq IDs to HGNC IDs. Sites with q < 0.1 were considered signiﬁcant.
Transcriptional signature analysis
Across all samples, the correlation between the ssGSEA scores of HALLMARK pathways and histone acetylation sites was assessed
using the imputed PTM data. For each histone acetylsite-pathway pair, we computed the Spearman correlation and p value. P values
were then adjusted to FDR values across the 50 HALLMARK pathways for each histone acetylation site tested.
Acetylation-phosphorylation crosstalk analysis
For each acetylation site detected, phosphorylation sites with the same RefSeq protein ID, and within 5 amino acid residues of the
acetylation site, were collected. For each cluster and across all samples, Spearman correlations were then computed for each adja-
cent acetylation sitephosphorylation site pair and p-values were adjusted to FDR values across all site pairs tested.
Histone acetylation across immune groups
The imputed acetylation data was ﬁltered for histone acetylation sites by mapping RefSeq IDs to HGNC IDs. The abundance of these
sites was then compared between the Immune-cool samples versus all other samples using a two-sided Wilcoxon test. P values were
corrected to FDR values, and sites with FDR < 0.1 were considered signiﬁcant.
SignatureAnalyzer
Efﬁcient algorithms have been developed by the machine learning community for matrix factorization with a strict non-negativity
requisite. One of the beneﬁts of using a non-negative factorization method is that it typically yields sparse solutions (i.e., fewer ‘sig-
natures’ are used to represent the data of one tumor), which typically have clear interpretations. Non-negative Matrix Factorization
(NMF) is an algorithm that computes a low-rank factorization of an input matrix V into two matrices W and H, such that V  W * H and
all elements of V, W, and H are strictly non-negative. The W matrix is a N-by-k matrix, where N is the number of features, and k is the
number of signatures. This matrix provides the weights for each feature in each of the signatures, and thus the columns of W are
called the signatures. The H matrix is a k-by-S matrix, where k, as before, is the number of signatures, and S is the number of samples.
This matrix provides the contribution of each signature in each sample. This matrix can be normalized for downstream analyses such
that the sum of contributions for a given sample sums to 1.
NMF was originally developed for analysis of image data171 but has a long history of use in biology to deconvolute expression
data172 and identify ‘meta genes,’ which we now call ‘signatures’. NMF was later used to deconvolute mutation proﬁles and identify
mutational signatures that were then matched with different mutational processes.44 The use of non-negative methods in the muta-
tion space is intuitive since both mutation counts, and mutation rates, are positive numbers, and the results have a clear interpretation
(i.e., the number of mutations a particular process contributes to each tumor). In these cases, the input V is a matrix of transcriptomic
or genomic features by samples, respectively. The derived W matrix represents signatures and their feature weights, while the H ma-
trix represents signature contributions to each sample’s observed phenotype.
A common challenge with NMF is the tendency to overﬁt the data given an increasing input number of signatures, K.
SignatureAnalyzer uses a Bayesian version of NMF, called automatic relevance determination-NMF (ARD-NMF),160 which assumes
a sparse prior on both the W and H matrices and searches for a maximum posterior solution. It initializes the analysis with a large
number of signatures (K0 = 50 for multi-omic NMF and K0 = # features for mutational signatures) and by virtue of the priors, signatures
unnecessary to explain the data have their weights driven to zero in the respective columns/rows of the W/H matrix. We run
SignatureAnalyzer multiple times (n=100) and obtain a distribution on the number of signatures (as it converges to different local max-
ima of the posterior distribution). We select k as the mode of the distribution and the W and H matrices that correspond to the highest
posterior solution with that value of k. This allows highly interpretable and sparse representations for both signature proﬁles and at-
tributions that strike a balance between data ﬁtting and model complexity.160 This method, among others, has been widely applied to
analyze mutational signatures and expression signatures for molecular data (mRNA, protein, etc).43,44,164,172–174
In this study, we apply SignatureAnalyzer to somatic mutation data to extract mutational signatures, and to the multi-omic pheno-
types to identify patterns of regulation across cancer. Mutation counts are by nature non-negative, and we can adjust the multi-omic
phenotype matrix by splitting each gene, protein, and phosphorylation feature into a positive and negative row in the matrix. We
negate the negative row such that all values are non-negative. This creates a less dense matrix since every feature is replaced
with two values, one of which is zero. The sparse matrix can be easily handled by NMF. At the end, the resulting signatures also
contain rows corresponding to positive and negative values, and therefore the possibility of upregulation and downregulation is main-
tained. Since mutations can be represented as count data generated by independent, low frequency events (with the exception of
clustered mutations such as APOBEC generated kataegis), we can approximate these mutation counts with a Poisson distribution.
For multi-omic data, the Poisson assumptions do not hold, and we model the likelihood of the zero-centered data using a truncated
(half) Gaussian distribution (Figure S1C).
In order to reward sparsity of the resulting W and H matrices, we apply an exponential prior to all entries in the W and H matrices for
mutational signatures, and a half-normal prior to all entries for the multi-omic signatures. Applying an exponential prior to the weights

in the W and H matrices is equivalent to adding an L1 regularization term to the cost function being optimized. To illustrate this point,
consider the pdf of the exponential distribution:
fðx; lÞ = le lx
In our cases, x represents an entry in the W and H matrices of the factorization. As SignatureAnalyzer follows the procedure in Tan
et al.160 to minimize a cost function given by the negative log posterior, this term is incorporated as follows:
 log fðxÞ =  log l + lx
Since -logl is constant with respect to the entries of the W and H matrix, the choice of an exponential prior effectively puts an L1
penalty on the value of x with regularization strength determined by l. Note that L1 penalty uses the absolute value of x, ie. |x|, but
since all values in the matrices are positive, we do not need the absolute value. We can work out similar math for the half normal case
to see that this is indeed equivalent to L2 regularization.

Mutational signature discovery requires deconvolution of somatic mutation counts, stratiﬁed by mutation sequence context, into a
set of characteristic patterns (signatures) and inferring their activity across each of the samples in the study. The common stratiﬁca-
tion of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) is based on the six base substitutions (C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and T>G) within
the trinucleotide sequence context, which includes the bases located at positions immediately adjacent to the 5’ and 3’ directions
relative to the mutated base. Thus, each of the six base substitutions have 16 possible combinations of neighboring bases, yielding
96 possible mutation types (or sequence contexts). The input matrix for mutational signature analysis is a 96 x S matrix, where S is the
number of samples, and each element xij represents the number of observed mutations of type i in sample j. Using this matrix, we
identiﬁed the mutational signatures and their contributions to each sample. This type of analysis has been used in numerous publi-
cations starting with Lawrence et al.144 and most recently applied across cancer in the TCGA/ICGC Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole
Genomes (PCAWG) project.44 We compared the signatures that we obtained to the ones reported in the COSMIC database and
PCAWG paper in order to connect them to their proposed etiologies. We then used these signatures to classify tumors with mismatch
repair deﬁciency and homologous recombination deﬁciency based on the activity of mutational signatures associated with these
repair defects across all of our samples.

To provide additional internal validation for the robustness of the subtypes and test the effect of having fewer samples, we ran
SignatureAnalyzer on downsampled cohorts of sizes N=100, 200,...1000 from our full Pan-Cancer cohort (n=1110). We performed
30 random downsamplings without replacement per value of N (‘‘runs’’), and within each run, we performed 20 independent Bayesian
NMF iterations (each initialized with a unique random seed). We then matched the signatures derived in each downsampling run with
the signatures obtained when analyzing the full cohort using cosine similarity with a threshold of 0.8. The percent of downsamples out
of 30 runs in which a particular signature was identiﬁed is plotted in the heatmap below. As shown in the heatmap, even when
downsampling to 800 samples (72% of the dataset), 24 signatures are seen in >1/2 of the runs. Moreover, signatures S24 and S7
(which are the dominant signature in a large number of samples; 71 and 73 samples, respectively) are detected even in very small
subsampled cohorts, making them more robust signatures. On the other hand, signatures S27 and S31 are less robust (i.e.,
‘‘weaker’’) and are only found in a minority of downsampling runs, even with large cohort sizes (800-1000).
Further exploring the effect of cohort composition on our signatures, and speciﬁcally our external MB cohort, we investigated how
the inclusion of MB impacts our signatures. To this end, we reran SignatureAnalyzer excluding (i) the MB cohort, (ii) the GBM cohort,
and (iii) both MB and GBM cohorts. We provide a heatmap showing the cosine similarities between the signatures derived from each
of these cohort exclusion runs, and the signatures derived in the full dataset, colored by cosine similarity. The boxplot to the right of
the heatmap indicates the number of samples assigned to each signature per decomposition (assignment based on maximally
contributing signature). First, we ﬁnd that Signature 31 is not derived in each of these decompositions, consistent with downsampling
analyses indicating its lower robustness (‘weakness’). Next, we see that upon removal of the MB cohort, all signatures with the
exception of S14 are derived with >0.85 cosine similarity to the full cohort signatures, suggesting MB itself does not yield a signiﬁcant
effect on the signatures. S14 is not derived when MB is excluded, but this signature is the second ‘‘weakest’’ signature derived from
downsampling and is mixed across multiple cohorts (maximal contributions to S14 are with 47% from UCEC, 29% from CCRCC, and
then 12% from MB) deﬁned by strong transcriptomic activation of EMT (Table S2). Interestingly, we ﬁnd Signatures 9 and 20 are not
derived when excluding GBM and both brain cohorts (MB and GBM). S20 is a weaker signature with a 56% dominance of GBM. S9,
however, is a stronger signature split between MB (34.29%) and GBM (65.71%), deﬁned by downregulation of MYC with strong
positive transcriptomic and negative phosphorylation effects. This suggests that S9 is a tissue-speciﬁc signature of biologic interest
rather than a speciﬁc batch effect. S7 (immune upregulation) and S22 (myogenesis/adipogenesis in phosphoproteome) are examples
of signatures without any MB samples. Notably, for these two signatures, 1 GBM patient (out of 73 in S7) maximally maps to S7 and 1
GBM patient (out of 39 in S22) maximally maps to S22 (Table S2). We believe more samples would be required to deﬁnitively suggest
if these signatures are truly devoid of MB speciﬁc samples, or lack biological pathways associated with brain tissue.

PTM dedicated tools
To explore and interpret site speciﬁc PTM data, we developed and applied PTM-tailored tools. We provide here a short description
of each:
CLUMPS-PTM
PTMs play key roles in numerous cell signaling processes in the context of cancer. Previous studies have shown that close proximity
of PTM sites, either in linear sequence or on the 3D protein structure, increases the chance of crosstalk among such sites and may
have functional outcomes.175–177 Despite advances in LC-MS increasing the throughput of PTM quantiﬁcation, identifying these
functionally relevant PTMs and protein domains remains a challenge. We developed CLUMPS-PTM, an algorithm for spatial clus-
tering of PTMs, to identify clusters of correlated PTMs in protein structures that likely reﬂect stronger, mutually dependent signaling
effects (Figure S2D). CLUMPS-PTM is built on a previous tool we developed, CLUMPS,168 initially designed to identify novel driver
mutations based on clustering of missense mutations in 3D protein structures. CLUMPS-PTM was developed for phosphorylation
and acetylation events, but is ﬂexibly designed to incorporate any PTM modiﬁcations (such as ubiquitination, etc.). We developed
pipelines (compatible with RefSeq and GENCODE isoforms) to map over 14K phospho-sites and 13K acetyl-sites detected in the
CPTAC dataset to protein data bank (PDB) ﬁles (Figure S2E). We expand this to the predicted AlphaFold proteome and recover
an additional 12K phospho-sites and 10K acetyl-sites exceeding model conﬁdence (pLDDT) of 70%. Consistent with previous
research,178 phosphosites are found on residues with lower AlphaFold prediction conﬁdence than acetylsites due to their abundance
in unstructured domains (p<1e–4). CLUMPS-PTM may be run on either a database of PTM sites or differential expression results. This
tool has been applied to multiple CPTAC projects7 in addition to the Pan-Cancer context to propose functional domains for 1) tumor
vs. normal analyses, 2) immune inﬁltration / subtyping, 3) phospho/acetyl co-clustering, and 4) tumor-speciﬁc subtyping. Overall,
CLUMPS-PTM is an open-source tool that allows near proteome-wide spatial analysis with the growing availability of PTM data.
We anticipate that it will be useful to the broader proteomic community for the discovery of novel targets and generation of insights
into functional mechanisms (Figure S2F; STAR Methods).
The Kinase Library
The Kinase Library experimentally characterizes the substrate sequence speciﬁcity of over 300 protein Ser/Thr kinases.34 This data-
set is then used to computationally identify the most likely protein kinases for differentially phosphorylated sites and predict kinases
that are up- or downregulated (STAR Methods). Moreover, this library also tests the change of sequence speciﬁcity when a close
proximity acetylation is added and enables the study of crosstalk and its effect on kinase regulation. In addition, this method was
also applied in our companion Driver paper154 to characterize the activity states of kinases under different oncogenic driver events.
CausalPath
CausalPath35 aims to identify potential cause–effect relationships between the observed omic changes (proteomic and transcrip-
tomic) using a variety of prior information, such as (i) the regulation of protein modiﬁcation (phosphorylation, acetylation, and methyl-
ation), (ii) the effect of the modiﬁed protein site on the protein activity, and (iii) the regulation of gene expression. In general, the method
has two essential steps. In step 1, CausalPath works on the Pathway Commons database to identify which protein activities control
which measurable omic features, and in what direction. In step 2, CausalPath uses a logical equation to detect the subset of the
extracted priors that can causally explain the observed coordinated changes. The logical function links omic changes to protein ac-
tivities and checks if the observed downstream changes are in the expected direction. On top of these steps, CausalPath runs enrich-
ment analysis to detect the proteins on the result network with a signiﬁcant number of affected downstream targets. CausalPath was
previously used in a myriad of analyses and diseases such as: platelet activation,179,180 lung squamous cell carcinoma,7 glioblas-
toma,4 acute myeloid leukemia,181 pediatric high-grade glioma,182 cell line drug treatments,183 and breast cancer.184,185
PTM-SEA
PTM-SEA, similar to GSEA, is a pathway enrichment approach that identiﬁes activated or deactivated regulators like kinases or phos-
phatases, using an enrichment of experimentally validated substrates.36 Most proteomic tools are performed on a gene-centric level
and collapse multiple sites to their average or dominant site; this process causes loss of important information encoded at the site-
speciﬁc level. The tool is based on the PTMsigDB curated database with a large advantage of site-speciﬁc annotation and direction-
ality of the PTM regulation.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The process of RNAseq data processing and quantiﬁcation, as well as proteome quantiﬁcation, has been outlined in the sections
titled "RNAseq data processing and quantiﬁcation" and "Proteomics data processing," respectively. The statistical analysis meth-
odology and its corresponding details can be found both within the main text and in the relevant sections of the STAR Methods.

(A) Stacked barplot of patient-wise assigned maximally weighted signature colored by cohort (left). Stacked bar plot shows the breakdown, normalized by the
number of patients maximally assigned to a given signature (right).
(B) Multi-omic hierarchical clustering of tumors based on multi-omic NMF signature weights. Heatmap represents the pairwise cosine similarity between tumors.
Non-overlapping clusters, yellow boxes. Top track shows the cluster assignments. Dendrogram is colored based on the second level of the tree.
(C) Distribution of the fraction of a sample’s NMF signature weights accounted for by the maximally contributing signature (top, left); distribution of the number of
signatures required to explain at least 90% of a sample’s signature weights (top, right); distribution of the difference between the fraction of a sample’s NMF
signature weights accounted for by the maximally contributing signature and the second strongest signature (bottom).
(D) Schematic workﬂow of the newly developed CLUMPS-PTM algorithm.
(E) Sankey plot showing the mapping between protein sequences to PDB structures. Protein sequences were aligned to the UniProtKB database (using BLASTP+
hits), then ﬁltered to those with matching well-annotated proteins identiﬁed using the structure integration with function, taxonomy and sequence (SIFTS) method.
These were then mapped to available crystal structures with at least 3 modiﬁed PTM sites across the entire CPTAC dataset (upper left). Sankey plot of all PTM
sites in the CPTAC dataset, splitting to those with accession-numbers mapped to available Uniprot input proteins, and then to proteins with available PDB
structures veriﬁed in the SIFTS database (lower left). Violin plots of the BLASTP+ relative identity score to the Uniprot database for proteins and PTM sites that
map or do not map to PDB structures (right).
(F) Stacked bar plots summarizing CLUMPS-PTM results showing the total number of proteins tested based on group-speciﬁc differential expression test and
direction (top). Stacks show the number of structures that are nominally signiﬁcant (p < 0.1; yellow) and pass multiple hypothesis testing (FDR < 0.1; red) for
acetylome, phosphoproteome, and combined samplers. CLUMPS-PTM phosphorylation and acetylation hits (q value < 0.1) for the left (L) vs. right (R) top split of
the pan-cancer dendrogram (bottom). The ﬁrst heatmap (on the left) indicates the number of distinct peptides found in each cohort that contributed to the
differential PTM cluster. The x axis represents the cohort. The second heatmap (on the right) expands on each CLUMPS-PTM hit and shows the log-fold change
between the left vs. right branches of the top split in the dendrogram for each represented peptide. Blue indicates phosphorylated clustered sites.

Figure S5. Histone analysis, related to Figure 5
(A) Correlation matrix showing the correlations between mean acetylation of H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Asterisks denote correlations with p < 0.05.
(B) Violin plot showing the distribution of tobacco smoking mutational signature contributions (log10-scale) for males and females in LSCC and LUAD. Shapes
indicate the cancer type—LUAD (circle) and LSCC (triangle). p value (1 3 104) from Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
(C) Dot plot showing signiﬁcant Spearman correlations (q % 0.1) across male LUAD patients (n = 71) between histone acetylation levels and tobacco smoking
mutational signature contributions.
(D) Dot plot showing signiﬁcant Spearman correlations (q % 0.1) across male LUAD patients (n = 71) between deacetylases phosphorylation levels and tobacco
smoking mutational signature contributions.
(E) Dot plot illustrating signiﬁcant Spearman correlations (q % 0.1, |rho| > 0.15) across male LSCC and male LUAD patients (n = 157) between tobacco smoking
mutational signature contributions and the mRNA ssGSEA scores for the MSigDB hallmark genesets.
(F) Scatter plot showing the positive correlation (rho = 0.332) between tobacco smoking mutational signature contributions and the ssGSEA score for the G2/M
checkpoint (left) and MTORC1 (right) hallmark geneset in male LUAD and male LSCC tumors (n = 157).

Figure S6. The Kinase Library, related to Figure 6
(A) Boxplots showing The Kinase Library normalized intensity ratios of 207 Ser/Thr kinases for unmodiﬁed, trimethylated, and acetylated lysines, across 10
positions (5 to +5) around the central phosphoacceptor site.
(B) Heatmap showing The Kinase Library normalized intensity ratios between trimethylated lysine and unmodiﬁed lysine across the 207 Ser/Thr kinases. Kinases
are colored according to their phylogenetic groups.117
(C) Heatmap showing the expression levels of acetylated K23 and phosphorylated S28 on H3F3A across 41 patients in cluster #8. Samples are sorted based on
hierarchical clustering of their correlations.
(D) Heatmap showing the expression levels of acetylated K1378 and phosphorylated S1375 on RSF1 across the 89 LUAD and LUSC patients with acetylation and
phosphorylation data. Samples are sorted based on hierarchical clustering of their correlations.
