Alterations in DNA repair pathways are common in tumors 
and can result in characteristic mutational signatures; however, 
a specific mutational signature associated with somatic 
alterations in the nucleotide- excision repair (NER) pathway 
has not yet been identified. Here we examine the mutational 
processes operating in urothelial cancer, a tumor type in which 
the core NER gene ERCC2 is significantly mutated. Analysis 
of three independent urothelial tumor cohorts demonstrates 
a strong association between somatic ERCC2 mutations and 
the activity of a mutational signature characterized by a broad 
spectrum of base changes. In addition, we note an association 
between the activity of this signature and smoking that is 
independent of ERCC2 mutation status, providing genomic 
evidence of tobacco-related mutagenesis in urothelial cancer. 
Together, these analyses identify an NER-related mutational 
signature and highlight the related roles of DNA damage and 
subsequent DNA repair in shaping tumor mutational landscape.
Cells are continually exposed to both exogenous and endogenous 
sources of DNA damage, and multiple DNA repair pathways have 
evolved to repair a variety of DNA lesions. However, many tumors 
are functionally deficient in one or more DNA repair pathways1–3. 
The somatic mutational landscape of tumor cells reflects the 
cumulative activity of discrete mutational processes operating 
across the lifetime of each cell, and loss of DNA repair fidelity can 
augment the effect of these processes and lead to increased somatic 
mutation rates.
Mutational signatures are patterns of base changes associated with 
specific mutational processes operating in tumor cells. Recently, 
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods have been applied 
to discover and characterize mutational signatures across multiple 
tumor types4,5. Dozens of mutational signatures have been identified, 
including several that have been linked to specific DNA-damaging 
agents or DNA repair defects6. Mutational signatures associated with 
deficiencies in the homologous recombination and mismatch-repair 
pathways have recently been characterized, but mutational signatures 
associated with deficiencies in other DNA repair pathways have not 
yet been identified.
The NER pathway is a highly conserved DNA repair pathway that 
removes bulky intrastrand adducts created by agents such as UV 
radiation and certain chemicals, including several commonly used 
chemotherapy agents7. Somatic mutations in NER pathway genes 
occur sporadically across cancer types, but recurrent mutations in 
specific NER pathway genes are uncommon8. One notable exception 
is the ERCC2 gene, which encodes a DNA helicase that has a cen­
tral role in the NER pathway, unwinding the DNA duplex adjacent 
to a site of damage9,10. Recurrent somatic ERCC2 mutations have 
been identified in 6–18% of urothelial tumors in studies published by 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and others11–14.
Tumors of the urothelial tract and bladder account for nearly 75,000 
new cancer cases each year in the United States and are associated with 
exposure to tobacco, chemicals, and certain infectious agents15,16. 
Many of these carcinogens are known to damage DNA through the 
formation of bulky intrastrand adducts17–19, and several studies 
have demonstrated an increased risk of bladder cancer in individuals 
with polymorphisms in ERCC2 or other NER pathway genes20,21. 
Similar to other carcinogen-associated tumors, most urothelial 
tumors have a high somatic mutation burden. ERCC2-mutated 
urothelial tumors have a higher overall mutation burden than tumors 
with wild-type ERCC2 but have a lower fraction of C>G mutations11. 
Despite the known association between smoking and urothelial 
cancer, a tobacco-associated mutational signature has not been 
identified in urothelial tumors.
To more fully characterize the mutational processes operating in 
urothelial cancer, we performed mutational signature analysis in 
three independent urothelial tumor cohorts. Our analysis identi­
fied four operating mutational signatures, including one signature 
for which an etiology had not previously been described. Unbiased 
enrichment analysis identified ERCC2 as the gene that, when mutated, 
was most strongly associated with the activity of this signature in all 
three cohorts. Furthermore, we find that activity of the signature is 
associated with smoking history, making this the first description of 
Somatic ERCC2 mutations are associated with a distinct 
genomic signature in urothelial tumors

a tobacco-related mutational signature in urothelial cancer. Together, 
these findings identify the first NER-related mutational signature, to 
our knowledge, and underscore the importance of both exposure to 
DNA-damaging agents and operation of DNA repair pathways in the 
activities of mutational signatures.
RESULTS
Mutational signature analysis of the TCGA-130 cohort
To understand the DNA damage and repair processes operating in 
urothelial tumors, we performed mutational signature analysis of 130 
muscle-invasive urothelial tumors from the TCGA-130 cohort (Fig. 1a 
and Supplementary Table 1). We applied a Bayesian variant of the NMF 
algorithm to mutation counts, stratified by 96 trinucleotide mutational 
contexts, to infer (i) the number of operating mutational processes, 
(ii) their signatures (96 normalized weights per process), and (iii) the 
activity of each signature in every tumor (the estimated number of 
mutations associated with each signature) (Online Methods)5,22.
Our analysis identified four independent mutational signatures in 
the TCGA-130 cohort (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), 
and although our analysis methods are not identical to those applied 
by the Sanger Institute our signatures matched four of the previously 
identified Sanger signatures (cosine similarities between 0.86 and 0.95), 
which are described in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer 
(COSMIC) database (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary 
Table 4)4. Two of the signatures, characterized by C>T transitions 
and C>G transversions at TC[A/T] motifs (where the mutated C is 
preceded by T and followed by A or T), occur in multiple tumor types 
and are attributed to APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis (denoted as 
APOBEC1 and APOBEC2 in Fig. 1b and corresponding to COSMIC 
signatures 13 and 2, respectively)4,23,24. A third signature, characterized 
by C>T transitions at CpG dinucleotides, is found in all tumor 
types and is thought to result from age-related accumulation of 
5-methylcytosine deamination events (C>T CpG in Fig. 1b; COSMIC 
signature 1). Finally, a fourth signature was identified that closely 
resembles COSMIC signature 5 (cosine similarity of 0.90; denoted as 
signature 5* in Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). COSMIC signature 
5 is characterized by a broad spectrum of base changes and is present 
in all tumor types; an etiology has not yet been described.
Signature 5* activity is associated with ERCC2 mutations
To further characterize signature 5*, we performed signature 
enrichment analysis to identify genes that, when mutated, were 
associated with increased activity of signa­
ture 5* (Online Methods). For each of the 
283 genes that had a non-silent mutation 
in >5% of samples across the TCGA-130 
cohort, we compared the activity of signa­
ture 5* in tumors that carried a non-silent 
mutation in the gene and tumors that did 
not. To ensure that increased signature 5* 
activity did not reflect an increase in over­
all mutation burden, we assessed the sig­
nificance level using a permutation-based method that controls 
the overall mutation burden in each sample (Online Methods). 
ERCC2 was the only significant gene (Benjamini–Hochberg 
false discovery rate (FDR) q = 8.6 × 10−3, P = 3 × 10−5; Fig. 2 
and Supplementary Fig. 2). Overall, 16 of the 130 tumors had 
a non-silent ERCC2 mutation, and these tumors had a median of 135 
signature 5* mutations as compared to 40 in tumors without a non-
silent ERCC2 mutation (an increase of 95 mutations in the median 
activity of signature 5*) (Fig. 3a).
Validation in two independent cohorts of urothelial tumors
To validate these findings, we performed similar analyses on two 
independent cohorts. The first cohort included 50 muscle-invasive 
urothelial tumors recently analyzed by Van Allen et al. (DFCI/MSK-50 
cohort) (Supplementary Table 1)12. This cohort comprises patients 
treated with neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy and con­
tains an equal number of cisplatin responders and non-responders. 
Bayesian NMF analysis yielded four mutational signatures that 
closely resembled the signatures identified in the TCGA-130 cohort 
(cosine similarities of 0.93–0.99; Supplementary Figs. 1 and 3, and 
Supplementary Table 5). Repeating the gene mutation enrichment 
analysis for signature 5* activity identified three significant genes 
(q ≤ 0.1), with ERCC2 being the most significant (q = 0.042, 
P = 1.9 × 10−4; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4). 
Nine of the 50 tumors had a non-silent mutation in ERCC2, and 
these tumors had a median of 220 signature 5* mutations as compared 
to 32 in tumors lacking non-silent ERCC2 mutations (an increase 
of 188).
The second validation cohort comprised 99 urothelial tumors (62 
muscle invasive and 37 non muscle invasive) recently reported by 
Guo et al. (BGI-99) (Supplementary Table 1)13. As in the previ­
ous two cohorts, our analysis identified four mutational signatures 
(Supplementary Fig. 5). The first two resembled the two APOBEC-
associated signatures (cosine similarities of 0.96 and 0.80 with 
COSMIC signatures 2 and 13, respectively), but the third signature 
was not observed in the previous cohorts and was dominated by 
T>A mutations. This signature is most similar to COSMIC signa­
ture 22 (cosine similarity of 0.96) and has been linked to exposure to 
aristolochic acid, an ingredient in some food supplements that are 
most commonly used in Asian countries25. Indeed, consumption of 
aristolochic acid has been associated with increased risk of urothelial 
cancers26–28. The fourth signature in this cohort seems to be a

superposition of the two other signatures identified in the previous 
cohorts, C>T CpG and signature 5*, with the lack of separation 
possibly due to insufficient resolution given the lower overall 
mutation burden in this cohort. As in the other cohorts, tumors with 
a non-silent mutation in ERCC2 had increased activity of the fourth 
signature, which includes signature 5* (ten tumors with a non-silent 
ERCC2 mutation and a median increase of 55 mutations per sample; 
q = 0.012, P = 2.5 × 10−4; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4).
Finally, we repeated the analysis for all 279 tumors across the three 
cohorts (COMB-279 cohort). Among the 35 tumors with a non-silent 
ERCC2 mutation, the median signature 5* activity was increased by 
91 mutations in comparison to tumors with wild-type ERCC2 (124 
versus 33), providing the strongest statistical evidence for the asso­
ciation between ERCC2 mutation and signature 5* activity (q = 1.6 
× 10−3, P = 1.0 × 10−5; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4). 
Together, these data strongly suggest that, although signature 5* 
activity is present in tumors both wild type and mutant for ERCC2, 
somatic ERCC2 mutations are associated with a significant increase 
in signature 5* activity.
To further characterize the association between ERCC2 muta­
tional status and signature 5* activity, we performed unsupervised 
clustering of tumors based on signature 5* activity (in 96 trinu­
cleotide mutational contexts). The combined cohort (COMB-279) 
segregated into two clusters of 222 and 57 tumors, with 25 of the 
35 ERCC2-mutated tumors in the second cluster (P = 1.7 × 10−12, 
Fisher’s exact test; Supplementary Fig. 6a). Repeating the 
analysis using the 242 muscle-invasive tumors across cohorts 
(COMB-MI-242) yielded a more significant association between 
clusters and ERCC2 mutations (P = 4.4 × 10−14; Supplementary 
Fig. 6b). Although ERCC2 mutations are associated with higher 
overall mutation burden11–13, segregation was not driven by 
this higher burden, as ERCC2-mutated tumors segregated 
less strongly when clustering was performed using the total 
number of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) (PCOMB-279 = 0.1 and 
PCOMB-MI-242 = 0.008; Supplementary Fig. 6c,d).
All but one of the 35 non-silent ERCC2 mutations across the cohorts 
were missense mutations, and most of these (25 of 34) mapped within 
or adjacent to (±10 amino acids) the conserved helicase motifs, sug­
gesting that the mutations may have an impact on ERCC2 protein 
function (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Supporting this hypothesis, the 
mutations mapping to helicase motifs were associated with higher 
signature 5* activity than mutations mapping elsewhere in the pro­
tein (median number of signature 5* mutations of 134 versus 96, 
P = 0.037). To assess the spatial relationship of protein residues 
affected by mutation, we used CLUMPS, a novel algorithm for assess­
ing spatial clustering of altered residues within three-dimensional 
protein structures, and found that the residues corresponding to 
ERCC2 mutations were significantly clustered (P = 0.0026), further 
suggesting that the mutations have a functional role (Online Methods 
and Supplementary Fig. 7b)29.
For each of the three cohorts analyzed here, ERCC2-mutated tumors 
have been shown to have greater overall mutation burden than tumors 
with wild-type ERCC2 (refs. 11–13). We asked whether this higher 
burden was due solely to increased signature 5* activity or whether 
the activities of other signatures were also increased. Indeed, activity 
of the APOBEC2 signature was also higher in ERCC2-mutated tumors 
than in tumors with wild-type ERCC2 in the TCGA-130 cohort (39 
versus 12 APOBEC2 mutations, P = 0.004; Fig. 3b); however, unlike 
the association between ERCC2 mutation and signature 5*, the asso­
ciation of ERCC2 mutation with the APOBEC2 signature was not

significant after correcting for multiple testing (q = 0.54). A similar 
association between ERCC2 mutation and the APOBEC2 signature 
was seen in the other two cohorts, but this association was only statis­
tically significant in the combined (COMB-279) cohort (q = 0.0016; 
Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). There was no increase in activity of the 
APOBEC1 (78 versus 103 mutations in TCGA-130, P = 0.99) or C>T 
CpG (0 versus 13, P = 0.91) signature in tumors with mutant versus 
wild-type ERCC2 in any of the cohorts (Fig. 3b and Supplementary 
Fig. 8). These results demonstrate that the higher overall mutation 
burden in ERCC2-mutated tumors is due primarily to increased 
activity of signature 5*, with an additional smaller contribution from 
the APOBEC2 signature.
Non-ERCC2 NER mutations and signature 5* activity
Despite the strong association between signature 5* activity and 
ERCC2 mutational status, several tumors with high signature 5* activ­
ity lacked a somatic ERCC2 mutation. In these cases, we hypoth­
esized that other somatic or germline NER pathway alterations might 
contribute to signature 5* activity. Somatic mutations in other NER 
pathway genes are less common in urothelial tumors, and there was 
no statistically significant association between signature 5* activity 
and mutations in any individual NER gene or the pathway as a whole 
(when ERCC2 was excluded) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 10). 
However, anecdotally, of the 20 tumors with wild-type ERCC2 
showing the highest signature 5* activity, 6 had a mutation in a differ­
ent gene in the NER pathway. In addition, germline data were avail­
able for the TCGA-130 and DFCI/MSK-50 cohorts, and there was 
a trend toward an association between rare (<2% frequency in the 
cohorts) NER germline variants and signature 5* activity in cases 
with wild-type ERCC2 (19 of the 32 tumors with wild-type ERCC2 
showing the highest signature 5* activity had an NER germline 
variant in comparison to only 54 of the remaining 123 tumors with 
wild-type ERCC2, P = 0.086; Online Methods and Supplementary 
Fig. 11a). Moreover, four specific NER germline alleles were enriched 
(q < 0.1) in tumors with wild-type ERCC2 showing high signature 
5* activity, and three of the four are predicted to be functionally 
deleterious (Supplementary Fig. 11b)30. However, additional studies 
in larger cohorts will be needed to further characterize the potential 
contribution of non-ERCC2 somatic and germline NER alterations 
to signature 5* activity.
Smoking is associated with signature 5* activity
Given the known association between smoking and urothelial can­
cer, we attempted to identify evidence of tobacco exposure in the 
mutational signatures of urothelial tumors. Data on smoking status 
were available for the TCGA-130 and DFCI/MSK-50 cohorts, and 
these were therefore analyzed together. There was no difference in 
overall mutation burden in tumors from patients with any smoking 
history (‘smokers’) versus those with no smoking history (‘non­
smokers’) (P = 0.27, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 5a). However, 
the activity of signature 5* was significantly higher in smokers than 
in nonsmokers (median number of signature 5* mutations, 49 ver­
sus 33, P = 0.009; Fig. 5b), although the effect size for smoking was 
modest when compared to that of an ERCC2 mutation (Fig. 5c). 
There were no differences in signature 5* activity between current 
and former smokers; however, there was a correlation between 
smoking intensity (pack-years) and signature 5* activity in ERCC2-
mutated cases (P = 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 12). There were no 
differences in other mutational signatures in smokers versus non­
smokers (Supplementary Fig. 13).
Although an association between smoking and COSMIC signa­
ture 5 has previously been noted in lung adenocarcinoma, a different 
and more common smoking-related signature characterized by fre­
quent C>A transversions (COSMIC signature 4) was not identified

in any of the urothelial cohorts analyzed here4,31. Given the asso­
ciation of signature 5* activity with smoking, we explored whether 
COSMIC signature 4 contributes to signature 5*, with these proc­
esses not separated by NMF owing to insufficient power. To test this 
hypothesis, we attempted to separate signature 5* mutations into 
contributions from COSMIC signatures 4 and 5 (Online Methods). 
This analysis confirmed the high similarity of signature 5* and 
COSMIC signature 5 and demonstrated that the smoking-related 
difference in signature 5* activity is indeed driven by a difference 
in activity of COSMIC signature 5 and not COSMIC signature 4 
(Supplementary Fig. 14).
Several mutational signatures exhibit an asymmetric pattern of 
mutations on the transcribed versus non-transcribed DNA strand, a 
phenomenon that is attributed to the increased rate of high-fidelity 
repair of the transcribed strand by the transcription-coupled repair 
subpathway of NER7,32–35. To determine whether signature 5* exhibits 
transcriptional strand bias, we repeated the Bayesian NMF analysis 
using 192 mutational contexts (instead of 96) to consider mutations 
on the transcribed and non-transcribed strands independently 
(Online Methods and Supplementary Fig. 15). Signature 5* exhibited 
strand asymmetry in several contexts, including a bias for T>C transi­
tions on the transcribed strand, as described for COSMIC signature 5 
(ref. 4). In addition, a bias for C>A transversions on the transcribed 
strand (similar to COSMIC signature 4) was also observed and may 
arise from the decreased rate of repair of tobacco-induced guanine 
damage on the non-transcribed strand6.
The activity of a mutational signature depends both on the potency 
of the mutagenic process and the length of time over which it oper­
ates. Recently, activity of COSMIC signatures 1 and 5 was found to be 
correlated with patient age, suggesting that the underlying mutational 
processes are active across the lifetime of somatic cells36. However, no 
association between age and COSMIC signature 5 activity was found 
in urothelial cancer, indicating that other factors drive signature 5 
activity. Independent analysis of the TCGA-130 and DFCI/MSK-50 
cohorts (the two cohorts with available age data in our study) also 
failed to identify an association between age and signature 5* activity 
(P = 0.65; Supplementary Fig. 16). Similarly, on multivariate regres­
sion analysis, ERCC2 mutational status (P = 3.5 × 10−14) and smoking 
(P = 0.038) were significantly associated with signature 5* activity, 
whereas age (P = 0.60) and sex (P = 0.48) were not.
Somatic ERCC2 mutations drive signature 5* activity
To further investigate the factors influencing signature 5* activity, we 
used ABSOLUTE to estimate the cancer cell fraction (CCF) of each 
mutation in the 126 tumors from the TCGA-130 cohort for which 
allelic copy number data were available (Online Methods). Sixteen 
of the 126 tumors (13%) had a somatic ERCC2 mutation, and all 16 
mutations were heterozygous. Eleven of the 16 mutations were clonal 
(defined as Pr(CCF ≥ 0.95) >0.5) and 5 were subclonal. We reasoned 
that, if ERCC2 mutations are responsible for increasing the number of 
signature 5* mutations (rather than just being associated with higher 
signature 5* activity), then tumors with clonal ERCC2 mutations 
would have a higher ratio of clonal to subclonal signature 5* muta­
tions than tumors with subclonal ERCC2 mutations. Supporting this 
hypothesis, we found that clonal signature 5* mutations were enriched 
in tumors with clonal mutations of ERCC2 (clonal/subclonal ratio 
~5, P = 0.0098, pairwise Mann–Whitney test) but not in tumors with 
subclonal ERCC2 mutations (clonal/subclonal ratio ~1.1, P = 0.81) or 
with wild-type ERCC2 (clonal/subclonal ratio ~1.9, P = 0.49; Fig. 6 
and Supplementary Fig. 17). Overall, these data suggest that somatic

ERCC2 mutations are often early events in tumorigenesis and drive 
signature 5* activity.
Signature 5* activity and cisplatin response
Platinum-based therapies are widely used in the treatment of 
urothelial cancers, but individual patients vary in their response to 
treatment. Therefore, predictive biomarkers are needed to guide 
therapy. We recently showed that ERCC2 mutations are enriched in 
urothelial tumors responsive to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and 
other studies have identified additional genetic alterations that char­
acterize cisplatin-responsive tumors37–40. Of the cohorts analyzed 
here, only the DFCI/MSK-50 cohort had cisplatin response data 
available, and there was significantly higher signature 5* activity in 
the 25 cisplatin responders than in the 25 non-responders (P = 0.027; 
Supplementary Fig. 18); however, signature 5* activity was not 
associated with cisplatin response in cases with wild-type ERCC2 
(P = 0.51). Additional studies in larger cohorts will be needed to deter­
mine whether signature 5* activity can be used to predict platinum 
response in urothelial cancer.
DISCUSSION
Here we identify and validate an association between somatic 
non-silent mutations in ERCC2 and activity of a specific mutational 
signature in three independent urothelial tumor cohorts. The sig­
nature is very similar to COSMIC signature 5 (although detected 
using a slightly different methodology applied to different data sets 
and hence called signature 5* here; Supplementary Fig. 1) and is 
characterized by a broad pattern of base substitutions4. Other 
signatures identified in our analysis also resemble described 
signatures, and all have previously been linked to specific underlying 
mutational processes11,24,36.
Urothelial cancer is unique in that it is the only known tumor type in 
which the core NER gene ERCC2 is significantly mutated8. However, 
COSMIC signature 5 activity has been identified in all tumor types 
characterized thus far. Therefore, it is unlikely that ERCC2 mutations 
are solely responsible for signature 5* activity across tumor types. 
Instead, signature 5* (and COSMIC signature 5) may reflect the 
footprint of lower-fidelity DNA repair pathways such as translesion 
synthesis that normally operate in parallel with high-fidelity repair 
pathways such as NER and are upregulated when high-fidelity repair 
is compromised41,42. In urothelial cancer, somatic ERCC2 mutations 
seem to be the most common genetic event driving upregulation of 
lower-fidelity repair pathways and signature 5* activity, whereas, 
in other tumor types, signature 5* activity may result from other 
genetic or environmental factors that result in increased activity of 
lower-fidelity repair pathways. Given that recurrent ERCC2 mutations 
seem to be unique to urothelial cancer and are often early events in 
tumorigenesis, additional efforts to understand the role of ERCC2 in 
bladder tumor biology may provide important insights.
In addition to the association with ERCC2 mutational status, 
we also found that signature 5* activity was increased in smokers, 
although the effect from smoking was modest relative to the effect 
from an ERCC2 mutation. Tobacco exposure is a known risk factor 
for urothelial cancer; however, unlike other tobacco-related tumors 
(such as lung squamous cell, lung adenocarcinoma, and head and 
neck squamous cell cancers), an association between smoking and 
the activity of a specific mutational signature had not previously 
been described in urothelial tumors. Here we noted higher signature 
5* activity among smokers, which may reflect increased activity of 
lower-fidelity repair pathways in the setting of increased levels of 
tobacco-mediated DNA damage.
Together, our data suggest that the genomic imprint of signature 5* 
depends on both the extent of DNA damage (from tobacco or other 
mutagens) and the relative activity of high- and low-fidelity DNA 
repair pathways, which is altered in the setting of an ERCC2 mutation. 
Further studies will be needed to characterize the mechanisms under­
lying signature 5* activity in tumors that lack an ERCC2 mutation and 
to explore potential relationships between signature 5* activity and 
clinically relevant endpoints such as treatment response.

ONLINE METHODS
Data sets. Mutation data and relevant clinical data were downloaded from 
the Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data Analysis Center for the TCGA-130 
cohort and from the journal websites for the DFCI/MSK-50 and BGI-99 
cohorts and are summarized for all cases in Supplementary Table 3 
(refs. 11–13). We considered only coding mutations in mutation signature 
discovery and non-silent mutations in signature enrichment analysis.
Mutation signature analysis. Methods and algorithms. Mutational signature 
discovery is a process of deconvoluting cancer somatic mutation counts, strati­
fied by mutation context or biologically meaningful subgroup, into a set of 
characteristic patterns (signatures) and inferring the activity of each of the 
discovered signatures across samples. Several groups, including ours, have 
used NMF to discover mutational processes4,5,8,43. We have recently described 
the use of a Bayesian version of NMF to discover mutational processes applied 
to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) data in Kasar et al.5,22. Below, we 
provide additional background and technical details regarding the Bayesian 
NMF methodology.
The common classification of SNVs is based on six base substitutions within 
the trinucleotide sequence context including the bases immediately 5′ and 3′ 
to the mutated base. Six base substitutions (C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and 
T>G) each with 16 possible combinations of neighboring bases yield 96 pos­
sible mutation types (or contexts). Thus, the input data for mutation signature 
discovery comprise a 96 × M matrix X, where M is the number of samples 
and each element xij represents the number of observed mutations of context 
i in sample j.
Because a collection of somatic mutations in a cancer genome is the out­
come of multiple mutagenic processes operating over the lifetime of a patient, 
the mutation load xij is a superposition of signature-driven mutation burdens 
xijk (k = 1, 2, …, K) derived from K latent (unobserved) mutagenic processes. 
We further assume that signature-driven mutations xijk are generated 
by a Poisson process parameterized by the context- and sample-specific rates 
yijk  = wikhkj, where wik and hkj denote the contribution of the kth mutagenic 
process to context i and its level of activity in sample j, respectively. Taken 
together, this model describes the observed mutations xij as the sum of the 
expected mutations yijk  as a consequence of K independent mutagenic opera­
tions plus background noise due to false positive mutation calls and other tech­
nical limitations. Accordingly, to detect the underlying mutational signatures, 
one needs to determine wik and hkj for each signature as well as the unknown 
number of signatures, K. From the composite properties of the Poisson proc­
ess, the distribution of total mutation load xij is also Poisson distributed with 
the total rate

as xij ~Poisson(xij|yij). Then, assuming that xij terms are independently con­

where d(x|y) is the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence22. A maximum-
likelihood approach for estimating W and H leads to an NMF problem of 
finding two non-negative matrices W and H that minimize the KL divergence 
between X and WH, that is, minW,H≥0 DKL(X|WH), where W and H correspond 
to the signature-loading and activity-loading matrices, respectively.
In the above formulation, the number of mutational processes or dimen­
sionality K (also called the model ‘complexity’ or ‘order’) still remains 
unknown, and indeed the conventional NMF method requires K as an input22. 
A proper selection of K is important because using K >Ktrue, where Ktrue is 
the true (unknown) underlying number of processes, will lead to overfitting, 
whereas accuracy will be impaired when using K <Ktrue. To effectively address 
the issue of inferring the appropriate number of mutational signatures, we 
applied a Bayesian framework of NMF (Bayesian NMF) described by Tan and 
Fevotte to select an optimal K* value that ensures the best explanation for the 
observed data X (ref. 22). Bayesian NMF exploits a ‘shrinkage’ or ‘automatic 
relevance determination’ technique to prune away irrelevant components 
in W and H that do not contribute to explaining X. This pruning process is 
achieved by introducing relevance weights (or parameters), λk, each associ­
ated with the corresponding kth column in W and kth row in H, and then 
imposing proper priors on W, H, and λ. During inference, columns and 
rows corresponding to irrelevant components rapidly shrink to zero as λ 
approaches its lower bound (which is close to zero and determined by the 
hyperparameters in the priors on λ), and the effective dimensionality K* is 
automatically determined by the number of nonzero columns and rows in 
W and H, respectively22.
The expected number of mutations associated with each mutational sig­
nature was determined after a scaling transformation, X ~WH = 
WH, where 

W = WU−1 and H = UH. The scaling matrix U is a K × K diagonal matrix with 
the element corresponding to the L1-norm of column vectors of W (the sum 
of the elements of the vector). As a result, the kth column vector of the final 
signature matrix 
W represents a normalized profile of 96 trinucleotide muta­
tion contexts associated with the kth signature (the profile vector sums to 1), 
and the kth row vector of the final activity matrix H represents the activity 
of the kth process across samples (the estimated, or expected, number of 
mutations generated by the kth process).
Moderating the effects of hypermutant samples on signatures. One of the 
challenges in discovering mutational signatures in a cohort of tumors with het­
erogeneous mutation burdens is the greater weight of hyper- or ultramutated 
samples in the discovered signatures. This greater weight can mask signals 
coming from samples with lower mutation burdens. To minimize this effect in 
our analysis, we applied a process moderating contributions from hypermutant 
samples to signature discovery, while preserving overall mutation counts in the 
cohort. More specifically, we first identified hyper- and ultramutated samples 
(outliers) as ones with 
N
N
SNV
SNV
median
>
+1.5 IQR 
×
where NSNV is the number of SNVs in a given sample, NSNV
median  is the 
median NSNV across samples, and IQR represents the interquartile range. 
We then split mutation counts in each of the detected hypermutated samples 
into two separate columns with an equal number of mutations. This proc­
ess was iterated, recalculating the median and IQR, until no hypermutated 
samples were detected, which resulted in the new mutation count matrix X*. 
It should be noted that this process preserves overall mutation counts across 
the cohort, while mutational loads in hyper- or ultramutated samples are 
equally partitioned into artificially created samples with the same spectra as 
their corresponding hypermutated samples. Because NMF is a linear dimen­
sionality-reduction process, the original signature activity for hypermutated 
samples can be estimated by simply summing the activity of the artificially 
created samples derived from the original hypermutated sample.
Signature selection. We ran Bayesian NMF 50 times for the mutation count 
matrix X*, processed with the protocol in the above section with exponential 
priors for W and H, and an inverse gamma prior for λ, starting from random 
initial conditions. The hyperparameter for the inverse gamma prior was set 
to a = 10, and the iterations were terminated when the tolerance for λ became 
less than 10−7. All 50 runs in both the TCGA-130 and DFCI/MSK-50 cohorts 
converged to the solution with K* = 4, and among the 50 solutions we selected 
for downstream analyses W and H that had the maximum posterior probabil­
ity (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 3b)22. For the BGI-99 cohort, 44 of 50 
runs converged to the solution with K* = 4, while 6 runs converged to K* = 3. 
After manually reviewing the signatures, we selected the maximum posterior 
solution with K* = 4 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). We also performed mutational 
signature discovery separately for the combined cohort (COMB-279) and the 
combined cohort of muscle-invasive samples (COMB-MI-242) for signature 
comparison. In both cohorts, all 50 Bayesian NMF runs converged to the 
solution with K* = 4. We also analyzed the combined cohort of TCGA-130 
and DFCI/MSKCC-50 samples to investigate the association between smoking 
status and the activity of signature 5*, and here, as well, all 50 runs converged 
to the solution K* = 4.

with the activity of the signature (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 9). 
A straightforward statistical test that compares, for each gene, the distribution 
of signature activities between samples in which the gene is wild type versus 
mutant yields an inflation of significant P values for signatures that are cor­
related with overall mutation burden. This inflation is due to the fact that, 
in general, genes are more likely to be mutated in samples that have a higher 
mutation burden. To eliminate this inflation, we designed a permutation test 
in which we controlled both the gene-specific and sample-specific mutation 
counts when generating random permutations of the observed gene × sample 
binary mutation matrix, following an approach described in Strona et al.44. 
We used as a test statistic T, the one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum P value com­
paring the signature activities of mutant and wild-type samples of a given 
gene. We calculated this test statistic for the observed data, Tobserved, as well 
as for every realization of the permuted mutation matrix, Tr
random, where 
r = 1, 2, …, 105 (the total number of permutations). The final P value assigned 
to the gene was the fraction of permuted realizations with a test statistic equal 
to or more extreme than the observed test statistic (ones for which Tr
random  ≤ 
Tobserved). By maintaining the row and column margins of the observed muta­
tion matrix in every random realization, we corrected for the higher tendency 
of genes to be mutated in samples with higher mutation burden, as evidenced 
by the fact that nearly all genes except ERCC2 are on the diagonals of the 
quantile–quantile plots in Supplementary Figures 2 and 9. Because of sta­
tistical power and computational efficiency considerations, we analyzed only 
genes with a non-silent mutation frequency of >5% across the analyzed cohort. 
We corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg 
procedure and used FDR q < 0.1 as the significance threshold.
Our signature enrichment analysis identified ERCC2 as the top significant 
gene associated with the activity of signature 5* across three independ­
ent cohorts (TCGA-130, DFCI/MSK-50, and BGI-99) and two combined 
cohorts (COMB-MI-242 and COMB-279) (Fig. 3 and Supplementary 
Figs. 4 and 8). In fact, ERCC2 was the only gene with FDR q < 0.1 across 
all five cohorts.
Once ERCC2 was identified as the gene whose mutation status was 
most significantly associated with signature 5* activity, we used the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test in assessing downstream associations between 
smoking status (in samples with mutant or wild-type ERCC2) and over­
all mutation burden (Fig. 5a) or signature 5* activity (Fig. 5b,c and 
Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13).
Clustering analysis. Comparison of the signatures discovered 
(Supplementary Fig. 1) in five cohorts (TCGA-130, DFCI/MSKCC-50, 
BGI-99, COMB-MI-242, and COMB-279) and 30 COSMIC signatures 
was performed using the standard hierarchical clustering R package with 
a distance of ‘cosine’ similarity and ‘average’ linkage options. The cluster­
ing analyses based on mutations attributed to signature 5* (Supplementary 
Fig. 6a,b) or the total number of SNVs (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d) across 96 
mutation contexts were performed using a ‘Euclidian’ distance and ‘ward.
D’ linkage method.
Structure modeling and CLUMPS analysis. As a basis for structural mod­
eling of the ERCC2 protein, we used the crystal structure of the homologous 
protein XPD/Rad3-related DNA helicase (UniProt, Q4JC68) from Sulfolobus 
acidocaldarius (Protein Data Bank (PDB), 3CRV). ERCC2 mutations were 
mapped to the bacterial protein on the basis of a global sequence alignment 
of the two proteins using the UniProt alignment tool with default parameters. 
To assess the significance of the spatial clustering of residues affected by 
missense mutations, we used the CLUMPS method29. Briefly, CLUMPS sum­
marizes all pairwise Euclidean distances (transformed by a Gaussian function) 
between the centroids of mutated residues into a weighted average proximity 
(WAP) score and compares the score to a null model of random mutation 
scattering across all residues in the structure to calculate an empirical P value. 
In this study, we modified CLUMPS by using signature 5* activity instead of 
mutation recurrence levels to calculate the WAP score. The weight of each 
mutated residue r was calculated as nr = Sig5r/max(Sig5), where Sig5r is the 
signature 5* activity of the sample with the mutation r and max(Sig5) is the 
maximal value across all mutated residues. In cases where multiple samples 
had missense mutations affecting the same residue, the average Sig5r value 
for these samples was used.
Forced deconvolution of signature 5* activity into COSMIC signature 4 
and 5 contributions. Projection of the activity of signature 5* onto COSMIC 
signatures 4 and 5 was performed in the combined TCGA-130 and DFCI/
MSK-50 cohort (the 180 cases with known smoking status). We used the NMF 
method45 on the squared error divergence, with a fixed signature-loading 
matrix, W* (96 × 2), where the column vectors corresponded to normal­
ized COSMIC signatures 4 and 5. We used the estimated mutation counts of 
signature 5*, X5* (96 × 180), as an input matrix to NMF. Then, the activity-
loading matrix H* (2 × 180) was determined by standard NMF iteration of the 
multiplicative update algorithm, resulting in X5* ~W*H*. The row vectors in 
H* represent the deconvolution of the activity of signature 5* onto COSMIC 
signatures 4 and 5.
Germline enrichment analysis. We identified all germline variants in 28 
manually curated NER genes: ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC4, ERCC5, 
ERCC6, ERCC8, DDB1, DDB2, GTF2H1, GTF2H2, GTF2H3, GTF2H4, 
GTF2H5, LIG1, RAD23A, RAD23B, XPA, XPC, CETN2, CUL4B, CUL4A, 
CDK7, MNAT1, UVSSA, MMS19, ERCC6–PGBD3, and BIVM–ERCC5. For 
this analysis, we considered only rare variants, defined as those present at <2% 
frequency in the TCGA-130 and DFCI/MSKCC-50 combined cohort (total 
of 180 samples). To identify overall enrichment of NER germline variants 
in samples with high signature 5* activity, we first computed the running 
enrichment score (ES) for somatic ERCC2 mutations46, which quantifies the 
degree to which somatic ERCC2 mutations are over-represented in samples 
with high signature 5* activity (Supplementary Fig. 11a). The rank at the 
maximum running ES score, R* = 53, was chosen to divide samples into 
groups containing samples with high signature activity (rank ≤R*) and low 
signature activity (rank >R*). The overall enrichment of NER pathway germ­
line variants was assessed using a one-tailed Fisher’s exact test with a 2 × 2 
contingency table for ERCC2 mutation status and sample group. We also 
repeated the same statistical test after removing samples with somatic ERCC2 
mutations to examine enrichment of NER germline variants in samples with 
wild-type ERCC2.
Because the functional effects of specific germline variants vary 
depending on the resulting amino acid changes, we performed a separate 
enrichment analysis by further stratifying the germline variants by result­
ing amino acid change. Variant-level signature 5* enrichment analysis was 
then performed for recurrent variants (≥2% frequency) by comparing the 
activity of signature 5* in samples with a specific germline variant and the 
remaining samples using a one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test. To eliminate 
the contribution of ERCC2 somatic mutations to signature enrichment, 
the analysis was restricted to samples with wild-type ERCC2, identifying 
several germline variants that were associated with signature 5* activity 
(Supplementary Fig. 11b).
Estimation of clonality using ABSOLUTE. Tumor samples are frequently 
contaminated with normal cells. ABSOLUTE infers the purity and ploidy of 
these heterogeneous populations using copy number and mutation data47. 
ABSOLUTE also estimates local copy number in cancer cells and the CCF 
of each mutation (the fraction of cancer cells harboring the mutation). To 
determine clonal versus subclonal mutation status for the 126 TCGA samples 
with available data, we followed the procedure described by Landau et al.48 
Specifically, mutations with Pr(CCF >0.95) >0.5 were annotated as clonal, 
whereas others were considered subclonal. The enrichment analysis of clonal 
signature 5* mutations in samples with clonal ERCC2 mutations (Fig. 6 and 
Supplementary Fig. 17) was performed by pairwise comparison of the number 
of clonal and subclonal mutations attributed to signature 5* in samples with 
clonal ERCC2 mutations using the two-tailed pairwise Mann–Whitney test.
Multivariate regression analysis. Age, sex, smoking status, and ERCC2 
mutation status were considered as regression variables to explain the activity 
of signature 5* as a response variable in a multivariate linear regression model. 
Regression was performed using the standard R package.

Transcription strand bias analysis. We reran Bayesian NMF in the muscle-
invasive combined cohort COMB-MI-242, further stratifying mutations by 
transcriptional strand (positive strand (+) or negative strand (−)), resulting in 
a total of 192 mutation contexts—96(+) and 96(−) contexts. Here the negative 
strand refers to the transcribed (template) strand, while the positive strand 
refers to the non-transcribed strand. For example, C>A(−) mutations at a 
GCT motif are added with G>T(+) mutations at an AGC motif, while C>A(+) 
mutations at a GCT motif are added with G>T(−) mutations at an AGC motif. 
Then, the transcription strand bias for C>A mutations at a GCT motif was 
defined as the ratio of the estimated number of C>A(−) mutations at a GCT 
motif to the estimated number of C>A(+) mutations at a GCT motif. As in the 
analysis with 96 contexts, all 50 Bayesian NMF runs with 192 contexts con­
verged to a K* = 4 solution (Supplementary Fig. 15a). The resulting signatures 
showed the strongest transcriptional strand bias for C>A and T>C mutations 
(Supplementary Fig. 15b).
