There is a striking and unexplained male predominance across 
many cancer types. A subset of X-chromosome genes can escape 
X-inactivation, which would protect females from complete 
functional loss by a single mutation. To identify putative 
‘escape from X-inactivation tumor-suppressor’ (EXITS) genes, 
we examined somatic alterations from >4,100 cancers across 
21 tumor types for sex bias. Six of 783 non-pseudoautosomal 
region (PAR) X-chromosome genes (ATRX, CNKSR2, DDX3X, 
KDM5C, KDM6A, and MAGEC3) harbored loss-of-function 
mutations more frequently in males (based on a false discovery 
rate < 0.1), in comparison to zero of 18,055 autosomal and 
PAR genes (Fisher’s exact P < 0.0001). Male-biased mutations 
in genes that escape X-inactivation were observed in combined 
analysis across many cancers and in several individual tumor 
types, suggesting a generalized phenomenon. We conclude that 
biallelic expression of EXITS genes in females explains a portion 
of the reduced cancer incidence in females as compared to 
males across a variety of tumor types. 
On the basis of SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
Program) data from 2008–2012, US males carry an age-adjusted 
excess risk of 20.4% of developing any cancer (516.6 versus 411.2 for 
females per 100,000 person-years) and there is ≥2:1 male predomi­
nance for some individual cancer types1. This excess risk results in 
approximately 153,000 new additional cases of cancer in US men 
annually. Yet, the male predominance in cancer incidence remains 
largely unexplained2. The disparities between men and women occur 
across the world, even after adjusting for differences in gross domestic 
product, geographical region, and environmental risk factors, includ­
ing tobacco exposure1,3. In fact, changes in tobacco use among males 
and females over the past two decades have resulted in a marked 
reduction in the male:female (M:F) ratio of lung and bronchus cancer 
(Fig. 1a). However, over the same time period, the M:F ratios for sev­
eral cancers have remained >2:1, including for those associated with 
tobacco use such as kidney and renal pelvis, urinary bladder, and oral 
cavity and pharynx cancers (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1).
Previous reports have identified X-chromosome genes outside of 
the PAR with higher mutation frequencies in male cancers than in 
female cancers4–6. For example, KDM6A at Xp11.2, which encodes the 
histone lysine demethylase UTX, has loss-of-function mutations more 
predominately in male cancers across multiple subtypes4,7. Among 
female cancers with KDM6A mutations, homozygous mutations are 
common7, suggesting that some tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) on 
the X chromosome outside of the PAR follow the classical Knudson 
two-hit hypothesis in females8. This poses a conundrum because one 
X chromosome in all female cells undergoes X-inactivation during 
embryogenesis, which should leave each female cell functionally 
haploid for non-PAR genes on the X chromosome9. However, a frac­
tion of X-chromosome genes ‘escape’ inactivation and have biallelic 
expression, albeit with poorly understood mechanisms, leading to 
differences across individuals and cell types10–14.
We hypothesized that mutations in TSGs that escape X-inactivation 
could underlie a substantial fraction of excess male cancers, as males 
would require only a single deleterious mutation whereas females 
would require two (Fig. 1b,c). We termed these genes EXITS, for 
‘escape from X-inactivation tumor suppressors’. In female cancers 
with a mutation in an EXITS gene, a corollary of the EXITS hypoth­
esis is that the other allele will be mutated or deleted (Fig. 1c). The X 
chromosome is among the most frequently aneuploid chromosomes 
in female cancers15, and, in mice, alteration of X-inactivation by 
targeted deletion of Xist promotes tumorigenesis16.
Similarly, Y-chromosome loss is observed in ≥30% of male renal 
cell, head and neck, and bladder cancers15,17,18. Age-related loss of 
the Y chromosome in non-malignant blood cells is frequent, occurs 
at an increased rate among tobacco users, and is associated with an 
approximately 3.5-fold-higher risk of developing a non-hematologi­
cal cancer19,20. The Y chromosome harbors evolutionarily ancestral 
homologs of a small fraction of non-PAR X-chromosome genes. 
X-chromosome genes with Y-chromosome homologs are known 
to be more likely to escape X-inactivation21,22. In some cases, 
Y-chromosome genes can rescue viability or other phenotypes upon 
Tumor-suppressor genes that escape from X-inactivation 
contribute to cancer sex bias

loss of their X-chromosome homologs23,24, although for most genes 
there is not clear evidence of functional redundancy. Thus, a second 
corollary to the EXITS hypothesis is that Y-chromosome loss will 
co-occur in tumors in males that have a mutation in an EXITS gene 
with a functional Y-chromosome homolog (Fig. 1c).
RESULTS
Male-biased loss-of-function mutations on the X chromosome 
in cancer
To test the EXITS hypothesis, we performed an unbiased analysis of 
paired tumor–germline exome sequencing data from 4,126 patients 
across 21 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 
Broad Institute data sets (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary 
Table 1). In 1,994 cases, copy number variation data were also 
available based on high-density SNP arrays. The tumors analyzed 
excluded sex-restricted cancers such as prostate and ovarian cancers, 
as well as breast cancer.
We used a conservative mutation classification algorithm to 
ensure that the included variants were restricted to somatic truncat­
ing and missense alterations that were most likely loss of function 
(Online Methods) or DNA copy number loss of at least one allele 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). We applied a permutation analysis to 
determine which genes were mutated in males at frequencies higher 
than expected on the basis of the overall mutation rates in males 
and females for each tumor type and normalized to the number of X 
chromosomes. We performed this analysis for only loss-of-function 
mutations (including likely deleterious single-nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) and indels) in the 4,126 patients with exome data and then 
again for loss-of-function mutation or copy number loss in the 1,994 
patients with both exome and copy number data available.
At false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1, there were no autosomal or 
PAR genes (n = 18,055) that had loss-of-function mutations more 
frequently in male cancers. In addition, at FDR < 0.1, no genes on 
the X chromosome had a significantly increased frequency of silent 
coding mutations in male cancers, and no genes on the X chromo­
some had non-silent loss-of-function mutations more frequently in 
female cancers (Supplementary Tables 2–4). In contrast, at FDR 
< 0.1, 6 of 783 non-PAR X-chromosome genes (ATRX, CNKSR2, 
DDX3X, KDM5C, KDM6A, and MAGEC3) harbored loss-of-
function mutation or loss-of-function mutation/copy number loss 
more frequently in male cancers (Fisher’s exact P < 0.0001 as com­
pared to zero of 18,055 autosomal and PAR genes; Fig. 2a,b, Table 1, 
and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Of note, ATRX25,26, DDX3X27, 
KDM5C28, and KDM6A29 have previously been implicated as TSGs via 
recurrent loss-of-function alterations in cancer genomes and/or by direct 
experimental evidence.
We performed the same permutation analysis in each of the 21 can­
cer types individually to discover tissue- or disease-restricted EXITS 
genes. Loss-of-function mutation or copy number loss was enriched 
in ATRX among male lower-grade gliomas (LGG; FDR < 10−4) and in 
KDM5C among male clear cell kidney cancers (KIRC; FDR = 0.044) 
(Fig. 2c,d and Table 1). There were no autosomal or PAR genes with 
male-biased loss-of-function mutation in any of the individual cancer 
types at FDR < 0.1.
To assess the robustness of these findings, we then used a second 
statistical test on the same data set based on a log-likelihood ratio, 
which also normalizes to the background male and female mutation 
rates in each tumor type and the number of X chromosomes (Online 
Methods). Five of the six genes (CNKSR2, DDX3X, KDM5C, KDM6A, 
and MAGEC3) were rediscovered as significantly more frequently 
mutated across all male cancers in this analysis (FDR < 0.1), as were 
ATRX in male LGG and KDM5C in male KIRC (Supplementary 
Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 7).

EXITS hypothesis. (b) ‘Traditional’ tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) on the X 
chromosome for females and males. A single deleterious mutation in a TSG 
is equally likely to occur in male and female cancers because males have 
only one X chromosome and females have one active X chromosome (Xa; 
pink) and one inactive X chromosome (Xi; purple). (c) Model for EXITS gene 
behavior. In females, there are two active alleles of EXITS genes, and females 
are therefore protected from complete gene loss after a single alteration. 
Complete inactivation of an EXITS gene may require biallelic mutations, 
or mutation with loss of the other X chromosome. In males, one mutation 
could inactivate the only allele of an EXITS gene that has no functional Y-
chromosome homolog, and males would therefore be more likely to develop 
cancers associated with mutations in those TSGs. Alternatively, because 
some genes that escape X-inactivation have Y-chromosome homologs with 
redundant function, cancers with mutations in those genes would be more 
likely to occur in males who also have somatic loss of the Y chromosome.

EXITS gene alterations associated with excess male cancers
Adult LGGs occur at an M:F ratio of ~1.4:1 (or 58.3% male:41.7% 
female)30. Considering that 42% of male LGGs in our data set had 
ATRX mutations as compared to 26% of female LGGs, approximately 
80% of the excess male LGGs in our cohort had ATRX mutations. 
Similarly, 8.6% of the excess male head and neck squamous cell car­
cinomas (HNSC) had KDM6A mutations and 12.1% of the excess 
male KIRC cases had KDM5C mutations (see the Online Methods 
for calculations). However, these figures are undoubtedly an under­
estimate of the total contribution of male-biased alterations in these 
diseases because they only consider stringently defined, loss-of-
function mutations within coding regions and they are limited by 
the sample size of our data sets.
To address the latter limitation, we calculated the number of 
tumor–normal pairs needed for 80% power to detect a coding loss-
of-function mutation on the X chromosome with a significant male 
bias given different M:F disease incidence ratios, basal mutation rates, 
and prevalence of the alteration in a specific population (Fig. 3a). For 
example, KIRC has an M:F incidence ratio of ~2:1 and, therefore, as 
expected, ~50% of all mutations on the X chromosome across all 
KIRC cases are in males because they have only one X chromosome. 
If an EXITS gene were mutated in 5% of all KIRC cases, >1,000 tumors 
would need to be sequenced to have 80% power to detect a fourfold 
male mutation bias. Therefore, many additional cancers, including 
hundreds of tumor types not represented in this data set, will need to 
be assessed before the contribution of EXITS genes to overall excess

male cancer risk can be fully quantified. This calculation provides 
target sample sizes for such studies.
The expression of EXITS genes could also be downregulated in 
the absence of coding mutations by several mechanisms, including 
noncoding mutations or epigenetic changes. We analyzed exome and 
RNA–seq data by patient sex for HNSC and KIRC cases. Essentially 
all tumors with downregulation of EXITS genes (defined by expres­
sion below the 5th percentile of expression in male cancers) in the 
absence of a DNA mutation were from males (22/469 males versus 
2/218 females for DDX3X, P = 0.012 by Fisher’s exact test; 16/450 
males versus 2/216 females for KDM5C, P = 0.071; 23/465 males 
versus 2/217 females for KDM6A, P = 0.0077; Fig. 3b). Whole-genome 
sequencing of a large number of tumors will be necessary to deter­
mine whether noncoding mutations on the X chromosome underlie 
EXITS gene downregulation.
EXITS gene mutations associated with loss of the paired Y or X 
chromosome
Next, we asked whether additional genes that escape X-inactivation or 
have Y-chromosome homologs might also function as EXITS genes. 
We compiled a list of 59 X-chromosome genes with evidence of escape 
from X-inactivation in multiple contexts from studies of human 
lymphoblastoid cells and hybrid fibroblasts12,13,31 (Supplementary 
Table 8). These 59 genes had a higher M:F ratio of loss-of-function 
mutation or copy number loss than other X-chromosome genes 
(P = 0.022; Supplementary Fig. 5a). Similarly, we identified 17 
X-chromosome genes with predicted functional Y-chromosome 
homologs21 (Supplementary Table 8) and found that they had a 
trend toward a higher M:F ratio for loss-of-function mutation or copy 
number loss in comparison to other X-chromosome genes (P = 0.058; 
Supplementary Fig. 5b).
If we excluded the 6 genes we identified as EXITS genes, there was 
no discernible male mutation bias among either the 56 remaining 
escape genes or the 14 remaining X-chromosome genes with func­
tional Y-chromosome homologs (Fig. 3c,d). However, we may have 
failed to identify additional EXITS genes from our data set because 
of power limitations resulting from agnostically assessing all cod­
ing genes. A permutation test limited to genes previously reported 
to either escape X-inactivation (n = 59) or have Y-chromosome 
homologs in humans or in recent mammalian evolution (n = 33)21 
identified 2 additional genes with higher frequencies of loss-of-
function mutation and/or copy number loss in male cancers (FDR 
< 0.1): NLGN4X and RBM10 (Supplementary Table 9). Previous 
functional data support RBM10 as a bona fide TSG32.
We next tested the hypothesis that EXITS genes will harbor bial­
lelic inactivation when mutated in female tumors. We used SNP 
array data to infer which female tumors had lost an entire X chromo­
some and compared the frequency of this event to the incidence of 
loss-of-function mutation or focal copy number loss on the remain­
ing X chromosome (Supplementary Fig. 3). Tumors in females with 
EXITS gene mutations were more likely to have lost the whole other 
X chromosome than tumors without EXITS gene mutations (23.3% 
(10/43) versus 6.2% (45/726), P = 0.0005 by Fisher’s exact test), 
suggesting enrichment for biallelic loss. In addition, 6.3% of the 
tumors in females with an EXITS gene mutation had two loss-
of-function mutations in that gene, although with short-read 
sequencing we were unable to determine whether these were in 
cis or trans.

To determine whether Y-chromosome loss is enriched among 
tumors in males with EXITS gene mutations, we used a conserva­
tive approach to classify Y-chromosome copy number on the basis 
of exome sequencing data across 1,443 tumors from males in our 
data set (Online Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6). Tumors in 
males with loss-of-function mutations in any of the three EXITS genes 
with Y-chromosome homologs (DDX3X, KDM5C, and KDM6A) had 
a trend toward enrichment for Y-chromosome loss in comparison 
to tumors without mutations (10.2% (9/88) versus 5.8% (78/1,355), 
P = 0.077). Tumors in males with a loss-of-function mutation in any 
X-chromosome gene with a predicted functional Y-chromosome 
homolog were more likely to have lost the Y chromosome than those 
without such a mutation (10.6% (15/142) versus 5.5% (72/1,301), 
P = 0.019). Therefore, age- and tobacco-associated spontaneous loss of 
the Y chromosome could disproportionately increase the frequency of 
some cancers in males, as loss-of-function mutation or copy number 
loss of EXITS genes with functional Y-chromosome homologs would 
lead to complete gene inactivation in male cells having lost the 
Y chromosome (Fig. 1c)19.
To assess the relative functional contribution of X–X pairs in 
females as compared to X–Y homologs in males, we compared the 
rate of concurrent mutation and X-chromosome loss in tumors from 
females with the rate of concurrent mutation and Y-chromosome loss 
in tumors from males for the three EXITS genes with Y-chromosome 
homologs (DDX3X, KDM5C, and KDM6A). Tumors from females 
with loss-of-function or copy number mutation were more likely 
to lose the X chromosome than tumors from males with loss-of-
function or copy number mutation were to lose the Y chromosome 
(36% (9/25) versus 8.2% (6/73), P = 0.0022). This result suggests 
that the Y-chromosome homologs in males may not have tumor-
suppressor activity equivalent to that of the EXITS gene alleles on the 
inactivated X chromosome in females.
Hypothesis generation from sex-biased mutation patterns
Among the EXITS genes we identified, DDX3X, KDM5C, and KDM6A 
are recognized escape genes across multiple tissues12,13. CNKSR2 and 
MAGEC3 were more recently suggested to escape X-inactivation as 
determined by next-generation sequencing and epigenetic analyses33. 
There are data in human cell lines showing ATRX escape from X-inac­
tivation using RNA FISH34,35, but ATRX has not traditionally been 
classified among the escape genes12,13,21,31. The ATRX locus is located 
in an X-chromosome region that contains multiple escape genes and/or 
Y-chromosome homologs in lower mammals21, and ATRX escapes X-
inactivation in human trophoblast cells36. Nearly all of the excess male 
cancers with ATRX mutations in our data set were LGG cases (Table 
1). We therefore hypothesized that ATRX may escape X-inactivation 
but only in certain contexts, possibly including in the brain. Tissue-
specific and between-individual variation in X-inactivation escape are 
recognized phenomena that have been described previously14,33.
We took two approaches using RNA–seq to demonstrate evidence 
of X-inactivation escape in putative EXITS genes in tumors and 
normal tissues, constituting analyses of allele-specific expression 
in female cells and male versus female expression levels. At germ­
line heterozygous SNP sites in coding regions from tumors without 
somatic mutations in the tested genes, we observed evidence of bial­
lelic expression in females of ATRX, KDM6A, KDM5C, and DDX3X 
in one or more of six tumor types (glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 
LGG, HNSC, KIRC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and lung squa­
mous cell carcinoma (LUSC)) in which we had identified male-
biased mutations (Supplementary Fig. 7). This included tumor 
types where male-biased mutations were significant in single-cancer 
analysis (for example, ATRX in LGG and KDM5C in KIRC). We 
also analyzed female and male expression levels of EXITS genes 
in tumors without mutations because escape from X-inactivation 
often results in higher expression in female cells11. DDX3X, KDM5C, 
and KDM6A had higher expression in non-mutated female than in 
male tumors across all cancer types tested. Notably, ATRX expres­
sion was only higher in female LGG cases and CNKSR2 expres­
sion was higher only in female LUAD cases, the tumor types for 
each gene where the male loss-of-function mutation bias was also 
seen (Supplementary Fig. 8).
To analyze biallelic expression in normal tissues, we queried data 
from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project, which includes 
RNA–seq data from multiple tissue types in non-diseased individu­
als37. Within local tissue environments, X-inactivation can be skewed 
toward one chromosome as a result of a shared developmental ori­
gin38, which might allow detection of escape from X-inactivation if 
the GTEx biopsy demonstrated higher minor allele expression for 
escape genes than for ‘known’ non-escape genes. Indeed, that is what 
we observed for EXITS genes, including high minor allele expression 
of ATRX in brain biopsies from several donors at multiple anatomical 
sites, suggesting escape from X-inactivation (P < 0.0001 in the cortex 
and P = 0.0224 in the cerebellum in comparison to non-escape genes 
by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; Supplementary Fig. 9).
We also analyzed EXITS gene expression by sex in normal tissue 
biopsies from GTEx. In contrast to the expression pattern in other 
tissues and male brain, ATRX expression in female brain showed 
two distribution peaks and was best fit by models of bimodality 
(P = 0.04; Supplementary Fig. 10a,b). We compared female and male 
expression for the six EXITS genes across multiple tissues and found 
that, while most had higher expression in females at all measurable 
sites, evidence for ATRX escape from X-inactivation was limited 
to female brain (Supplementary Fig. 10c). These data also suggest 
that ATRX undergoes heterogeneous escape from X-inactivation in 
female brain. Further studies will be required to understand whether 
ATRX escape is restricted to certain brain cell subsets or regions, 
or whether there is between-female heterogeneity in escape status, 
and how these phenomena could contribute to male bias among 
ATRX-mutated gliomas.
CNKSR2 was not previously implicated as a TSG in large sequenc­
ing studies39. It encodes a putative Ras-pathway scaffolding protein 
implicated in an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder40. Depletion 
of Cnksr2 from mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts using two independent 
lentiviral short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) resulted in expression changes 
that were enriched in genes associated with oncogene signatures by 
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in the Molecular Signatures 
Database (MSigDB; Broad Institute) C2:CGP collection41, including 
genes involved in transformation by HRAS, KRAS, and the Ras-like 
protein RHOA (Supplementary Fig. 11a–c and Supplementary 
Table 10). In addition, we queried the 50 ‘Hallmarks’ MSigDB data 
sets of genes involved in general cellular function42, a combined 
automated and manual curation of >10,000 gene sets, to overcome 
problems of redundancy and heterogeneity in GSEA. Cnksr2 deple­
tion was most enriched with signatures of mTOR and KRAS sign­
aling (Supplementary Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 11). In 
line with activation of the RAS–MAPK pathway, cells expressing 
Cnksr2 shRNAs had increased ERK phosphorylation and enhanced 
colony-forming activity in soft agar, consistent with in vitro trans­
formation (Supplementary Fig. 11e–g). These findings demonstrate 
how genetic–epidemiological associations such as sex bias may help 
distinguish driver from passenger events and possibly identify cancer-
associated genes with a higher likelihood of functional relevance.

DISCUSSION
Escape from X-inactivation results in expression of two copies of a 
TSG on the X chromosome in females, whereas males only have one 
copy. The EXITS hypothesis is that biallelic expression of these genes 
affords females enhanced cancer protection, which substantively con­
tributes to the observed higher incidence of some tumors in males. 
Our data have provided evidence to support this hypothesis, as the 
genes with an increased incidence of loss-of-function mutations in 
males across many cancer types were exclusively non-PAR genes on 
the X chromosome, including several that are known to be TSGs and/
or known to escape X-inactivation in certain contexts. Genes that 
do not normally escape X-inactivation could also function as EXITS 
genes in some situations, as it is recognized that aberrant or ‘leaky’ 
X-inactivation or escape can occur in cancer cells35,43. Additional 
studies are needed to identify the full complement of sex-biased 
cancer-related genes; these will include the sequencing of more 
tumor–normal pairs to increase statistical power, assessments of 
noncoding genomes for additional mechanisms of EXITS gene inac­
tivation, and interrogation of additional tumor types not represented 
herein to identify disease-restricted sex-biased TSGs.
Undoubtedly, EXITS gene mutations are not the sole explanation 
for differences in cancer incidence between men and women. Alcohol 
use, tobacco exposure, and endocrine biology are known to affect 
cancer epidemiology, with the latter possibly causing female predo­
minance of some cancers. However, these environmental and hor­
monal factors associated with sex-specific differences in cancer could 
interact with EXITS loci or their gene products to modulate cancer 
risk. For example, a clastogenic carcinogen could disproportionately 
affect men if the process of carcinogenesis involves inactivation of an 
EXITS gene or loss of the Y chromosome, as has been shown to result 
from tobacco smoking19. Similarly, enhancers or other regulatory 
elements on the X chromosome that modulate autosomal gene trans­
cription in trans could qualify as ‘noncoding EXITS’ if their loss 
promotes carcinogenesis.
Another implication of our data is that tumors in males and 
females with the same cancer type may have distinct genetics, sepa­
rate from the number of X and Y chromosomes. These differences 
could be directly related to the impact of EXITS gene mutations on 
disease biology or drug response. Alternatively, they could result 
in more general effects in a population because male and female 
cancers of a specific type may be effectively distinct diseases (that 
is, tumors from males without EXITS gene mutations might behave 
similarly to tumors from females, while EXITS-gene-mutated 
cancers could have their own biology). To begin to explore these 
possibilities, we propose that clinical oncology studies should be 
statistically powered to understand sex-specific differences in out­
comes resulting from distinct tumor genetics. In addition, preclini­
cal models can be generated to address the relative contributions 
of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic differences between male and 
female cancers.
Finally, we note that several of the EXITS genes identified herein 
have also been implicated in germline genetic neurodevelopmental 
diseases40,44–47 and that non-malignant disorders with a significantly 
higher risk among males (for example, autism48 and schizophrenia49) 
have been associated with polymorphisms on the X chromosome. 
These data suggest that, besides the obvious link between male sex 
and monogenic diseases associated with mutation of X-chromosome 
genes, the haploid nature of the X chromosome in males may increase 
the risk of developing polygenic diseases other than cancer.

ONLINE METHODS
SEER data. SEER data were downloaded from http://seer.cancer.gov/data/.
Tumor–normal exon sequencing, DNA copy number, and RNA sequencing 
data. Genomic data were obtained from the TCGA data portal (https://tcga-
data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and from additional Broad Institute data sets39,50. 
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects by local institutional review 
boards, and consents were reviewed by the sequencing centers, according to 
TCGA guidelines. To visualize gene expression by mutation status for males 
and females, TCGA data were downloaded and visualized using cBioPortal 
(http://www.cbioportal.org/)51,52.
Mutation classification. Tumor-associated DNA variants were called ‘trun­
cating’ if they resulted in nonsense, insertion, deletion, translation start site, 
or non-stop mutations. Truncating and likely functional missense (loss-of-
function) mutations included all truncating mutations as well as missense 
mutations that occurred at the same site in at least three patients (n = 419 
across the pan-cancer data set, of which 9 were male predominant) or had a 
Cons 46 Vertebrates score (http://ucscbrowser.genap.ca/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?
db=hg19&g=cons46way)53 of greater than 0.9, indicating high conservation 
across species (n = 3,083, of which 124 were male predominant).
Permutation analysis. For each set of events, the probability of observing 
the number of events seen in males was determined by a series of permuta­
tions. Within each tumor type, the probability that any given gene alteration 
would occur in a male was assumed to be directly related to the number of 
mutations across all males, divided by the total number of mutations across 
all samples. This controlled for the number of males in the set as well as the 
relative mutation rate on the X chromosome in males versus females in the 
set. For instance, if 60% of the coding mutations on the X chromosome in the 
data set for a tumor type were in males, then for any given X-chromosome 
gene, assuming there is no selective advantage for males versus females, 
we should see ~60% of the events occurring in males. For each gene, the 
total number of events was counted and a set of random permutations was 
constructed in which each event was randomly assigned a ‘male’ or ‘female’ 
value based on this calculated probability. For the pan-cancer analyses, the 
probability of an event being in a male was calculated on a per-tumor-type 
basis, and events were counted and permuted within each tumor type. Once 
the number of males in the permutation was calculated, it was compared 
against the observed data to see whether the number of males randomly 
generated in this manner was greater than or equal to that observed in the 
data. For each gene, 1 million permutations were carried out, and the frac­
tion of permutations with a greater than or equal number of male events was 
reported as the P value. Multiple-hypothesis correction was then performed 
on the complete set of genes that were affected by the set of events examined, 
and genes with FDR <0.1 (by Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction) were 
reported as significant. For permutations on truncating and loss-of-function 
mutations, this probability was calculated on the basis of the coding muta­
tion count for the X chromosome. For permutations on copy-loss events, 
the frequency of copy-loss events on the X chromosome was used. For the 
combined loss-of-function mutation/copy number loss permutations, the 
sum of these two was used.
Log-likelihood ratio test. Assuming that the only factor differentiating 
the male mutation rate of a gene and the female mutation rate of a gene 
is the difference in the background mutation rate on the X chromosome 
(that is, assuming that there is no selective bias in males for mutating a 
gene), then the probability of a male having a mutation in a gene should 
be directly related to the probability of a female having a mutation in a 
gene, corrected for the number of copies of the X chromosome in females 
(n = 2) and males (n = 1)

where r is the F:M ratio of coding mutations across the X chromosome; if females 
in a set have twice the number of coding mutations on the X chromosome 
as males, it can be expected that any given gene on the X chromosome will 
be twice as likely to be mutated in a female patient than in a male patient. For 
each test, the actual F:M ratio of coding mutations on the X chromosome in 
the analysis set was calculated and used. Because there is a direct relationship 
between the probability of a mutation in males in this model and a mutation 
in females, we can express the maximum likelihood of the observed data given 
this null model, by maximizing it with respect to the single value of P,

which, using Wilks’ theorem, was converted to a P value for each gene. 
The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for controlling the FDR was then applied, 
and genes with FDR <0.1 were reported as significant.
Copy number determination by SNP array. Probe-level signal intensities 
from Affymetrix SNP6 .CEL files for tumor samples across different cancer 
types were combined, calibrated, normalized, and segmented in a uniform 
fashion as previously described50. Markers identified as having recurrent 
germline copy number variations using normal samples were excluded. For 
samples for which ABSOLUTE54 purity and ploidy calls were available, copy 
numbers were scaled by a factor inversely proportional to the purity estimate 
to remove the effects of admixed normal cells, as previously described50. 
Copy number profiles were deconstructed into underlying somatic events 
using GISTIC55; only focal events with length less than 1 Mb were used, 
to limit normalization bias between males and females on the X chromo­
some. Copy number for a gene was determined using the most extreme copy 
number among the markers spanning the gene. The threshold for calling 
somatic copy number events was chosen by considering the distribution 
of copy number across both male and female cohorts (Supplementary 
Fig. 3). Because normalization decouples overall copy number for the X 
chromosome from that for the autosomes, retention or loss of the entire 
X chromosome was called by applying a threshold of 1.6 to a robust aver­
age of the non-normalized, calibrated signal across the X chromosome 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). The maximum and minimum 0.2% of probe-level 
signals were excluded.
Power analysis. Power calculation was performed using a binomial model 
similarly as previously described39. The power to detect a male-biased 
mutation can be determined by first calculating the maximum number of 
mutations in males, mmax, that would be considered non-significant in the 
null model, based on an inverse binomial cumulative distribution function, 
given the desired bound on the P value (P < 0.1/number of genes), the 
total number of mutations in a gene in the entire cohort, n (a function of 
the fraction of patients with a mutation and the total number of patients), 
and the fraction of all events that occur in males (as opposed to females) 
in the cohort, which determines the probability that a mutation will be in 
a tumor in a male, p0. The power is then determined by the probability of 
discovering at least that many mutations in male patients under the alter­
nate hypothesis, which adjusts p0 by the hypothesized increased relative

To generate figures, we calculated the number of patients (N) required for 
power to detect 80% of genes with a statistically significant male bias, given 
hypothetical values of Rsignal, n, and p0 (Rsignal = 4 in Fig. 3a).
Y-chromosome copy loss determination. We calculated Y-chromosome cov­
erage in megabase bins for paired tumor and normal sequencing data and 
then normalized to total coverage of the exome. A region of the Y chromo­
some at bases 29,000,001–58,000,000 was omitted because of poor coverage. 
An additional region (13,000,001–14,000,000) was removed because of high 
incidence of misalignment. A biphasic pattern of copy number quantification 
was observed in male samples (Supplementary Fig. 6), with a distinct popula­
tion of tumors demonstrating significant median copy loss in comparison to 
paired normal samples. Y-chromosome loss was therefore assigned to those 
samples with <25% the overall coverage of the Y chromosome in the tumor as 
compared to the paired normal sample.
Allele-specific expression analysis. Exome sequencing and RNA–seq data 
from somatic and germline samples of GBM, LGG, HNSC, KIRC, LUSC, and 
LUAD sets from TCGA and brain, lung, and whole-blood sample sets from 
GTEx were analyzed. For each, allele-specific RNA–seq pileup counts were 
called at heterozygous germline sites and tumor sites from cancers (determined 
by exome sequencing) for the respective analysis. Duplicate, non-primary, 
soft-clipped and Phred quality 0 reads were not included in the pileup count. 
For sites where at least 20 reads (tumor samples) or 8 reads (normal samples) 
were detected by RNA–seq, the count of the less frequent allele was divided by 
the total allele count to obtain the minor allele fraction. Data are represented 
as the average minor allele fraction for all sites in the indicated gene or as the 
average of all sites in all genes in the non-escape group.
Analysis of GTEx male versus female expression data. We obtained RNA–seq 
expression data from the GTEx Project as gene reads per sample by access­
ing the project’s pipeline (http://www.gtexportal.org/home/). For each tissue, 
we normalized the signal across samples. The whole-blood samples used were 
restricted to those collected ante mortem. There were 85 whole-blood samples 
(25 female and 60 male) and 360 brain samples (124 female and 233 male) that 
passed quality control and fit the selection criteria. We tested for bimodality of 
ATRX expression in the brain in two ways. First, we fit a Gaussian mixture model 
to the empirical densities using the R package mixtools (http://cran.r-project.
org/web/packages/mixtools/), function normalmixEM with parameters k = 2, 
epsilon = 1e-08, maxit = 1,000, maxrestarts = 20, and assessed the distance 
between resulting means. Second, we tested for bimodality with a likelihood-
ratio test for bimodality in two-component mixtures. The method contrasts the 
likelihood of the data obtained under restricted and unrestricted maximum-
likelihood fits of mixture of normal distributions. Under the assumption of equal 
variance, bimodality solely depends on mixture component weight and the ratio 
of the distance between the means and the variance. With unequal variance, it is 
also determined by the ratio of variances. We used R package diptest to test for 
multimodality (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diptest/).
Calculation of the percentage excess male risk. For a given gene in a specific 
disease, we calculated the excess male risk associated with loss-of-function 
mutation of a single gene on the X chromosome. We cannot assume that the 
M:F ratio in our sample set is the same as the general population incidence of 
that disease, so we adjusted the overall M:F ratio to SEER data for each cancer 
in the US population. The fraction of the excess male risk in the disease attrib­
utable to a specific gene mutation was calculated as follows: (n males with the 
gene mutated in our data set – (Z × n females with the gene mutated in our 
data set))/(n males in our data set – (Z × n females in our data set)), where 
Z is our data set M:F ratio divided by the SEER data M:F ratio.
Cnksr2 knockdown, immunoblotting, and soft agar colony assays. Mouse 
Cnksr2 or control RFP shRNA constructs (oligonucleotide sequences in 
Supplementary Table 12) were cloned according to the protocol at http://www.
addgene.org/tools/protocols/plko/ into a pLKO.1 vector modified to express a 
GFP reporter in place of the puromycin resistance gene. Lentivirus was pro­
duced, and mouse NIH 3T3 cells (from the American Type Culture Collection, 
mycoplasma free) were infected using standard protocols (Addgene). GFP-
positive cells were obtained by sorting after 7 d. Immunoblotting was 
performed as previously described56 using antibodies recognizing phosphor­
ylated ERK (Cell Signaling Technology, 4370), total ERK (Cell Signaling 
Technology, 9102), and tubulin (Sigma, T6074). All primary antibodies were 
used at 1:1,000 dilutions. Soft agar colony assays were performed as previ­
ously described57. After 3 weeks, random microscopy fields with an area of 
3.29 mm2 were scanned and colonies of at least 50 µm2 in size were counted 
using a CellCelector (ALS, Germany).
RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis in Cnksr2 knockdown 
cells. Total RNA was prepared using a miRNeasy kit (Qiagen). Illumina 
sequencing libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA 
sample preparation kits from 500 ng of purified total RNA according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. The finished double-stranded DNA libraries were 
quantified by Qubit fluorometer, Agilent TapeStation 2200, and RT–qPCR 
using the Kapa Biosystems library quantification kit according to the manufac­
turer’s protocols. Uniquely indexed libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios 
and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 with single-end 75-bp reads by 
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core Facilities. Reads 
were aligned to the mm9 reference genome assembly using STAR (v25.1b) 
(https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR). FPKM expression values were calcu­
lated using Cufflinks (v2.2.1) (http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/). 
Spearman correlation and principal-component analysis were performed using 
VIPER (https://bitbucket.org/cfce/viper/). GSEA (http://www.broadinstitute.
org/gsea/) was performed as previously described41,58. Network enrichment 
mapping was performed using Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/).
