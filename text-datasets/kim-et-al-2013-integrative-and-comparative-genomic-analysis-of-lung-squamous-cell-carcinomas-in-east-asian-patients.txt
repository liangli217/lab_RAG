Purpose
Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most prevalent type of lung cancer. Currently,
no targeted therapeutics are approved for treatment of this cancer, largely because of a lack of
systematic understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. To identify therapeutic
targets and perform comparative analyses of lung SCC, we probed somatic genome alterations of
lung SCC by using samples from Korean patients.
Patients and Methods
We performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA from 104 lung SCC samples from Korean
patients and matched normal DNA. In addition, copy-number analysis and transcriptome analysis
were conducted for a subset of these samples. Clinical association with cancer-speciﬁc somatic
alterations was investigated.
Results
This cancer cohort is characterized by a high mutational burden with an average of 261 somatic
exonic mutations per tumor and a mutational spectrum showing a signature of exposure to
cigarette smoke. Seven genes demonstrated statistical enrichment for mutation: TP53, RB1,
PTEN, NFE2L2, KEAP1, MLL2, and PIK3CA). Comparative analysis between Korean and North
American lung SCC samples demonstrated a similar spectrum of alterations in these two
populations in contrast to the differences seen in lung adenocarcinoma. We also uncovered
recurrent occurrence of therapeutically actionable FGFR3-TACC3 fusion in lung SCC.
Conclusion
These ﬁndings provide new steps toward the identiﬁcation of genomic target candidates for
precision medicine in lung SCC, a disease with signiﬁcant unmet medical needs.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
death, resulting in an estimated 1.4 million deaths
peryearworldwide.1Lungsquamouscellcarcinoma
(SCC) accounts for approximately 30% of overall
lung cancer cases. This type of tumor typically oc-
curs in large airways, and the etiologic role of smok-
ing in lung SCCs is well established.2
In lung adenocarcinoma, it has been observed
that patients harboring mutations in the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene typically dem-
onstrate dramatic responses to EGFR tyrosine
kinaseinhibitors.Thisprovidedtheﬁrstdemonstra-
tion that oncogenic alterations could serve as thera-
peutic biomarkers in lung cancer.3,4 Subsequent
large-scale clinical trials based on genotype-guided
patient stratiﬁcation have demonstrated a superior
clinical beneﬁt of molecularly targeted therapies
compared with standard chemotherapy in patients
with lung adenocarcinoma who have EGFR muta-
tions and ALK fusions.5-7 Other molecular inhibi-
tors targeting BRAF, ERBB2, RET, and ROS
alterations are currently being pursued in clinical
trials with promising initial results.
Previous studies have demonstrated recurrent
mutation of several genes in SCC, most notably
TP53, NFE2L2, and CDKN2A8-11 as well as copy-
number alterations of SOX2, CCND1, FGFR1, and
CDKN2A12-14 in the pathogenesis of lung SCC. Re-
cently, a large-scale comprehensive analysis of a
large lung SCC cohort was reported by The Cancer

Genome Atlas (TCGA) Network that identiﬁed statistically recurrent
somatic mutations in 18 genes that included TP53, NFE2L2, KEAP1,
PIK3CA, CDKN2A, MLL2, HLA-A, and others.15 However, in con-
trasttolungadenocarcinoma,inwhichmolecularlytargetedtherapies
areinroutineclinicalusetotreatsubsetsofindividualswithalterations
in genes such as EGFR and ALK,3-7 there are no approved targeted
therapiesforlungSCC.Moreover,subsetsofpatientswithlungcancer
with no apparent therapeutic biomarkers, such as EGFR and ALK,
generallyhaveworseprognosis,promptingthenecessityofidentifying
driver oncogenic events for this subset of patients.1,16
In lung adenocarcinoma, the prevalence and distribution of spe-
ciﬁc oncogenic mutations vary widely among demographic groups
and are especially pronounced when comparing individuals of mostly
white and East Asian descent. For example, East Asians display a
higher rate of EGFR mutations and a lower rate of KRAS muta-
tions.17,18 These demographic differences have had a substantial im-
pact on the management of lung adenocarcinoma at regional centers
and on the design of clinical trials.
In lung SCC, no large studies have yet been completed to deter-
minethespectrumofgenomicalterationsinAsians.Theprevalenceof
smoking among Koreans is still high ( 40% among men), and SCC
accounts for 25% to 30% of lung cancer cases.19 To identify therapeu-
tic targets in lung SCC, we probed somatic alterations in tumor sam-
ples from Korean patients and compared the results with data from
the completely nonoverlapping TCGA cohort,15 which consisted pri-
marily of patients from academic centers in the United States. Here,
we present the multidimensional analysis of genomic alterations in
more than 100 Korean patients with lung SCC by using whole-exome
and transcriptome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism
array analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Population
The study included an institutional review board–approved retrospec-
tive analysis of 104 Korean patients with lung SCC. Information on sex, age,
tumor stage, smoking record, and overall survival was extracted from the
clinicaldatabaseforthiscohort(DataSupplement).Noneofthesepatientshad
previously been subject to genomic characterization, and no patients from
these hospitals were part of the TCGA study of lung SCC.
Sample Preparation, Sequencing Data Analysis, and
Statistical Methods
Analysis of sequencing data was performed as previously described.15,20
Detailed methods for sample preparation and sequencing analysis can be
found in the Data Supplement (for statistical analysis, each statistical method
usedisdescribedinthetextwherethedataarepresented).Enrichmentanalysis
of speciﬁc somatic mutations and copy-number alterations in somatic copy-
numberalteration(SCNA)clusterswasperformedbyusingFisher’sexacttest.
Exclusivity and co-occurrence of mutations were examined by using one-
tailed Fisher’s exact tests. For multiple test adjustment, false discovery rate was
controlled by calculating q values.21 Other statistical methods are described in
the main text and the Data Supplement.
RESULTS
Patient Cohort Description
To provide comprehensive understanding of genetic abnormal-
ities occurring in lung SCC, we used massively parallel paired-end
sequencingtechnology22toperformwhole-exomesolution-basedhy-
brid capture sequencing of 104 matched tumor/normal pairs. These
samples were from individuals who underwent resection of a lung
SCCfrom2005to2012.Themedianageofpatientsinthestudywas65
years with a median of 29.0 months of follow-up (Korean columns in
Table 1). The cohort included ﬁve self-reported never-smokers, 52
former smokers, and 47 current smokers; most patients had extensive
smoking histories. The cohort included 43 stage I, 41 stage II, 18 stage
III, and two stage IV lung SCC tumors, all of which were primary
resection specimens. Clinical and histopathologic information for the
cohort set used in the study is provided in the Data Supplement. In
addition to whole-exome sequencing, we also conducted transcrip-
tomesequencingandcopy-numberanalysisforasubsetofthispatient
cohort (Data Supplement).
Detection of Somatic Aberrations
Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data from our cohort iden-
tiﬁed a total of 29,353 point mutations and 935 insertion or deletion
events across 104 tumor/normal pairs in coding regions of the ge-
nome. Mean sequencing depth in the target regions was 62.8X. Of the

29,353 point mutations, 21,550 resulted in an amino acid change in
the corresponding proteins. Individuals displayed a mean point mu-
tationrateof8.71mutationsperMb(range,1.19to36.2mutationsper
Mb). Among nonsynonymous substitutions, transitions and trans-
versions at CpG sites were the most commonly observed mutational
context with a rate of 16.18 per Mb and 9.53 per Mb, respectively.
Mutations at Cp(A/C/T) sites were the second most commonly ob-
served context at 7.68 per Mb (Data Supplement). Hierarchical clus-
tering of tumors based on mutational spectra is shown in the
Data Supplement.
We applied the MutSig method to identify genes that demon-
strated evidence of statistical selection for mutation in our
cohort.20,23-25 MutSig is a computational algorithm that takes into
account gene length, composition, silent-to-nonsilent mutation ra-
tios, and other factors, and it identiﬁed six genes that displayed signif-
icant enrichment for mutations as deﬁned by q  0.1, with robust
evidence of expression in lung SCC: TP53, RB1, PTEN, NFE2L2,
KEAP1, and MLL2 (Fig 1 and Data Supplement). A second MutSig
analysis, in which only genes annotated in the Catalogue of Somatic
Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database were considered, rediscov-
ered TP53, RB1, and PTEN and additionally nominated PIK3CA as
statistically signiﬁcant (Data Supplement). Additional genes with an-
notatedrolesincancerthatdidnotreachstatisticalsigniﬁcancebutdid
display recurrent mutations were CHD7 (nine mutations), KRAS
(two), NF1 (13), EGFR (two), CDKN2A (three), IBTK (three), TIE1
(ﬁve), NOTCH1 (seven), NOTCH3 (nine), FBXW7 (four), FGFR1
(two), FGFR2 (two), KDM6A (ﬁve), and APC (four; Fig 1). Of note,
oneoftwopatientswithanEGFRmutationdemonstratedacanonical
exon 19 deletion and the other demonstrated D347N. Both KRAS
mutations resulted in G12C substitutions.
SCNAs were inferred from sequencing data by read-depth anal-
ysis (Data Supplement). We used GISTIC 2.0 analysis26,27 to identify
statistically recurrent peaks of ampliﬁcation and deletion and identi-
ﬁed 19 regions of focal ampliﬁcation and 25 regions of deletion with a
q0.25(DataSupplement).Themostsigniﬁcantlyampliﬁedregions
were 3q26, an amplicon including SOX2; 8p11 (FGFR1, WHSC1L1);
7p11 (EGFR); 11q13 (CCDN1); and 4q12 (KDR, KIT, PDGFRA).
Deletion peaks tended to be more broad and included 2q37, 4q35
(CASP3), 9p21 (CDKN2A), and 10q23 (PTEN). The copy-number
variations were also conﬁrmed and validated by using high-density
single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (Data Supplement).
Hierarchical clustering of the cohort based on the SCNAs dem-
onstratedthreeclusters(DataSupplement):Cluster1wasdeﬁnedbya
paucityofSCNAs(depictedinredinFig1C),Cluster2wasdeﬁnedby
both broad and focal 3q ampliﬁcation (depicted in green in Fig 1C),
and Cluster 3 was deﬁned by broad 3q ampliﬁcation and SCNAs in
cyclin genes and receptor tyrosine kinase–related genes (depicted in
magenta in Fig 1C; Fisher’s exact test: CCND1, P  .03; CCND2, P 
.001; ERBB2, P  .04; FGFR1, P  .02; EGFR, FRS2, and PDGFRA, all
P  .001). Cluster 1 demonstrated a lower mutation rate compared
withtheotherclusters(DataSupplement).Thisclusteralsocontained
some samples with lower calculated tumor purity, which may have
contributed to a lower prevalence of genomic alterations. Cluster 2
exhibitednearexclusivitywithRB1mutations(Fisher’sexacttest:P
.001) and enriched in PIK3CA-activating mutations (P  .007). Vir-
tuallyallthepatientsinthethirdcluster(magentainFig1C)possessed
TP53 mutations (Fisher’s exact test: P  .001; Data Supplement).
Identiﬁcation of Recurrent Structural Variants by
Using RNA Sequencing
Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on a subset of 26
individuals from the original cohort. We ﬁrst used these data to vali-
date our mutation calls by calling the mutations in the RNA sequenc-
ing data. After controlling for coverage, we validated more than 72%
of coding single nucleotide variants and 86% of events in genes de-
pictedinFigure1(DataSupplement).Analysisofthesedataidentiﬁed
atotalof296genefusionsinvolving244distinctfusionpartners(Data
Supplement).28 No fusions involving the ALK, RET, or ROS1 kinase
genes were observed. We observed recurrent fusions involving the
CASP1 gene (four), IGF2BP2 (two), and KRT5 (two). We identiﬁed
single-fusioneventsinvolvingtheFGFR3andGSK3kinasesinthe26
initial individuals surveyed.
DetailedanalysisoftheFGFR3event(insampleJ9)demonstratedan
in-frame fusion of exon 8 of TACC3 with exon 17 of FGFR3 (Fig 2A), a
fusion event recently reported as oncogenic and potentially therapeuti-
cally targetable in glioblastoma multiforme, bladder cancer, and other
typesofcancer,includingprostatecancer.29-33Weextendedanalysistoan

tionalindividual(J1)withanFGFR3-TACC3fusionbyreversetranscrip-
tase polymerase chain reaction (Fig 2B). We conducted genomic DNA

vations, we further probed the TCGA lung SCC RNA sequencing data

rent in lung SCC. All six patients with fusion transcripts involved the
omission of the last exon of FGFR3, which was instead fused in-frame to
various exons of TACC3 and accompanied by an increase in FGFR3
transcript level (Data Supplement).
Comparative Mutational Analysis of Lung SCCs in
East Asian and Mostly White Patients From the
United States
By using the set of genomic alterations in this lung SCC cohort,
we investigated the association among the spectrum of somatic muta-
tions with clinical parameters. Most of the major somatic mutations
did not have a statistical association with overall survival (Data Sup-
plement).WedidobservethatsomemutationsorSCNAsweresignif-
icantlyassociatedwithpoorsurvival(DataSupplement).Thebiologic
signiﬁcance of alterations in genes with apparent prognostic value,
such as MLL2 mutations, requires further experimental analysis and
validation in additional independent cohorts.
Given that no systematic comparison has yet been reported for
lung SCC among different ethnicities, we compared the spectra of
mutational and SCNAs of this cohort to a similarly sized cohort
recently reported by the TCGA,15 consisting mostly of white patients
from the United States (Table 1). Both cohorts displayed a similarly
high rate of mutations of TP53 (73% Korean, 81% TCGA; Fisher’s
exact P  .16), mutations in the NFE2L2/KEAP1 genes (33% and
31%; P  .85), and those in PIK3CA/PTEN (24% and 24%) and
NOTCH1 (7% and 8%; P  .9). Both cohorts also demonstrated
enrichment for CpG transition and transversion mutations. SCNAs
involving SOX2, FGFR1, KDR/PDGFRA/KIT, and PTEN were also
observed at comparable frequencies. One notable difference among

the data sets was somatic alterations in cell cycle regulatory genes,
including CDKN2A and RB1. In the TCGA cohort, CDKN2A muta-
tions were observed in 15% of patients and homozygous deletions in
33%. In contrast, CDKN2A mutations and copy-number alterations
were infrequent in the Korean cohort (4% and 5%, respectively; P 
.007 and P  .001, respectively); however, mutations of RB1 were
more common in the Korean cohort (15%) than in the TCGA cohort
(4%; Fisher’s exact P  .005).
Both our data and the TCGA data set15 conﬁrmed previous

served in the TCGA cohort.15 We noted two cases of KRAS G12C but

HRAS were virtually absent in this cohort, although putative loss-of-
function events in negative regulators of RAS such as RASA1 and NF1
were observed at appreciable frequencies (7% and 13%, respectively;
summarized in the Data Supplement).

group of core pathways demonstrated mutually exclusive mutational
patterns (Fig 3). An exception to this exclusivity relationship was the
strict co-occurrence of MLL2 and KDM6A mutations (Fisher’s exact
P  .001). It is of note that members of these two core pathways were
also likely to interact functionally, given the observation that muta-
tions in NFE2L2 and ARID1A or ARID1B co-occur (P  .001; Data
Supplement). Squamous cell differentiation pathways involving inac-
tivating mutations of NOTCH genes were also frequently altered15,20
(Fig 3). FGFR kinase ampliﬁcation and mutations were frequent and
were identiﬁed in 18 individuals, and PI3K was the most commonly
altered serine/threonine kinase family with mutational events in 17
individuals (Fig 3).
DISCUSSION
This study has identiﬁed a potentially targetable fusion gene in lung
SCCs, FGFR3-TACC3, which deﬁnes a new speciﬁc subset for
potential targeted therapy in lung SCC and was recently reported
by others.32,33 Previously, FGFR small-molecule inhibitors were
shown to possess therapeutic activity in lung SCC cells with FGFR
family kinase ampliﬁcation and mutation.14,35 Clinical activity and
safety of BGJ398 in FGFR1-ampliﬁed lung SCC and AZD4547 in
various types of solid tumors have recently been demonstrated.36,37
The FGFR antagonists are also under clinical investigation in lung
SCCs with mutations or ampliﬁcation of FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3
as more diversiﬁed inclusion criteria (clinical trials NCT01761747
and NCT01795768). Preclinical model studies of FGFR3-TACC3
in glioblastoma and bladder cancer demonstrated encouraging
utility of FGFR inhibitors in the treatment of cancer cells harboring
the fusion gene.29-31 Thus, it is likely that clinical trials could be
expanded to test the efﬁcacy of these agents in patients with FGFR3
fusions in lung SCC with concurrent development of companion
diagnostics. Despite apparently modest demographic inﬂuences in
lung SCC, this study also points out the value of analyzing different
cohorts, since the TCGA study initially missed the identiﬁcation of
the FGFR3 fusion events.15

In contrast to lung adenocarcinomas in which the frequency of
genomic alterations in oncogenes differs among ethnic groups,34,38 in
lung SCC we found that the mutational landscape of two different
population groups with similar sized samples had overall congruent
mutational frequencies in major oncogenic drivers and tumor sup-
pressors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst and largest
comparison of the integrative genomic analysis of a given cancer type
with more than 100 individuals between populations of Asians and
mostly white patients from the United States. Although the frequency
of mutations in RB1 and CDKN2A genes were signiﬁcantly different
between the two cohorts, frequencies of other major genes, including
TP53, NFE2L2, KEAP1, PIK3CA, PTEN, MLL2, and NOTCH1, were
similartoeachother.Thus,inlungSCC,inwhichmostofthepatients
had been chronically exposed to heavy doses of tobacco, the subtle
genetic and inherent biologic inﬂuences seem to be largely overridden
byheavymutationalburdensfromexogenouscarcinogens.Ithasbeen
shown that several cancer types, including melanoma, display highly
increased mutational burden with exogeneous carcinogens linked to
their tumorigenesis. Systematic comparative genomic proﬁling of this
andothercancertypeswithhighmutationalratesinpatientsindiffer-
ent ethnic groups will help address the generalizability of the ﬁndings.
Although most SCCs occur in smokers, a small subset of never-
smoking patients (ﬁve of 104 for this study; seven of 178 for TCGA)
stillsuccumbtothedisease.Wedidnotcaptureinformationregarding
exposure to second-hand smoke or environmental toxins such as
asbestos in this study, and smoking status was self-reported. We be-
lieve that larger-scale genomic studies speciﬁcally targeting these sub-
sets will help to better elucidate underlying biologic mechanisms
associated with the never-smoker lung SCC subgroup. In this sense, it
is of note that ongoing large-scale cancer consortium studies, includ-
ing that of TCGA, currently aim to delineate genomic aberrations in
morethan500patientsforeachsubtypeofcancerinthecomingyears.

in TCGA limit the ability to perform comparative analyses of less
common clinical features or genomic alterations with sufﬁcient statis-
ticalpower.Giventhecomplexitiesofthecancergenomiclandscape,it
is likely that expansion of patient samples in the future will help to
further clarify subtle genetic differences in lung SCC contributed by
ethnicity. It should also be noted that demographic heterogeneity
within the TCGA cohort was not well annotated, which prevented the
possible exclusion of patients of Asian descent in this cohort for our
comparative analyses.
In summary, this study has comparatively described the recur-
rentsomaticmutationsinlungSCCsinalargecohortofEastAsians.It
revealed the commonality in the pathogenesis of lung SCC across
ethnicities and identiﬁed several targetable oncogenic mutations in a
disease with large unmet medical needs.
