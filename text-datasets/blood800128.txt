Two recent publications have investigated the role of the ITGB2 variant
p.E573K in familial chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other
hematologic malignancies. The ﬁrst paper, “Whole exome sequencing
in families with CLL detects a variant in Integrin b 2 associated with
disease susceptibility,” by Goldin et al,1 reported the identiﬁcation of a
rare, nonsynonymous coding variant in ITGB2, p.E573K, which was
found in 6 out of 59 families with CLL. The penetrance of the variant
within the families was not reported, although the variant was also
found in 3 individuals with CLL from among 173 unrelated CLL clinic
patients. All 3 patients were diagnosed at an early age and had a family
history of CLL or lymphoid malignancy. A follow-up paper, in which
the frequency of this variant was studied among Tasmanian patients
withCLLandotherhematologicmalignancies,wasrecentlypublished.2
In this population, the minor allele frequency of this variant was 0.013,
and the authors found that the variant was not enriched among families
with hematologic malignancies compared with Tasmanian population
controls or publicly available non–TCGA (The Cancer Genome
Atlas), non-Finnish European controls from the Exome Aggrega-
tion Consortium database.3 The authors of this latter paper suggest
that given the conﬂicting ﬁndings, a gene-based analysis of ITGB2
should be performed to determine whether multiple rare deleterious
variants in this gene may contribute to disease risk.
These ﬁndings and this suggestion are of particular interest to us, as
we have just recently completed such a gene-based rare variant
association analysis in CLL.4 We focused on rare germ line variants
(,1% minor allele frequency) identiﬁed by whole-exome sequencing
in a cohort of 646 CLL patients of European descent (composed of
80 familial individuals, 178 sporadic individuals, and 388 individuals
of unknown familial status) compared with 8920 ethnically matched
population controls without cancer at sampling. We included only 1
representativeprobandfromeachofthe80familiesinthestudycohort,
and therefore, the 80 familial samples were all from unrelated
individuals. ITGB2 was not signiﬁcant in an exome-wide gene
burden analysis (q 5 0.99).
We next queried our data set to compare the incidence of the ITGB2
variant p.E573K in our patient cohort to that reported in the Goldin et al
study. We found 7 CLL patients heterozygous for this germ line variant
out of 554 CLL patients studied (only patients who had coverage at
that genomic site sufﬁcient to make a high-conﬁdence genotype
call were included). In the control cohort, we found 68 individuals with
heterozygous calls at p.E573K out of a total of 8669 samples with
sufﬁcient coverage for a high-conﬁdence call. The allele frequency of
p.E573Kinour cases(0.0063) appears to be aboutthe same as theallele
frequencyobservedbyGoldinetalintheirvalidationcohort(0.0087,or
3 out of 346 alleles in 173 patients). Furthermore, in our data set, the
allele frequency of p.E573K in cases was slightly enriched over the
frequency in controls (0.0039). However, a 1-sided Fisher’s exact test
comparing the ratio of alternate to reference alleles in cases vs controls
shows that this slight enrichment in cases is not statistically signiﬁcant,
with a P value of .163 (Table 1). We note that the same 1-sided Fisher’s
exact test performed on Goldin et al’s validation cases compared with
a cohort of non-Finnish European controls taken from the Exome
Aggregation Consortium database is also not statistically signiﬁcant,
with a 1-sided Fisher P value of .456 (Table 1).
Given that rare variants in ITGB2 were not signiﬁcantly associated
with CLL in our exome-wide gene burden analysis and the p.E573K
variantwasnotspeciﬁcallyenriched,weanalyzedalloftherarevariants
identiﬁed in ITGB2 in cases vs controls in our data set. Out of a total of
110 rare, nonsynonymous, biallelic coding variants found in ITGB2 in
our study cohort, only 13 were present in CLL cases, of which only
5 were present in more than one individual with CLL. The p.E573K
variant was the most recurrent variant, with 7 heterozygous affected
individuals, followed by the missense variant p.R529W, which was
found in 5 heterozygous CLL patients. Of the 30 CLL cases carrying a

rare variant in ITGB2, only 7 had known familial vs sporadic status, and
all 7 were sporadic.None of the variants found in cases was signiﬁcantly

Blood Web site).
Of the 646 CLL patients in our cohort, 259 were CLL patients
enrolledinaprospectivecohortnaturalhistorystudyattheDana-Farber
Cancer Institute (DFCI),5-8 281 were from the German CLL Study
Group’s randomized CLL8 clinical trial,9,10 and 106 were from
published whole-exome sequencing data from the International Cancer
Genome Consortium.11 Of the 7 CLL patients in this data set who carry
the p.E573K germ line variant, 6 were sampled from the German CLL
Study Group and were of unknown familial status; the remaining
patient was from the DFCI cohort and was a sporadic case. The
preponderance of heterozygous p.E573K samples from the German
CLL8 study as compared with DFCI samples is suggestive, as it raises
the possibility that the observed frequency of the p.E573K variant in
the study by Goldin et al may be related to a speciﬁc European
subpopulation represented by their study subjects. Without information
on the ethnic background of the subjects in the Goldin et al study, or the
association of the variant with CLL within families, it is difﬁcult to fully
assess this possibility. If the familial patients in the Goldin et al study
were sampled from a relatively homogeneous European subpopulation
with a higher frequency of p.E573K, it may be a benign allele that
marks a particular subpopulation rather than a true predisposition
allele. Alternatively, it may contribute to disease development within
that subpopulation; assessing this would require a large control group
from within the same subpopulation.
We believe these studies illustrate the ongoing challenges of
disentangling germ line predisposition to CLL, when intrinsic popula-
tion variability must be taken into account and predisposing alleles may
be speciﬁc to small subpopulations. This is further complicated by the
likelihood that the genetic basis of CLL within families may differ
from that of the general population.4 Larger case cohorts categorized
by familial vs sporadic status, as well as case cohorts analyzed by
ethnicity together with genetically matched control groups, are
likely to be required to better deﬁne the heritability of CLL.
