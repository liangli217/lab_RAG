LBCL is the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, 
accounting for up to 35% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. 
Although DLBCL is curable with combination therapy 
(R-CHOP) in over 60% of patients, the remainder develop recurrent 
or progressive disease that is often fatal. DLBCL is also a genetically 
heterogeneous disorder with multiple low-frequency mutations, 
somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), and structural variants 
(SVs)1–8. These tumors are currently thought to arise from antigen-
exposed B cells that transit through the germinal center (GC)1. 
Aspects of the GC environment, including the high proliferation 
rate, physiologic activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-
mediated immunoglobulin receptor editing, and aberrant somatic 
hypermutation (SHM) are conducive to malignant transformation1.
The heterogeneity of DLBCL is reflected in transcriptionally 
defined subtypes that provide insights into disease pathogenesis 
and candidate treatment targets9–14. The cell-of-origin (COO) clas-
sification identifies ABC- and GCB-type DLBCLs1,9. ABC-DLBCLs 
are currently thought to be derived from B cells that have passaged 
through the GC and are committed to plasmablastic differentiation1. 
These tumors have increased NF-kB activity, and a subset exhibit 
Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic 
mechanisms and outcomes

Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, is a clinically and genetically hetero-
geneous disease that is further classified into transcriptionally defined activated B cell (ABC) and germinal center B cell (GCB) 
subtypes. We carried out a comprehensive genetic analysis of 304 primary DLBCLs and identified low-frequency alterations, 
captured recurrent mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and structural variants, and defined coordinate signatures in 
patients with available outcome data. We integrated these genetic drivers using consensus clustering and identified five robust 
DLBCL subsets, including a previously unrecognized group of low-risk ABC-DLBCLs of extrafollicular/marginal zone origin; two 
distinct subsets of GCB-DLBCLs with different outcomes and targetable alterations; and an ABC/GCB-independent group with 
biallelic inactivation of TP53, CDKN2A loss, and associated genomic instability. The genetic features of the newly character-
ized subsets, their mutational signatures, and the temporal ordering of identified alterations provide new insights into DLBCL 
pathogenesis. The coordinate genetic signatures also predict outcome independent of the clinical International Prognostic 
Index and suggest new combination treatment strategies. More broadly, our results provide a roadmap for an actionable 
DLBCL classification.

genetic alterations in NF-kB modifiers and proximal components 
of the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway and perturbed terminal B cell 
differentiation1,11,13,15. In contrast, GCB-DLBCLs are postulated to 
originate from light-zone GCBs1. A subset of these tumors have 
alterations in chromatin-modifying enzymes, PI3K signaling, and 
Gα​-migration pathway components and frequent SVs of BCL2  
(refs 1,16–18). Although patients with ABC-DLBCLs have been 
reported to have less favorable responses to standard therapy than 
those with GCB-DLBCLs8,9,19, targeted analyses of select altera-
tions have suggested that additional genetic complexity remains to 
be defined2,11,18,20,21. Despite the recognized clinical and molecular 
heterogeneity in DLBCL, previous genomic studies of this disease 
have largely focused on single types of alterations: mutations, 
SCNAs, or SVs.
To address these issues, we performed whole-exome sequenc-
ing (WES) with an expanded bait set to capture known SVs in 304 
DLBCLs from newly diagnosed patients. Of the patients, 85% were 
uniformly treated with R-CHOP and had long-term follow-up; 
a subset of these patients were enrolled in the prospective multi-
center RICOVER60 trial22. This representative and clinically anno-
tated DLBCL cohort was used to comprehensively detect mutations, 
SCNAs, and SVs, and to identify five groups of patients with out-
come-associated coordinate genetic signatures, three of which were 
previously undescribed.
Results
Significantly mutated driver genes. We detected mutations using 
WES data from 304 primary DLBCLs, 55% of which lacked patient-
matched normal samples (Methods, Supplementary Fig.  1, and 
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). To include all 304 samples in the dis-
covery cohort for candidate cancer genes (CCGs), we developed new 
computational methods to filter germline variants and artifacts from 
tumor-only samples (Methods and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). 
After filtering, we found a median of 3.3 and 6.6 mutations/Mb in 
the paired and tumor-only samples, respectively, suggesting that an 
average of 3.3 germline variants per megabase persisted after fil-
tering. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that these rare germline 
variants are spread throughout the genome and have minimal effect 
on the detection of CCGs (beta-binomial test, P =​ 0.4; Methods and 
Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3).
We applied MutSig2CV23 to the 304 DLBCLs and detected 98 
CCGs (q value <​ 0.1; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3a). Our CCG 
list includes previously reported mutational drivers, including the 
tumor suppressor TP53; the chromatin modifiers KMT2D(MLL2), 
CREBBP, and EP300; the components of the BCR, Toll-like receptor 
(TLR), and NF-kB signaling pathways CD79B, MYD88, CARD11, 
and TNFAIP3(A20); certain components of the RAS pathway, KRAS, 
and BRAF; NOTCH2 and the NOTCH signaling modifier SPEN; and 
the immunomodulatory pathway components, B2M, CD58, CD70, 
and CIITA (Fig. 1a)3–8. As a result of the improved methodology 
and increased sample size, we identified 40 additional previously 
undescribed CCGs in DLBCL8, many of which have defined roles in 
other lymphoid malignancies or cancers (Supplementary Fig. 3r,s). 
These include the additional modifiers of the BCR and TLR signal-
ing pathways PTPN6(SHP1), LYN, HVCN1, PRKCB, and TLR2; the 
histone genes HIST1H1B, HIST1H1C, HIST1H1D, HIST1H2AC, 
HIST1H2AM, HIST1H2BK, HIST1H3B, and HIST2H2BE; BCL11A, 
IL6, CCL4 (MIP-1β), and the PD-1 ligand CD274 (PD-L1) (Fig. 1a 
and Supplementary Fig. 4).
To identify genes with significant clustering in three-dimen-
sional protein structures, we used CLUMPS24, which revealed 22 
CCGs (q value <​ 0.1). Notably, 7 of 22 CCGs were not captured by 
MutSig2CV, including an additional member of the KRAS-BRAF-
MEK1 pathway, MAP2K1(MEK1) (Supplementary Fig.  5a–d and 
Supplementary Table  3b). CLUMPS also provided insights into 
the putative function of mutations: TP53 alterations clustered 
into two distinct regions of the protein, the DNA-binding site and 
the Zn2+ atom coordinating residues required for p53 structural 
integrity (Fig. 1b); non-canonical BRAF mutations perturbed the 
autoinhibitory interaction of the P and activation loops (Fig.  1b 
and Supplementary Fig. 5e); and clustered mutations in CREBBP, 
PTPN6(SHP1), and GNAI2 abolished polar interactions around 
the catalytic pocket (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 5). A second 
step in CLUMPS (called EMPRINT) identified enrichment of 
mutations at protein-protein interfaces. For example, RHOA muta-
tions cluster at the binding interface with multiple Rho guanine 
nucleotide exchange factors (ARHGEFs), keeping RHOA in its 
inactive form and de-repressing PI3K signaling and Gα​ migration 
(Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 6a–c, and Supplementary Table 3c)1. 
In addition, CLUMPS identified mutation clustering at the accep-
tor groove of FBXW7 that limits CCNE1 recognition and CUL1/
SKP1/FBXW7-mediated degradation, a previously reported tumor 
suppressor mechanism in other cancers (Supplementary Fig. 6d,e 
and Supplementary Table 3c).
Mutational processes. Mutational processes leave a characteristic 
imprint, a mutational signature, in the cancer genome that reflects 
both DNA damage and repair. We applied our SignatureAnalyzer 
tool25, which uses both the three-base mutational sequence context 
and mutational clustering in genome coordinates, to discover four 
signatures (three signatures after removal of a single micosatelite 
instability case; Supplementary Methods, Fig.  2a, Supplementary 
Fig.  7a–c, and Supplementary Table  4). The predominant muta-
tional signature, which explained 80% of all mutations, was a spon-
taneous deamination at CpG sites (C >​ T_CpG, hereafter referred to 
as aging; Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Consistent with the 
underlying etiology of this signature, older patients had more muta-
tions driven by spontaneous deamination (Supplementary Fig. 7d). 
We also identified two AID-driven signatures, canonical AID 
(cAID) and AID2, that reflect different repair mechanisms following 
AID-induced deamination of cytosine to uracil. The cAID signature 
was characterized by increased C >​ T/G mutations at a known AID 
hotspot, the RCY-motif(R =​ A/G,Y =​ C/T)25,26. Consistently, cAID 
activity was enriched at sites of both physiologic and aberrant SHM 
(Fig.  2a,b, Supplementary Fig.  7e, and Supplementary Table  4)27.
The AID2 signature was dominated by A >​ T/C/G mutations at 
WA(W =​ A/T) motifs and shared some properties of the COSMIC9/
non-canonical AID signature25,26.
Next, we determined the relative contributions of aging, cAID, 
and AID2 mutational processes to each CCG (Fig.  2c and and 
Supplementary Fig.  7f). Genes that are known targets of aber-
rant SHM, including BCL2, SGK1, PIM1, and IGLL5 (Fig. 2c and 
Supplementary Table  4d,e)25, had predominant AID signatures 
(cAID +​ AID2) comprised of mutations with the lowest ratio of non-
silent to silent mutations (Fisher's exact test, P =​ 1.97 ×​ 10−4) that 
clustered within 2 kb of the transcription start site (Fisher's exact 
test, P =​ 2 ×​ 10−41), consistent with the AID mechanism. In contrast, 
genes including MYD88, KMT2D(MLL2), EP300, TNFAIP3(A20), 
TP53 and PRDM1(BLIMP1), had predominant aging mutational 
signatures (Fig.  2c, Supplementary Fig.  7f-g and Supplementary 
Table 4c).
Chromosomal rearrangements and SCNAs. We next assessed 
recurrent SVs using a previously described targeted sequencing 
approach28 and a pipeline that included four different algorithms 
followed by a filtering and split-read validation step (Methods, 
Supplementary Figs. 1 and 8a–e, and Supplementary Table 5). We 
identified at least 1 SV in 64%(189 of 296) of tumors; translocations 
that juxtaposed genes to strong regulatory elements were the most 
common SVs (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 8d).
As expected1,29,30, IGH, BCL2, BCL6, and MYC were the most 
frequently rearranged genes (40, 21, 19, and 8%, respectively)

TBL1XR1 (4%), TP63 (3%), CIITA (3%), and ETV6 (2%) (Fig. 3a–g 
and Supplementary Figs. 8e and 9a–f). The IgH enhancer region 
was the predominant rearrangement partner (97%) of BCL2, and 
breakpoints were almost exclusively distal to the BCL2 open read-
ing frame (ORF) (Fig. 3a,d). Although Ig loci enhancers were the 
most common rearrangement partners for BCL6 and MYC (57 
and 58%, respectively), we identified multiple additional partners;

breakpoints in BCL6 and MYC were predominantly proximal to the 
ORFs (Fig. 3b,c,e,f). PD-L1 and PD-L2 SVs involved multiple regu-
latory elements juxtaposed to intact ORFs with increased expres-
sion of the respective protein (Fig. 3g–i), as previously described28. 
Less frequently, Ig regulatory elements (IgH, Igκ, and Igλ) were jux-
taposed to additional partners with known roles in GCBs (BACH2, 
BCOR, FOXP1, miR-17-92, CCND1, CIITA, SOCS1, and NFKBIE) 
(Supplementary Fig. 9a–g).
Next, we identified significantly recurrent SCNAs with the 
GISTIC2.0 program based on the WES data. We detected 18 arm- 
level and 18 focal regions of copy gain and 2 arm-level and 32 focal 
regions of copy loss (q value ≤​ 0.1, frequency ≥​ 3%; Fig.  4a). The 
frequencies of these SCNAs ranged between 5 and 32% and the 
number of genes in focal peaks varied from 4 (2p16 gain) to 549 
(1q23.3 gain). We did not observe chromothripsis in our dataset 
(Supplementary Note).
To provide insights regarding candidate driver genes in SCNAs, 
we leveraged available gene expression data and performed an 
integrative analysis2 (Supplementary Note and Supplementary 
Table 6). For each focal alteration, genes from the COSMIC Cancer 
Gene Census with a significant association between transcript abun-
dance and SCNA were identified (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 6, 
and Supplementary Methods). In DLBCLs with focal 13q31.3 gain, 
the transcript with the highest fold change was miR-17-92 (Fig. 4a 
and Supplementary Table 6).
CCGs were significantly more likely to reside within focal 
SCNAs (Fisher exact test, P =​ 10−44; Fig.  4a), suggesting that 
these driver genes were perturbed by multiple mechanisms. 
Significant genes altered by mutations, CN gain, and/or SVs 
included 
NOTCH2(1q23.3), 
CCND3(6p21.1), 
PD-L1/PD-L2/
JAK2(9p24.1), and BCL2(18q/18q21.33); those perturbed by muta-
tions and CN losses included CD58(1q13.1), TNFAIP3(6q23.3), 
PRDM1(BLIMP1;  6q21), B2M(15q15.3), PTEN/FAS(10q23.31), 
CD70(19p13.3), 
RHOA(3p21.31), 
TMEM30A(6q14.1), 
and

immune escape7,28,31–33, including alterations of MHC class I loci,

Association of individual genetic features to outcome. Next, we 
assessed the prognostic value of our identified genetic drivers for 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the 
subset of patients who were treated with R-CHOP-like therapy 
(n =​ 259, median follow-up 78.5 months). Loss of 1q42.12, MYC 
SVs and gains of 18q21.33/BCL2, 13q31.3/miR-17-92, and 18p  
were independently predictive of inferior PFS; all retained sig-
nificance when added to IPI risk groups (Fig. 4b,c, Supplementary 
Fig. 10a, and Supplementary Table 7). MYC SVs, 13q31.3 gain, and 
1q41.12 loss were also associated with shortened OS alone and 
when added to International Prognostic Index (IPI) risk groups

Fig. 3 | Chromosomal rearrangements in primary DLBCLs. a–c, SVs of BCL2 (a, green), BCL6 (b, blue), MYC (c, red), and partner genes (gray) are 
visualized as Circos plots. Genes also targeted by somatic mutations are highlighted in black. Thickness of partner linking lines indicates frequency 
(numbers indicate frequency >​ 1). d–f, Breakpoints in BCL2 (d), BCL6 (e), and MYC (f) are plotted in their indicated genomic context. Arrows indicate the 
transcription start site in the coding direction; boxes indicate exons including first coding exon (red); green bar below indicates which exons are protein 
coding. Translocation partners are indicated by the shading of the circle at the tip of each breakpoint (IgH, black; Igκ, dark gray; Igλ, light gray; non-Ig 
partners, white and name of partner gene above). g, Circos plots of chromosomal rearrangements involving the PD-1 ligand loci, PD-L1, and PD-L2 (orange). 
Plots are labeled as in a–d. h, Stick figures for indicated translocations involving either PD-L1 or PD-L2. See h for details. Raw reads counts are visualized 
below. Reads mapping to the first and second partner gene are highlighted in green and orange, respectively. i, PD-L1/PAX5 (left, PD-L1, brown; PAX5, 
pink) and PD-L2 (right; PD-L2, brown) immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of the cases in h. IHC was repeated twice with similar results.

(Supplementary Fig. 10b–d and Supplementary Table 7). Notably, 
the prognostically significant individual alterations were SCNAs 
or SVs rather than mutations (Fisher's exact test; PFS, P =​ 0.007; 
OS, P =​ 0.02).
Coordinate genetic signatures capture biologic heterogene-
ity. DLBCLs in this series harbored a median of 17 (range: 0–48) 
genetic drivers, prompting additional analyses of co-occurring 
alterations. We applied non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) 
consensus clustering34 to the 158 identified genetic driver altera-
tions and discovered five robust subsets of tumors (clusters) with 
discrete genetic signatures (hereafter referred to  as coordinate 
genetic signatures; C1–C5; 51–72 samples each) and an additional 
subset without detectable alterations (C0; 12 samples) (Methods, 
Fig. 5, Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12, and Supplementary Table 8).
Cluster 5. The 64 cluster 5 (C5) DLBCLs exhibited near-uniform 
18q gain, likely increasing expression of BCL2 and other candidate 
drivers such as MALT1 (refs.21,35). These tumors also had frequent 
mutations in CD79B (48%, 29 of 60) and MYD88 (50%, 30 of 60), 
alterations previously associated with ABC-type DLBCLs11,13,20. 
MYD88 mutations selectively involved L265P and often occurred 
in association with CD79B mutations (Fisher's exact test, P =​ 0.036; 
Figs.  5 and 6a,b and Supplementary Fig.  13a). Additional altera-
tions linked to ABC-DLBCLs, including gains of 3q, 19q13.42 and 
inactivation of PRMD1, were observed in this cluster2,36, as were the 
prognostically significant 18p copy gains (Figs. 4b and 5). In this 
cluster, 96% (45 of 47) of tumors with available COO designations 
were ABC-DLBCL type (Fisher exact test, P <​ 0.001).
Major components of the C5 signature, including frequent BCL2 
gain, concordant MYD88L265P/CD79B mutations, and additional

(blue, right) are visualized as mirror GISTIC plots, with arm-level events (left) and focal events (right). Chromosomes are shown on the vertical axis. Green 
line denotes q value of 0.1. SCNAs are labeled with their associated cytoband/arm followed in brackets by the frequency of the alteration, the number 
of total genes and COSMIC-defined cancer genes in GISTIC2.0-defined regions, respectively. For focal events, COSMIC cancer genes with a positive 
correlation to gene expression in our data (fold change >​ 1.2, q <​ 0.25) are indicated in the brackets. Genes that were also significantly mutated (in black) 
or subject to chromosomal rearrangement (n =​ >​2, green) in our dataset are highlighted after the brackets. Other important drivers are labeled in gray. 
b, Kaplan Meier plots of individual genetic factors predictive for PFS in univariate and multivariate models of the R-CHOP treated cohort with PFS data

Fig. 5 | Identification of groups of tumors with coordinate genetic signatures. Non-negative matrix factorization consensus clustering was performed 
using all CCGs, SCNAs, and SVs in the 304 DLBCL samples (columns). Clusters C1–C5 with their associated landmark genetic alterations are visualized 
(boxed for each cluster). Samples without driver alterations are represented as cluster C0. Genetic alterations that were positively associated with each 
cluster were identified by a one-sided Fisher test and ranked by significance (q <​ 0.1, green line, bar graph to the right). Non-synonymous mutations, black; 
synonymous mutations, gray; single CN loss (1.1 ≤​ CN ≤​1.6 copies), cyan; double CN loss (CN ≤​ 1.1), blue; low-level CN gain (3.7 copies ≥​ CN ≥​ 2.2 copies), 
pink; high-grade CN gain (CN ≥​ 3.7 copies), red; chromosomal rearrangement, green; no alterations, white; gray crossed, not assessed. Header shows

mutations of ETV6, PIM1, GRHPR, TBL1XR1, and BTG1 (Fig. 5), 
were similar to those recently described in primary CNS and testic-
ular lymphoma28. Thus, we identified systemic DLBCLs with CNS 
or testicular involvement and found that eight of nine patients with 
testicular disease were in this cluster (Fisher's exact test, P <​ 0.001), 
as was one of two patients with CNS involvement. These data sug-
gest that the C5 genetic signature is associated with extranodal tro-
pism and extend the findings of targeted sequencing studies linking 
MYD88L265P with extranodal disease37,38. C5 DLBCLs have the high-
est contribution of cAID and associated aberrant SHM indicative of 
tumors that have passaged through the GC (Fig. 6c)1.
Cluster 1. The majority of the 56 cluster 1 (C1) DLBCLs exhibited 
BCL6 SVs in combination with mutations of NOTCH2 signaling 
pathway components, predominantly activiating PEST-domain 
mutations of NOTCH2 and truncating mutations of its negative 
regulator, SPEN. C1 DLBCLs also had increased transcriptional 
abundance of NOTCH2 and BCL6 target genes, as determined by 
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Supplementary Fig. 13f). In 
addition, these tumors harbored frequent mutations of the NF-kB 
pathway members BCL10 and TNFAIP3(A20), and FAS (Fig. 5 and 
Supplementary Fig. 4). Alterations in NOTCH and NF-kB pathway 
components and FAS mutations were previously found in low-grade 
marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs)39–42, and BCL6 translocations 
were described in transformed MZLs43.
C1 DLBCLs had no histologic features of MZLs, suggesting that 
these tumors were either occultly transformed before diagnosis or 
that they derived de novo from a common extrafollicular B cell pre-
cursor with shared genetic features. MZLs typically arise in a setting 
of chronic inflammation, often in response to pathogen-driven anti-
gen stimulation44. Notably, C1 DLBCLs exhibited multiple genetic 
bases of immune escape, including inactivating mutations in B2M, 
CD70, FAS, and SVs of PD-L1 and PD-L2 (Fig. 5 and Supplementary 
Figs. 4 and 9i)28,31.
The majority of C1 DLBCLs were classified as ABC-type tumors 
by transcriptional profiling (Fisher's exact test, P =​ 0.01). Although 
25% (13 of 51) of C1 DLBCLs exhibited MYD88 mutations, these 
were almost exclusively MYD88non-L265P, in contrast with the predom-
inant MYD88L265P found in C5 ABC DLBCLs (P <​ 0.001; Fig. 6a,b 
and Supplementary Fig. 13a). MYD88L265 and MYD88non-L265P differ 
in their ability to coordinate IRAK1/IRAK4-containing signaling 
complexes and activate NF-kB11. C5 and C1 ABC-DLBCLs also 
differed in the contribution of cAID to their mutational spectrum 
(C1 versus C5, P <​ 0.001; C1 versus rest, P <​ 0.001; Fig.  6c and 
Supplementary Fig. 13d). In contrast with C5 tumors, C1 DLBCLs 
had low or absent cAID activity, providing additional evidence of an 
extrafollicular origin and a lower rate of SHM (Fig. 6c)45.
Taken together, the coordinate genetic signatures of C1 and C5 
ABC-type DLBCLs define subsets of tumors with distinct patho-
genetic mechanisms. These findings (Figs. 5 and 6b) also suggest 
different targeted treatment strategies in the genetically distinct 
ABC-DLBCLs: inhibition of proximal BCR/TLR signaling and 
BCL2 in C5 and perturbation of NOTCH and BCL6 signaling and 
immune evasion mechanisms in C1.
Cluster 3. The majority of the 55 cluster 3 (C3) DLBCLs harbored 
BCL2 mutations with concordant SVs that juxtaposed BCL2 to 
the IgH enhancer (Fisher exact test, P =​ 3.3 ×​ 10−35; Fig.  5 and 
Supplementary Fig. 9h). C3 DLBCLs also exhibited frequent muta-
tions in chromatin modifers, KMT2D, CREBBP, and EZH2, and 
increased transcriptional abundance of EZH2 targets by GSEA 
(Supplementary Fig. 13g). These tumors also had alterations of the 
B cell transcription factors MEF2B and IRF8, and indirect modifiers 
of BCR and PI3K signaling, TNFSF14(HVEM), HCNV1, and GNA13 
(Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4). In addition, these tumors had 
two alternative mechanisms of inactivating PTEN: focal 10q23.31/
PTEN loss and predominantly truncating PTEN mutations (Fig. 5). 
The two types of PTEN alterations are noteworthy because the 
PTEN N-terminal and C-terminal domains have distinct roles in 
antagonizing PI3K/AKT signaling, maintaining genomic stability, 
and inducing murine B cell lymphomas 18,46,47. C3 genetic alterations 
have been described in follicular lymphoma (FL) and de novo GCB-
type B cell lymphomas4,16–18,36,48–53. Consistent with this finding, 95% 
(38 of 40) of C3 DLBCLs with available COO designations were of 
the GCB type (Fig. 5).
Cluster 4. The 51 cluster 4 (C4) DLBCLs were characterized by 
mutations in four linker and four core histone genes, multiple 
immune evasion molecules (CD83, CD58, and CD70), BCR/Pi3K 
signaling intermediates (RHOA, GNA13, and SGK1), NF-kB modi-
fiers (CARD11, NFKBIE, and NFKBIA), and RAS/JAK/STAT path-
way members (BRAF and STAT3).
C4 DLBCLs were primarily GCB type (Fisher's exact test, 
P =​ 0.01), suggesting that C4 and C3 DLBCLs represent genetically 
distinct subsets of GCB tumors (Fig. 5). Comparison of the C3 and 
C4 genetic signatures further revealed that these GCB-DLBCLs uti-
lize distinct mechanisms to perturb common pathways such as PI3K 
signaling. In contrast with C3 DLBCLs, C4 tumors rarely exhibited 
PTEN alterations, but harbored more frequent RHOA mutations 
(Fig. 5). In addition, C4 DLBCLs rarely exhibited BCL2 alterations.
Unlike C3 tumors, C4 DLBCLs largely lacked alterations in 
chromatin-modifying enzymes, but frequently exhibited mutations 
in H1 linker histones and additional core histones that have also 
been described in FL52,54,55. The identified mutations in the globu-
lar or C-terminal domains of H1 linker histones likely reduce their 
association with chromatin and/or perturb interactions with addi-
tional effector molecules (Supplementary Fig. 4)54–56. H1 linker and 
core histone alterations may increase mutation rates by opening 
chromatin and exposing DNA to ongoing AID activity; indeed, C4 
tumors have a significantly higher mutational density (P <​ 0.0001; 
Supplementary Fig. 13c).
The distinct genetic features of C3 and C4 GCB-DLBCLs 
also suggest specific targeted therapies, including inhibition of 
BCL2, PI3K, and the epigenetic modifiers EZH2 and CREBBP in 
C3 GCB tumors, and JAK/STAT and BRAF/MEK1 blockade in C4 
GCB-DLBCLs.
Cluster 2. The 64 cluster 2 (C2) DLBCLs harbored frequent bi-
allelic inactivation of TP53 by mutations and 17p copy loss (Fig. 5 
and Supplementary Fig. 13e). In addition, C2 tumors often exhib-
ited copy loss of 9p21.13/CDKN2A and 13q14.2/RB1, which perturb 
chromosomal stability and cell cycle2. Consistent with these findings, 
transcriptionally profiled C2 DLBCLs had decreased abundance of 
TP53 targets and increased levels of E2F targets, as determined by 
GSEA (Supplementary Fig. 13h). C2 tumors also had significantly 
more driver SCNAs (P <​ 0.0001) and a higher proportion of genome 
doubling events (P <​ 0.001; Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 13b). 
This cluster included both GCB- and ABC-DLBCLs, as did prior 
DLBCL cohorts with TP53 mutations in targeted analyses57. C2 
DLBCLs shared features of previously described DLBCLs with TP53 
alterations and multiple SCNAs of p53/cell cycle modifiers2. These 
tumors also exhibited more frequent copy gains of 1q23.3/MCL1. 
Prognostically significant SCNAs, including 13q31.31/miR-17-92 
copy gain and 1q42.12 copy loss, were also more common in these 
DLBCLs (Fig. 5).
Cluster 0. A small subset of 12 DLBCLs lacked defining genetic driv-
ers. Significance analyses (MutSig2CV and GISTIC2.0) restricted to 
C0 DLBCLs were also unrevealing. This group included increased 
numbers of T cell/histocyte-rich LBCLs (Fisher's exact test 
P <​ 0.001), a morphologically defined subtype with a brisk inflam-
matory/immune cell infiltrate10. The absence of detectable drivers

in these DLBCLs may reflect lower tumor purity or different patho-
genetic events.
BCL2 and MYC alterations. . Recently, subsets of tumors with co-
occurring BCL2 and MYC and/or BCL6 SVs and/or increased 
protein expression have been described and associated with poor 
outcome (‘double and triple hit’ DLBCLs)58. Notably, we detected 
prognostically significant MYC SVs and focal 18q21.33/BCL2 gain 
(Fig. 5) and additional alterations that perturbed the expression of 
BCL2, BCL6, and MYC target genes in multiple clusters (8q gain, 
C5; BCL2 SVs, C3; 13q14.2/miR-15/16 loss, C2; BCL6 SVs, C1; 
13q31.3/miR-17-92 gain59, C2; Fig.  5). However, tumors with co-
occurring BCL2 and MYC SVs were significantly more frequent in 
C3 DLBCLs (Fisher's exact test, P =​ 0.003). These findings identify 
multiple genetic bases of BCL2 and MYC deregulation and suggest 
that current definitions of double and triple hit DLBCLs are insuf-
ficiently precise.
Temporal ordering of genetic events in DLBCL clusters. We 
next determined the cancer cell fraction (CCF) for each genetic 
driver and used a CCF threshold of 0.9 to identify each altera-
tion as being either clonal or subclonal; 74% of mutations, 49% of 
SCNAs, and 57% of SVs were clonal in this series (Supplementary 
Fig. 14, Supplementary Table 10a, and Methods). Each of the above-
mentioned mutational signatures (Fig. 2) contributed to subclonal 
mutations, suggesting that all of the mutational processes were 
ongoing (Supplementary Fig. 14e). We also applied a method for 
mutation ordering60 in tumors that harbored pairs of alterations that 
were clonal and subclonal. Pairs with an excess of clonal to sub-
clonal events were identified and highly significant pairs were high-
lighted (q value <​ 0.1; Fig. 6j, Supplementary Fig. 15, Supplementary 
Table 10, and Methods). Given that clonal alterations occur before 
subclonal events60, this method allowed us to order the timing of 
genetic alterations (Fig. 6e–j).
In C5 ABC-DLBCLs, defining mutations of CD79B, MYD88, and 
TBL1XR1 were largely clonal, whereas additional genetic events, 
including 18q copy gain and PIM1, BTG1, and ETV6 mutations 
were more frequently subclonal (Fig.  6i,j). In C1 ABC-DLBCLs, 
mutations associated with MZL, NOTCH2, SPEN, and BCL10, and 
immune evasion, CD70 and B2M, were largely clonal, whereas FAS 
and TNFAIP3 mutations and BCL6 and PD-1 ligand SVs were often 
subclonal (Fig. 6e). In informative tumors, the ordering of paired 
alterations supported the hypothesis that BCL6 SVs were later, 
potentially transforming, events (Fig. 6j).
The alterations in C3 GCB-DLBCLs were largely clonal (Fig. 6g), 
although a subset of BCL2 SVs were subclonal (Fig. 6g,j). In C4 pri-
marily GCB-DLBCLs, defining alterations of immune evasion mol-
ecules, BCR/PI3K signaling intermediates, NF-kB modifiers, and 
RAS/JAK/STAT pathways members were largely clonal (Fig. 6h). In 
contrast, mutations of linker and core histone genes were variably 
clonal and subclonal (Fig. 6h), suggesting that at least some of these 
alterations were later events.
C2 DLBCLs were largely characterized by clonal loss of 17p, 
followed by TP53 mutations (Fig. 6f,j). Certain prognostically sig-
nificant genetic alterations, 18q21.33 copy gain and MYC SVs, were 
often subclonal (Figs. 4 and 6, and Supplementary Fig. 14a–d).
Outcome associations of DLBCL clusters. We next assessed the 
prognostic significance of the newly defined coordinate genetic 
signatures and identified significant differences in PFS and OS 
(Fig.  6k,l and Supplementary Fig.  16a,b). Patients with C0, C1, 
and C4 DLBCLs had more favorable outcomes, whereas those 
with C3 and C5 tumors had less favorable outcomes (Fig. 6k,l and 
Supplementary Fig.  16a,b). Notably, in patient with C3 tumors, 
outcomes were not dependent on co-occurring MYC/BCL2 SVs 
(Supplementary Fig. 16e). Patients with C2 DLBCLs had a distinct 
trajectory and a steady rate of progression over time (Fig. 6k,l and 
Supplementary Fig.  16a). The genetically distinct COO subtypes 
(C1 and C5 ABC-DLBCLs; C3 and C4 GCB-DLBCLs) had marked 
differences in PFS and OS, with more favorable outcomes occuring 
in the newly defined C1 ABC- and C4 GCB-DLBCLs (Fig. 6m and 
Supplementary Fig. 16d).
These findings likely explain the reported clinical and genetic 
heterogeneity in transcriptionally defined COO subsets9,19–21. For 
example, recent targeted studies have identified poor prognosis 
subsets of ABC DLBCLs with BCL2 copy gain and GCB tumors 
with BCL2 SVs, defining alterations of the genetically distinct C5 
ABC and C3 GCB DLBCLs (Figs. 5 and 6m, and Supplementary 
Fig. 16d)21.
We next constructed a multivariate model considering both IPI 
and genetic signatures as variables, with low-risk IPI and favor-
able (C0/C1/C4) genetic signatures as reference (PFS, Fig. 6n; OS, 
Supplementary Fig. 16d). For low-risk IPI patients, those with C5 
features had a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.01 compared with patients 
with favorable genetic signatures (Fig.  6n). For patients with 
favorable genetic features, those with high-risk IPIs had a HR of 
3.44 compared with those with low-risk IPIs (Fig.  6n). Patients 
with C5 features and high-risk IPI had a HR of 6.91 (3.44 ×​ 2.01) 
compared with the reference group. Thus, the coordinate genetic 
signatures captured outcome differences that were independent 
of the IPI (Fig.  6n, Supplementary Fig.  16c, and Supplementary 
Table 11).
Discussion
We expanded the landscape of recurrent genetic drivers in DLBCL 
using increased sample size and technical innovations, including 
analyses of WES data in the absence of paired normal samples. 
We also temporally ordered these alterations, gained insight into 
biologic function of certain mutations by overlaying them onto 
three-dimensional protein structure and identified the dominant 
mutational processes in DLBCL exomes. Our results highlight the 
complexity of DLBCLs, which have a median of 17 different genetic 
alterations per tumor.
By integrating recurrent mutations, SCNAs, and SVs, we 
defined five distinct DLBCL subsets, including previously unap-
preciated favorable risk ABC-DLBCLs with genetic features of 
an extrafollicular, possibly marginal zone origin (C1); poor risk 
GCB-DLBCLs with BCL2 SVs and alterations of PTEN and epi-
genetic enzymes (C3); a newly defined group of good-risk GCB-
DLBCLs with distinct alterations in BCR/PI3K, JAK/STAT, and 
BRAF pathway components and multiple histones (C4); and a 
COO-independent group of tumors with biallelic inactivation of 
TP53, 9p21.3/CDKN2A and associated genomic instability (C2). 
The key genetic features of these DLBCLs included mutations, 
SCNAs, and SVs, indicating that all three types of alterations are 
needed to capture disease heterogeneity and outcome differences. 
Moreover, DLBCL cluster-associated genes were perturbed by 
multiple mechanisms.
Our approach to define genetically distinct DLBCL subsets 
represents a framework for assessing previously unrecognized het-
erogeneity in transcriptionally defined subsets, linking mutational 
signatures with cluster-predominant pathogenetic mechanisms, 
assessing genetic bases of extranodal disease tropism, and develop-
ing faithful murine models of human tumors. Notably, the DLBCL 
outcome-associated genetic signatures will guide the development 
of rational single-agent and combination therapies in patients with 
the greatest need.

Methods
Patient samples. Our multi-institutional, international group assembled a  
cohort of 351 patient samples diagnosed with a previously untreated, primary 
DLBCL of which 304 passed all below described quality controls. This 304 sample 
dataset was obtained from 4 sources: 129 samples from patients enrolled in  
the prospective, randomized, multi-center RICOVER60 trial22; 103 samples from  
a DFCI/BWH cohort; 67 samples from the Mayo Clinic and University of Iowa 
Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) (51 previously reported 
WES analysis5,61); and 5 samples from the University of Göttingen, Germany. 
Forty-four percent (135 of 304) of samples had a paired normal specimen and 
55% (168/304) of samples were obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded 
(FFPE) tissue (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). All patients had 
a diagnosed primary DLBCL per WHO criteria; this diagnosis was confirmed 
for all RICOVER60 samples by a central pathological review as previously 
described22, and all DFCI/BWH and Mayo cases were confirmed by an expert 
hematopathologist (SJR). The patient characteristics are equally distributed 
across the different sources and summarized in Supplementary Table 2. A total 
of 85% (259/304) of patients were uniformly treated with state-of-the-art therapy 
(rituximab-containing CHOP-like regimen) and had long-term follow-up 
(median: 78.5 months). This study was approved by the institutional review board 
(IRB) of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the IRBs of all other participating 
institutions. All relevant ethical regulations were followed. Informed conset was 
obtained from the human subjects on clinical trial. Per IRB protocol and approval, 
written human subject consent was waived for the additional samples.
Whole-exome sequencing. DNA quality control. Tumor and normal DNA was 
extracted as previously described from lymph node samples, blood and 31 B 
cell lymphoma cell lines, respectively2,5. DNA quality control was performed as 
previously described62. Briefly, genomic DNA was quantified using Quant-iT 
PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and identities of all tumor/
normal DNA pairs were confirmed by mass spectrometric fingerprint genotyping 
of common SNPs.
Exome sequencing. Whole exome capture was performed using the Agilent 
SureSelect Human All Exon 44 Mb v2.0 bait set (Agilent Technologies) as 
previously described28,63,64. In summary, genomic DNA was sheared, end repaired, 
ligated with barcoded Illumina sequencing adapters, amplified, size selected and 
subjected to in solution hybrid capture using the Agilent SureSelect Human All 
Exon v2.0 bait set63,64. Resulting exome Illumina sequencing libraries were then 
qPCR quantified, pooled, and sequenced with 76 base paired-end reads using 
Illumina GAII or HiSeq 2000 sequencers (Illumina). In addition, raw sequencing 
reads of previously in house generated and published WES data for 49 DLBCL 
tumor/normal paired samples5 were processed through identical pipelines as the 
newly generated WES data (Supplementary Figs. 2a and 8a). Exome sequencing of 
cell lines with the spiked-in bait set for SV detection was performed as previously 
described28. The new WES data has been deposited in the dbGAP database (www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) with the accession number phs000450.v1.p1.
Alignment and quality control. To prepare read alignments for analysis, we 
processed all sequence data through the Broad Institute's data processing pipeline, 
Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) as previously described28. For each sample, 
this pipeline combines data from multiple libraries and flow cell runs into a single 
BAM file. This file contains reads aligned to the human genome with quality scores 
recalibrated using the TableRecalibration tool from the Genome Analysis Toolkit 
(GATK)65. Reads were aligned to the Human Genome Reference Consortium 
build 37 (GRCh37) using BWA (version 0.5.9-tpx http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.
net/). Variant detection and analysis of the BAM files were performed using the 
Broad Institute's Cancer Genome Analysis infrastructure program Firehose (http://
archive.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/firehose). Firehose facilitates comparison 
of BAM files from matched tumor/normal pairs and coordinates the execution of 
specific modules including quality control, local realignment, mutation calling, 
small insertion and deletion identification, rearrangement detection, variant 
annotation, computation of mutation rates and calculation of sequencing metrics. 
Module versioning and logging of the specific analytical parameters is also tracked. 
The median sequencing depth of the exome region in the tumor samples meeting 
all quality control cut offs is 87.6×​ (range: 39–206.8). Additional quality control, 
see Supplementary Note.
Copy number analysis from WES data. Initial estimates of exome-wide copy 
number profiles were determined using ReCapSeg66 which creates a copy number 
profile based on coverage across the exome and a panel of normals which  
obviates the need for a paired normal. The allele-specific copy number was 
determined using Allelic Capseg as previously described67,68. For paired samples, 
Allelic Capseg called heterozygous sites from the paired normal, while for the 
tumor-only samples heterozygous sites were called from the tumor itself.  
While this method has lower sensitivity for discovering sites with loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumors, when paired samples are run with this 
method, they show high fidelity to the results when run with a paired normal 
(Supplementary Fig. 3g).
Significance analysis of recurrent SCNAs using GISTIC2.0. Arm-level and focal 
peaks of recurrent copy number alterations were identified from the results of 
Allelic Capseg using GISTIC2.0 (version 129) as previously described69. Regions 
with germline copy number variants were excluded from the analysis. Events with 
a q-value of less than 0.1 were reported significant. We specified a 99% confidence 
interval to determine wide peak boundaries.
Mutation calling. Somatic SNVs and small insertions and deletions (Indels) 
were identified using MuTect (Firehose CallSomaticMutations v131 (ref.70), and 
Indelocator (Firehose CallIndelsPipeline v77 (ref.62)), respectively. When a paired 
normal was not available, we chose a normal sample from our DLBCL cohort that 
showed no evidence of tumor in normal contamination and otherwise acceptable 
QC metrics to remove common germline and potentially remove artifacts resulting 
from batch effect. Mutations were annotated using the oncotator tool (v68)71. Of 
note, we detected a total of 67,518 unfiltered mutations in tumor samples with a 
paired normal and 364,692 in samples without a paired normal. Stringent filtering 
as described below reduced the numbers to 20,328 and 31,586 for samples with 
and without paired normal, respectively. All significant analyses (MutSig2CV, 
CLUMPS, SignatureAnalyser tool) were performed on the filtered MAF file. The 
True-Positive-Rate =​ Sensitivity ( =​ detected true mutations / all true mutations) 
for MuTect in tumor/normal (TN) pairs is above 90% in a blind simulated 
competition among algorithms called Dream challenge 3 (https://www.synapse.
org/#!Synapse:syn312572/wiki/63089). For our tumor-only pipeline, the sensitivity 
is higher than 90% relative to TN pair detection (Supplementary Fig. 2g).
Artifact filtering. OxoG-artifacts were filtered as previously described72. In brief, 
OxoG is an artifact signature results from oxidative damage to guanine during 
library preparation, which causes guanine to pair with adenine instead of cytosine, 
ultimately causing an observed G >​ T mutation. These artifacts will only occur 
on one strand whereas a somatic event will show the change on both strands of 
DNA, and this orientation bias is used to distinguish real events from artifacts. 
This cohort also had single nucleotide artifacts resulting from the use of FFPE 
samples, wherein formaldehyde causes deamination of cytosine resulting in C >​ T 
mutations similar to that of the aging signature but with the same orientation bias 
observed in OxoG events, allowing us to use the same algorithm for determining 
orientation bias which has previously been used on FFPE samples73. In addition to 
the canonical OxoG and FFPE artifacts, this cohort had an artifact characterized 
by recurrent mutations in repetitive regions that have many potential sites for 
mapping in the genome. To control for this, we first realigned SNV-containing 
regions with Novoalign v3.02.08 (http://novocraft.com) and preserved those 
variants that showed evidence in both sets of BAMs74. Subsequently, SNV- and 
Indel-containing regions were reassembled using an approach similar to that of 
Haplotype caller65,75 (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/
tooldocs/current/org_broadinstitute_hellbender_tools_walkers_mutect_Mutect2.
php). We rejected variants in regions with sufficient coverage after reassembly that 
did not have evidence of an alternate allele.
Panel of normals (PoNs) filtering. To remove sequencing artifacts and frequent 
germline events (for tumor-only samples), SNVs and Indels were filtered using 
version 8 of the in-house PoNs, which includes 8,334 WES normals74. Briefly, the 
panel includes for each site eight values, which describe the percent of normals, 
different modes of artifact, and the likelihood that the event is a germline event at 
that site.
Estimation of purity, ploidy, and cancer cell fraction (CCF) using ABSOLUTE. For 
paired samples, purity, ploidy, and CCF estimates for mutations and copy number 
were determined applying the ABSOLUTE algorithm as previously described76. 
Candidate models were reviewed by three independent reviewers (B.C., A.J.D., 
and C.S.) and discordances in the solution picks were resolved by discussion. 
ABSOLUTE models based on AllelicCapseg results and mutation calls from 
tumor-only samples were similarly reviewable to those that came from paired 
samples. Due to the prevalence of heterozygous germline sites in the mutations 
going into ABSOLUTE, the solutions called were more driven by the ABSOLUTE 
copy number profile than the allele frequency distribution in tumor-only samples 
than for paired samples. However, when ABSOLUTE solutions were called, 
independently, on 147 available paired lymphoma samples and those same sample 
samples run without pairs, there was a high correlation in calls of ploidy and purity 
(Supplementary Fig. 3e,f).
Germline somatic logodds filter for tumor-only samples. For each event that passed 
all preceding filters (SNV or Indel), its CCF, purity, ploidy, and local copy number 
were used to determine the log ratio of the probability that its allele fraction is 
consistent with the allele fraction modeled for a hypothetical germline event and 
the probability it is consistent with a modeled somatic event. For additional details, 
see Supplementary Note.
ExAC filtering. After applying the Germline Somatic Log odds filter, we used  
the ExAC database as a final criterion for excluding potential germline events77. 
Using 147 paired non-hypermutator samples, we selected the allele frequency in

ExAC that yielded 98% sensitivity which cut out 50% of the remaining putative 
germline events.
Significance analysis of recurrently mutated genes (MutSig2CV). Significantly 
mutated genes were identified applying the MutSig2CV algorithm and genes with 
a q-value of less than 0.1 were reported as significant23. Notably, with the increased 
background mutation rate from 3.3/MB to 6.6/MB, the power to detect CCGs 
present in 10% of patients dropped from 100 to 98% in tumor-only samples.
Measuring the effect of remaining germline events on determination of significant 
mutated genes using the tumor-only pipeline. To evaluate the performance of the 
newly developed tumor-only pipeline, the paired normals of our DLBCL cohort 
were run as tumor-only samples through the tumor-only pipeline as a null model, 
using one of the paired normal as the ‘normal’ for the others, leaving us with a 
total of 134 samples run through this pipeline. Despite the size of the cohort, when 
running Mutsig2CV on these samples after all filtering 0 to 3 (assigning each 
normal its paired tumor's purity, assuming 10% or 90% purity) significant genes 
were found (Supplementary Fig. 3f), suggesting that any germline sites remaining 
after this pipeline are most likely randomly distributed throughout the genome 
and unlikely to affect the significantly mutated genes detected by Mutsig2CV60. 
In addition, we performed a beta binomial test to determine if the number 
of mutations from tumor-only samples occurring in SMGs was significantly 
overrepresented. The P value was calculated as

where βb is the beta-binomial probability density function, NTO is the number

only samples (MTO =​ 1,516), and MTN is the number of non-silent SMGs detected 
in tumor-normal paired samples (MTN =​ 1,033).
Targeted DNA-sequencing for the detection of chromosomal rearrangements. 
Library construction, sequencing, and pre-analysis processing. Targeted 
rearrangements (Supplementary Table 5a) were captured from either leftover 
uncaptured libraries from WES or genomic DNA, sequenced using an Illumina 
sequencing platform, de-multiplexed and aligned to the reference sequence b37 
edition from the Human Genome Reference Consortium with bwa as described 
previously28. A total of 296 of 304 samples had a mean read depth is 221.4 ×​ and 
met all quality control checkpoints and 99% of samples had a power greater than 
0.996 to detect chromosomal rearrangements.
Chromosomal rearrangement pipeline. Somatic rearrangements were detected using 
four different calling algorithms, BreaKmer78, Lumpy79, dRanger and SvABA80, 
followed by Breakpointer validation, filtering and a CCF estimation module 
(Supplementary Fig. 8a), as described in Supplementary Note.
Consensus clustering of genetic alterations. Generation of gene sample matrix. 
All significant mutated genes (MutSig2CV and CLUMPS, q value ≤​ 0.1 and 
frequency ≥​ 3%), significant regions of SCNAs (GISTIC2.0, q value ≤​ 0.1 and 
frequency ≥​ 3%) and chromosomal rearrangements (frequency ≥​ 3%) were 
assembled into a gene sample matrix (Supplementary Table 8a; non-synonymous 
mutations, 2; synonymous mutations, 1; no-mutation, 0; high-grade CN gain 
[CN ≥​ 3.7 copies], 2; low-grade CN gain [3.7 copies ≥​ CN ≥​ 2.2 copies], 1; CN 
neutral, 0; low-grade CN loss [1.1 ≤​ CN ≤​1.6 copies], 1; high-grade CN loss 
[CN ≤​ 1.1 copies], 2; chromosomal rearrangement present, 3; chromosomal 
rearrangement absent, 0; chromosomal rearrangements not assessed, na).
Assessing bias in individual genetic alterations due to remaining germline and FFPE 
artifacts. Fisher's exact test was applied to each putative genetic driver alteration 
in the gene sample matrix to determine if any of the putative genetic drivers 
occurred more than expected by random chance in tumor-only samples compared 
to patient-matched tumor-normal samples. This analysis revealed no outliers after 
FDR correction, suggesting that there is not a strong bias of remaining germline 
effect in the discovery of CCGs (Supplementary Table 3e and Supplementary 
Fig. 3g). The same Fisher's exact test was applied to assess if a putative driver is 
overrepresented in FFPE tissue compared to fresh-frozen tissue. After calculating 
the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg, one focal amplification, 
21q22.3, was highly significant and the 15 focal amplifications were exclusively 
found in FFPE samples (Supplementary Table 3f and Supplementary Fig. 3m). To 
further investigate the quality of this focal peak, the distribution of the difference 
in amplitude of adjacent targets as a noise measurement was plotted against 
other focal peaks (Supplementary Fig. 3o), where the distribution was found to 
be more irregular and to have the highest s.d. The higher noise level of the focal 
amplification 21q22.3, combined with the fact that it only appeared in FFPE 
samples and the event was exclusively subclonal served as justification for removal 
of the event as a likely FFPE artifact. After the removal of this event, no other 
genetic alterations were significantly overrepresented in FFPE after false discovery 
rate correction (Supplementary Table 3f and Supplementary Fig. 3n).
Non-negative matrix factorization consensus clustering. To robustly identify tumors 
with shared genetic features, we applied a non-negative matrix consensus clustering 
algorithm34 with slight modifications. Briefly, we passed the gene sample matrix 
containing mutations, SCNAs and chromosomal rearrangements (Supplementary 
Table 8a) to the NMF consensus clustering algorithm (input parameters k =​ 4–10) 
bypassing the matrix normalization so that the cluster distance metric depended 
directly on the variant number in the gene-sample matrix. The NMF consensus 
clustering algorithm provided the cluster membership of each sample, the 
cophenetic coefficient for k =​ 4 to k =​ 10 clusters and silhouette values for the 
‘Best cluster’ (k =​ 5) (Supplementary Table 8b). Samples without genetic drivers 
in the input matrix to the clustering were assigned to cluster C0. In addition, 
we identified marker genes associated with each cluster by applying a fisher test 
(2 ×​ 2 table with variant present or absent as one dimension and within-cluster or 
outside-cluster the second dimension) and corrected the P values using the FDR 
procedure (Supplementary Table 8c). Features with a q value ≤​ 0.1 were selected as 
cluster features (Supplementary Table 8c) and visualized as a color-coded heatmap 
using GENE-E (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 12; https://software.broadinstitute.
org/GENE-E/)
Mutual exclusivity/co-occurrence estimations. For each gene of interest, the 
significance of the co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity for each pair of different 
events (mutations, amplification, deletion or structural variant) that affects that 
gene was calculated using a Fisher test, and then corrected for false discovery using 
the Benjamini-Hochberg method.
Inferred timing of genetic alterations. CCF matrix of putative drivers. First, we 
assembled for each of the 158 candidate driver events (for criteria, see generation of 
gene sample matrix above) the cancer cell fraction. When multiple events appeared 
in the same patient, the estimate based on the event with the highest coverage 
was used for mutations and SVs, while the one based on the longest segment was 
used for copy number alterations, as in each case this should represent the best-
measured estimate (Supplementary Table 10a). In addition to the actual CCF value, 
for each genetic feature we added a binary distinction if this is clonal or subclonal 
alteration with 0.9 being the threshold.
Event ordering analysis. To infer the timing of genetic events in each cluster and 
the overall cohort, we applied the method previously described for mutation 
ordering60. Briefly, we first identified for all driver alterations event pairs where 
events occurred such that one event was subclonal and the other was clonal 
(Supplementary Table 10b). The ‘effect-size’ to quantify alteration pairs according 
to clonal and sub-clonal mixtures is simply the difference in counts of clonal and 
subclonal samples. Next, we assumed a null model in which the timing of genetic 
events was random, allowing us to perform a formal binomial test to determine 
if one event was more frequently clonal than the null model (Supplementary 
Table 10c). Of note, we restricted the test to those event pairs that were powered to 
achieve a significant result (q value ≤​ 0.1) when occurring as maximal effect.
Clinical endpoint analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using R v3.3.2 
with additional packages survival v2.41-2 for survival analyses, qvalue v2.6.0 for 
false discovery rate control, and knitr v1.15.1 for reproducible research.
OS was defined as time from treatment until death from any cause. Subjects not 
confirmed dead were censored at the time last known to be alive. PFS was defined 
as time from treatment until the earliest time of progression or death from any 
cause, and censored at time last known to be alive and free of progression.
Univariate and multivariable analyses of time-to-event endpoints were 
performed on the R-CHOP treated cohort (n =​ 259) using Cox regression. Genetic 
features had to be present in at least 3% of samples of the R-CHOP treated cohort 
to be tested for outcome associations. HRs with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and  
Wald P values were reported for model covariates; likelihood-ratio tests and  
P values were reported for multivariable models. Log-likelihoods of nested models 
were compared using a chi-square test to assess improvement in model fits. Median 
event times were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier (KM) and 
reported with 95% CIs; Greenwood's formula was used to approximate the variance 
of KM estimate, and 95% CIs were generated using the log-log transformation. 
Differences in survival curves were assessed using log-rank tests. Median follow-up 
time was estimated using the reverse KM method.
Fisher's exact test was used to test for association between categorical variables. 
ORs and 95% CIs were calculated for binary outcomes from contingency tables 
or logistic regression for continuous predictors. The Wilcoxon or Kruskal-Wallis 
rank-sum test was used to assess a location shift in the distribution of continuous 
variables between two or more than two groups, respectively. Descriptive statistics 
(proportions, medians, etc.) were reported with 95% exact binomial CIs or range. 
All P values were two-sided, and adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing was 
performed using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg; P and q value thresholds 
for significance were set at 0.05 and 0.2, respectively.
Additional methods. Additional quality control metrics, detailed descriptions 
of the estimation of and correction for tumor-in-normal content (deTiN), the

Population characteristics
Our multi-institutional, international group assembled a cohort of 351 patient samples diagnosed with a previously untreated, 
primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of which 304 passed all below described quality controls. This 304 sample dataset 
was obtained from 4 sources: 129 samples from patients enrolled in the prospective, randomized, multi-center RICOVER60 
trial22; 103 samples from a DFCI/BWH cohort; 67 samples from the Mayo Clinic and University of Iowa Specialized Program of 
Research Excellence (SPORE) (51 previously reported WES analysis5,61); and 5 samples from the University of Göttingen, 
Germany.  Forty-four percent (135/304) of samples had a paired normal specimen and 55% (168/304) of samples were obtained 
from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1). All patients had a 
diagnosed primary DLBCL per WHO criteria; this diagnosis was confirmed for all RICOVER60 samples by a central pathological 
review as previously described22, and all DFCI/BWH and Mayo cases were confirmed by an expert hematopathologist (SJR). The 
patient characteristics are equally distributed across the different sources and summarized in Supplementary Table 2. A total of 
85% (259/304) of patients were uniformly treated with state-of-the-art therapy (rituximab-containing CHOP-like regimen) and 
had long-term follow-up (median: 78.5 months). This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute and the IRBs of all other participating institutions. All relevant ethical regulations were followed. 
Informed conset was obtained from the human subjects on clinical trial. Per IRB protocol and approval, written human subject 
cosents were waived for the additional samples.
