Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are caused by multiple mutational processes, 
each of which generates a characteristic mutational signature1. Here, as part of the 
Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium2 of the International 
Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we 
characterized mutational signatures using 84,729,690 somatic mutations from 
4,645 whole-genome and 19,184 exome sequences that encompass most types of 
cancer. We identified 49 single-base-substitution, 11 doublet-base-substitution, 
4 clustered-base-substitution and 17 small insertion-and-deletion signatures. The 
substantial size of our dataset, compared with previous analyses3–15, enabled the 
discovery of new signatures, the separation of overlapping signatures and the 
decomposition of signatures into components that may represent associated—but 
distinct—DNA damage, repair and/or replication mechanisms. By estimating the 
contribution of each signature to the mutational catalogues of individual cancer 
genomes, we revealed associations of signatures to exogenous or endogenous 
exposures, as well as to defective DNA-maintenance processes. However, many 
signatures are of unknown cause. This analysis provides a systematic perspective on 
the repertoire of mutational processes that contribute to the development of human 
cancer.
Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are caused by mutational pro-
cesses of both exogenous and endogenous origin that operate dur-
ing the cell lineage between the fertilized egg and the cancer cell16. 
Each mutational process may involve components of DNA damage or 
modification, DNA repair and DNA replication (which may be normal 
or abnormal), and generates a characteristic mutational signature that 
potentially includes base substitutions, small insertions and deletions 
(indels), genome rearrangements and chromosome copy-number 
changes1. The mutations in an individual cancer genome may have 
been generated by multiple mutational processes, and thus incor-
porate multiple superimposed mutational signatures. Therefore, to 
systematically characterize the mutational processes that contribute to 
cancer, mathematical methods have previously been used to decipher 
mutational signatures from somatic mutation catalogues, estimate 
the number of mutations that are attributable to each signature in 
individual samples and annotate each mutation class in each tumour 
with the probability that it arose from each signature6,9,17–27.
Previous studies of multiple types of cancer have identified more 
than 30 single-base substitution (SBS) signatures, some of known—
but many of unknown—aetiologies, some ubiquitous and others rare, 
some part of normal cell biology and others associated with abnormal 
exposures or neoplastic progression3–5,7–15. Genome rearrangement 
signatures have also previously been described11,25,28–30. However, the 
analysis of other classes of mutation has been relatively limited3,11,31–33.

Mutational signature analysis has predominantly used cancer exome 
sequences. However, the many-fold-greater numbers of somatic muta-
tions in whole genomes provide substantially increased power for 
signature decomposition, enabling the better separation of partially cor-
related signatures and the extraction of signatures that contribute rela-
tively small numbers of mutations. Furthermore, technical artefacts and 
differences in sequencing technologies and mutation-calling algorithms 
can themselves generate mutational signatures. Therefore, the uni-
formly processed and highly curated sets of all classes of somatic muta-
tions from the 2,780 cancer genomes of the PCAWG project2, combined 
with most other suitable cancer genomes (accession code syn11801889, 
available at https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11801889), present 
a notable opportunity to establish the repertoire of mutational signa-
tures and determine their activities across different types of cancer. The 
timing of these signatures during the evolution of individual cancers and 
the repertoire of signatures of structural variation have been explored 
in other PCAWG analyses30,34.
Mutational signature analysis
The 23,829 samples—which include most types of cancer, and comprise 
the 2,780 PCAWG whole genomes2, 1,865 additional whole genomes and 
19,184 exomes—yielded 79,793,266 somatic SBSs, 814,191 doublet-base 
substitutions (DBSs) and 4,122,233 small indels that were analysed for 
mutational signatures, about 10-fold-more mutations than any previ-
ous study of which we are aware (syn11801889)6.
We developed classifications for each type of mutation. For SBSs, the 
primary classification comprised 96 classes (available at https://cancer.
sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/SBS) constituted by the 6 base substi-
tutions C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C and T>G (in which the mutated base is 
represented by the pyrimidine of the base pair), plus the flanking 5′ and 
3′ bases. In some analyses, two flanking bases 5′ and 3′ to the mutated 
base were considered (producing 1,536 classes) or mutations within 
transcribed genome regions were selected and classified according to 
whether the mutated pyrimidine fell on the transcribed or untranscribed 
strand (producing 192 classes). We also derived a classification for DBSs 
(78 classes; available at https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/
DBS). Indels were classified as deletions or insertions and—when of a single 
base—as C or T, and according to the length of the mononucleotide repeat 
tract in which they occurred. Longer indels were classified as occurring 
at repeats or with overlapping microhomology at deletion boundaries, 
and according to the size of indel, repeat and microhomology (83 classes; 
available at https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/ID).
The PCAWG whole-genome sequences, the additional whole-genome 
sequences and the exome sequences were each analysed separately 
(syn11801889)2. Signatures were extracted from each type of cancer 
individually, from all cancer types together, as separate SBS, DBS and 
indel signatures, and as composite signatures of all three types of muta-
tion (Supplementary Note 2).
We used two methods based on nonnegative matrix factorization 
(NMF): SigProfiler, an elaborated version of the framework used for 
the previous ‘Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer’ (COSMIC) 
compendium of mutational signatures (COSMIC v.2, available at https://
cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2)11,17, and SignatureAnalyzer, 
which is based on a Bayesian variant of NMF9,27,35. NMF determines the 
signature profiles and contributions of each signature to each cancer 
genome as part of its factorization of the input matrix of mutation 
spectra. However, with many signatures and/or heterogeneous muta-
tion burdens across samples, the mutations observed in a particular 
sample can be reconstructed in multiple ways—often with small and/or 
biologically implausible contributions from many signatures. There-
fore, each method has developed a separate procedure for estimating 
the contributions of signatures to each sample (Methods).
We tested SignatureAnalyzer and SigProfiler on 11 sets of synthetic 
data (including 64,400 synthetic samples), generated from known 
signature profiles (Methods, Supplementary Note 2). Both methods 
performed well in re-extracting known signatures from realistically 
complex data. Extracted signatures that were discordant from the 
known input usually arose from difficulties in selecting the correct 
number of signatures. The results confirm that use of NMF-based 
approaches for extracting mutational signatures is not a purely algo-
rithmic process, but also requires consideration of evidence from 
experimentally determined mutational signatures and the DNA dam-
age and repair literature, prior evidence of biological plausibility and 
human-guided sensitivity analysis confirming that extractions from 
different groupings of tumours yield consistent results. We used these 
types of evidence and approaches in determining the signature pro-
files reported here. The findings are consistent with results regard-
ing NMF, and the related areas of probabilistic topic modelling and 
latent Dirichlet allocation, in multiple problem domains36,37. It is widely 
understood that the choice of the number of latent variables (for our 
purposes, the number of mutational signatures) is rarely amenable to 
complete automation.
The results from our SigProfiler and SignatureAnalyzer analyses 
of cancer data exhibited many similarities, and we assigned the same 
identifiers to similar signatures extracted using the two methods 
(syn12016215). However, there were also noteworthy differences. 
The numbers of SBS signatures found in PCAWG tumours with a low 
mutation burden (94.4% of cases that contain 47% of mutations) were 
similar: 31 using SigProfiler and 35 using SignatureAnalyzer. However, 
the numbers of additional SBS signatures extracted from hypermutated 
PCAWG samples (5.6% of cases, containing 53% of mutations) were dif-
ferent: 13 using SigProfiler and 25 using SignatureAnalyzer. There were 
also differences in SBS signature profiles, including among signatures 
found in cases with a low mutation burden. The latter primarily involved 
relatively featureless (‘flat’) signatures, which are mathematically chal-
lenging to deconvolute. Finally, there were differences in signature 
attributions to individual samples. SignatureAnalyzer used more sig-
natures to reconstruct the mutational profiles (Extended Data Fig. 1) 
(syn12169204 and syn12177011) and attributions to flat signatures were 
different (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b) (syn12169204). The DBS and indel 
signatures were generally similar between the two methods (Extended 
Data Fig. 2c, d).
The final reference mutational signatures were determined from 
the PCAWG set, supplemented by additional signatures from the other 
datasets (COSMIC, available at https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/
signatures). Each signature was allocated an identifier consistent with, 
and extending, the COSMIC v.2 annotation. Some previous signatures 
split into multiple constituent signatures: these were numbered as in 
the previous annotation, but with additional letter suffixes (for exam-
ple, SBS17 was split into SBS17a and SBS17b). DNA sequencing and 
analysis artefacts also generate mutational signatures. We indicate 
which signatures are possible artefacts but do not present them below 
(full information is available at https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/
signatures). The results of both SignatureAnalyzer and SigProfiler were 
used throughout the study. However, for brevity and for continuity 
with the signature set previously displayed in COSMIC v.2—which has 
been widely used as a reference—SigProfiler results are outlined here, 
and SignatureAnalyzer results are provided in Extended Data Figs. 3, 
4 and at syn11738307.
Single-base substitution signatures
There were substantial differences in the numbers of SBSs between 
samples (ranging from hundreds to millions) and between cancer 
types38 (Fig. 1). In total, 67 SBS mutational signatures were extracted, 
of which 49 were considered likely to be of biological origin (Fig. 2, 
Methods; available at https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/
SBS/). Except for signature SBS25, all signatures reported in COSMIC v.2 
(ref. 6) were confirmed; the median cosine similarity between the newly

derived signatures and those on COSMIC v.2 was 0.95, excluding the 
‘split’ signatures (discussed below). SBS25 was previously found in cell 
lines derived from Hodgkin lymphomas treated with chemotherapy, 
and no primary cancers of this type were available. The newly derived 
signatures showed much improved separation from each other and 
more-distinct signature profiles, as compared with COSMIC v.2 sig-
natures (see ‘Better separation compared to COSMIC v.2 signatures’ 
in Supplementary Note 2 for more information).
Thirteen of the SBS signatures we extracted (excluding those due 
to signature splitting) represent newly identified and probably real 
signatures, not present in COSMIC v.2. Some were rare (SBS31, SBS32, 
SBS35, SBS36, SBS42 and SBS44). Others were more common, but con-
tributed relatively few mutations and/or were similar to previously 
discovered signatures (SBS38, SBS39 and SBS40). Notably, SBS40 is a 
flat signature similar to SBS5. It contributes to multiple types of can-
cer, but its similarity to SBS5 renders the extent of this contribution 
uncertain. For some of the newly identified signatures, there were 
plausible underlying aetiologies (Fig. 3, Extended Data Figs. 4, 5): for 
SBS31 and SBS35, platinum compound chemotherapy39; for SBS32, 
azathioprine therapy; for SBS36, inactivating germline or somatic 
mutations in MUTYH (which encodes a component of the base excision 
repair machinery)40,41; for SBS38, additional effects of exposure to ultra-
violet (UV) light; for SBS42, occupational exposure to haloalkanes13; 
and for SBS44, defective DNA mismatch repair42.
Three previously characterized base substitution signatures (SBS7, 
SBS10 and SBS17) split into multiple constituent signatures (Fig. 2). 
Signature splitting probably reflects the existence of multiple distinct 
mutational processes initiated by the same exposure that have closely—
but not perfectly—correlated activities. We previously regarded SBS7 
as a single signature composed predominantly of C>T at CCN and TCN 
trinucleotides (the mutated base is underlined) together with many 
fewer T>N mutations. It was found in malignant melanomas and squa-
mous skin carcinomas, and is probably due to the UV-light-induced 
formation of pyrimidine dimers, followed by translesion DNA synthesis 
by error-prone polymerases predominantly inserting A opposite to 
damaged cytosines. SBS7 has now been decomposed into four con-
stituent signatures. SBS7a and SBS7b (consisting mainly of C>T at TCN 
and C>T at CCN, respectively) may reflect different pyrimidine-dimer 
photoproducts. SBS7c and SBS7d (consisting predominantly of T>A 
at NTT and T>C at NTT, respectively43) may be due to low frequencies 
of the misincorporation of T and G opposite to thymines in pyrimidine 
dimers. The splitting of SBS10 and SBS17 is described at https://cancer.
sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/SBS/.
Several base substitution signatures showed transcriptional strand 
bias, which may be attributable to transcription-coupled nucleotide 
excision repair acting on DNA damage and/or to an excess of DNA dam-
age on untranscribed strands of genes44. Both mechanisms result in 
more mutations of damaged bases on untranscribed than on tran-
scribed strands of genes. Assuming that either mechanism is respon-
sible for the observed transcriptional strand biases, DNA damage to 
cytosine (SBS7a and SBS7b), guanine (SBS4, SBS8, SBS19, SBS23, SBS24, 
SBS31, SBS32, SBS35 and SBS42), thymine (SBS7c, SBS7d, SBS21, SBS26 
and SBS33) and adenine (SBS5, SBS12, SBS16, SBS22 and SBS25) may 
underlie these mutational signatures (plots of strand bias are available 
at https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/SBS/). The likely 
DNA-damaging agents are known for SBS4 (tobacco mutagens), SBS7a, 
SBS7b, SBS7c and SBS7d (UV light), SBS22 (aristolochic acid), SBS24 
(aflatoxin), SBS25 (chemotherapy), SBS31 and SBS35 (platinum com-
pounds), SBS32 (azathioprine) and SBS42 (haloalkanes).
Using the SBS classification of 1,536 mutation types, which uses the 
sequence context two bases 5′ and two bases 3′ to each mutated base, 
yielded signatures that are largely consistent with those based on sub-
stitutions in trinucleotide contexts. Notably, however, two forms of 
both SBS2 and SBS13 were extracted, one with mainly a pyrimidine and 
the other with mainly a purine at the −2 base (the second base 5′ to the 
mutated cytosine). These may represent the activities of the cytidine 
deaminases APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B, respectively45. If so, APOBEC3A 
accounts for many more mutations than APOBEC3B in cancers with 
high APOBEC activity. Other signatures showed nonrandom sequence 
contexts at +2 and −2 positions (for example, SBS17a, SBS17b and SBS9), 
but sequence context effects were generally much stronger for bases 
immediately 5′ and 3′ to mutated bases.
SBS signatures showed substantial variation in the numbers of can-
cer types and cancer samples in which they were found, and in the 
mutations attributed per cancer sample (Fig. 3). Almost all individual 
cancer samples exhibited multiple signatures, with a mode of three in 
log10(mutations per megabase)

well the mutational spectra of the cancer samples (in PCAWG samples, 
the median cosine similarity was 0.97; 96.3% of samples with cosine 
similarity >0.90): Fig. 4 shows illustrative examples.
Some mutational processes generate base substitutions that cluster 
in small genomic regions. The limited numbers of such mutations may 
result in a failure to detect their signatures using standard methods. We

them separately (Methods). Four main clustered mutational signatures 
were identified (Fig. 2), as previously reported4,27,32. Two, which are found 
in multiple types of cancer, were similar to SBS2 and SBS13 (which have 
been attributed to APOBEC enzyme activity) and represent foci of katae-
gis3,32,46. Two further clustered signatures, one characterized by C>T and 
C>G mutations at (A or G)C(C or T) trinucleotides47 and the other T>A 
and T>C mutations at (A or T)T(A or T), were found in lymphoid neo-
plasms; they probably represent the direct and indirect consequences of 
activation-induced cytidine deaminase mutagenesis and translesion DNA 
synthesis by error-prone polymerases (SBS84 and SBS85, respectively)27.
Doublet-base substitution signatures
Tandem doublet, triplet, quadruplet, quintuplet and sextuplet base 
substitutions (syn11801938 and syn11726620) were observed at about 
1% the prevalence of SBSs. In most cancer genomes, the number of DBSs 
was considerably higher than would be expected from the random 
adjacency of SBSs (syn12177057), indicating the existence of com-
monly occurring, single mutagenic events that cause substitutions 
at neighbouring bases. There was substantial variation in the number 
of DBSs, ranging from 0 to 20,818 in a sample. The numbers of DBSs 
were generally proportional to the numbers of SBSs (Fig. 1), although 
colorectal adenocarcinomas had fewer than expected, and lung cancers 
and melanomas had more (Extended Data Table 1). We extracted eleven 
DBS signatures (Fig. 2, of which three have previously been reported33,48.
Signature DBS1 was characterized by CC>TT mutations (Fig. 2), con-
tributed hundreds to tens of thousands of mutations in malignant mela-
nomas with SBS7a and SBS7b (Fig. 3), exhibited transcriptional strand 
bias consistent with damage to cytosines (syn12177063) and is a known 
consequence of DNA damage induced by UV light33,49. Excluding cancers 
associated with exposure to UV light also yielded a signature (DBS11) 
that was characterized predominantly by CC>TT mutations, but only

contributing tens of mutations in many samples from multiple types 
of cancer (Figs. 2, 3). DBS11 was associated with SBS2, which is due to 
APOBEC activity: APOBEC activity may, therefore, also generate DBS11.
DBS2 was composed predominantly of CC>AA mutations, with 
smaller numbers of CC>AG and CC>AT mutations, and contributed 
hundreds to thousands of mutations in lung adenocarcinoma, lung 
squamous and head and neck squamous carcinomas, which are often 
caused by tobacco smoking33 (Figs. 2, 3). DBS2 showed transcriptional 
strand bias indicative of guanine damage (syn12177064) and was asso-
ciated with SBS4, which is caused by exposure to tobacco smoke. It is 
likely, therefore, that DBS2 can be a consequence of DNA damage by 
tobacco-smoke mutagens.
A signature similar to DBS2 contributed hundreds of mutations to 
liver cancers and tens of mutations to other types of cancer without 
evidence of exposure to tobacco smoke. A pattern resembling DBS2 
also dominates DBSs in healthy mouse cells50. The nature of the muta-
tional processes that underlie these signatures in human cancers that 
are unrelated to smoking, and in healthy mice, is unknown. However, in 
experimental systems, acetaldehyde exposure has been shown to gen-
erate a mutational signature characterized primarily by CC>AA muta-
tions, and lower burdens of CC>AG and CC>AT mutations, together 
with C>A SBSs48. Acetaldehyde is an oxidation product of alcohol and a 
constituent of cigarette smoke. The role of acetaldehyde, and perhaps 
other aldehydes, in generating DBS2 merits further investigation51.
DBS3, DBS7, DBS8 and DBS10 showed hundreds to thousands of muta-
tions in rare colorectal, stomach and oesophageal cancers, some of which 
showed evidence of defective DNA mismatch repair (DBS7 and DBS10) or 
polymerase epsilon exonuclease domain mutations (DBS3) that generate 
hypermutator phenotypes (Figs. 2, 3). DBS5 was found in cancers exposed 
to platinum chemotherapy, and is associated with SBS31 and SBS35.
Small insertion-and-deletion signatures
Indels were usually present at about 10% of the frequency of base 
substitutions (Fig. 1). There was substantial variation between cancer 
genomes in the number of indels, even when cancers with evidence of 
defective DNA mismatch repair were excluded. Overall, the numbers of 
deletions and insertions were similar, but there was variation between 
cancer types: some cancers showed more deletions and others more 
insertions of various subtypes (Fig. 1). We extracted 17 indel mutational 
signatures (Fig. 2).
Indel signature 1 (ID1) was composed predominantly of insertions of 
thymine and ID2 was composed predominantly of deletions of thymine, 
both at long (≥5) thymine mononucleotide repeats (Fig. 2). Tens to 
hundreds of mutations of both signatures were found in most samples 
of most types of cancer, but were particularly common in colorectal, 
stomach, endometrial and oesophageal cancers and in diffuse large B 
cell lymphoma (Fig. 3). Together, ID1 and ID2 accounted for 97% and 
45% of indels in hypermutated and non-hypermutated cancer genomes, 
respectively (Extended Data Table 2). They are probably due to slip-
page of either the nascent (ID1) or template strand (ID2) during DNA 
replication of long mononucleotide tracts.
ID3 was characterized predominantly by deletions of cytosine at 
short (≤5-bp long) mononucleotide cytosine repeats and exhibited 
hundreds of mutations in cancers of the lung, head and neck that are 
associated with tobacco smoking (Figs. 2, 3). There was transcriptional 
strand bias of mutations, with more guanine deletions than cytosine 
deletions on the untranscribed strands of genes, which is compatible 
with transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair of damaged 
guanine (syn12177065 and syn12177066). The numbers of ID3 mutations 
positively correlated with the numbers of SBS4 and DBS2 mutations, 
which we have shown are associated with tobacco smoking (Extended 
Data Figs. 6, 7). Thus, DNA damage by components of tobacco smoke 
probably underlie ID3.
ID13 was characterized predominantly by deletions of thymine at 
thymine–thymine dinucleotides and exhibited large numbers of muta-
tions in malignant melanomas of the skin (Figs. 2, 3). The numbers 
of ID13 mutations correlated with the numbers of SBS7a, SBS7b and 
DBS1 mutations, which we have attributed to DNA damage induced 
by UV light (Extended Data Figs. 6, 7). However, deletions of cytosine

at cytosine–cytosine dinucleotides did not feature strongly in ID13, 
which may reflect the predominance of thymine compared to cytosine 
dimers induced by UV light52.
ID6 and ID8 were both characterized predominantly by ≥5-bp dele-
tions (Fig. 2). ID6 exhibited overlapping microhomology at deletion 
boundaries with a mode of 2 bp (and often longer stretches) and cor-
related with SBS3, which we have attributed to defective homologous-
recombination-based repair (Extended Data Figs. 6, 7). By contrast, ID8 
deletions showed shorter or no microhomology at deletion boundaries 
and did not strongly correlate with SBS3. Both deletion patterns may be 
characteristic of DNA double-strand-break repair by non-homologous-
recombination-based end-joining mechanisms and—if so—this suggests 
that at least two distinct forms are operative in human cancer53.
A small fraction of cancers exhibited very large numbers of ID1 and 
ID2 mutations (>10,000) (Fig. 3) (shown at https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/
cosmic/signatures/ID). These were usually accompanied by SBS6, 
SBS14, SBS15, SBS20, SBS21, SBS26 and/or SBS44, which are associated 
with deficiency in DNA mismatch repair—sometimes combined with 
POLE or POLD1 proofreading deficiency (SBS14 and SBS20)35. Occa-
sional cases with these signatures additionally showed large numbers 
of indels attributed to ID7 (syn11738668), and rare samples showed 
large numbers of ID4, ID11, ID14, ID15, ID16 or ID17 mutations but did 
not show large numbers of ID1 and ID2 mutations or the SBS signatures 
associated with deficiency in DNA mismatch repair.
Correlations with age
A positive correlation between age of cancer diagnosis and the number 
of mutations attributable to a signature suggests that the underlying 
mutational process has been operative (at a more or less constant rate) 
throughout the cell lineage from fertilized egg to cancer cell, and thus in 
the normal cells from which that type of cancer develops6,54. Confirming 
previous reports6,54, the numbers of SBS1 and SBS5 mutations correlate 
with age, and exhibit different rates in different types of tissue (q val-
ues provided in syn12030687, syn20317940 and syn12217988). SBS40 
also correlated with age in multiple types of cancer, although—given 
its similarity to SBS5—misattribution cannot be excluded. DBS2 and 
DBS4 correlated with age; consistent with activity in normal cells and, 
when combined their profiles closely resemble the spectrum of DBS 
mutations found in normal mouse cells50. ID1, ID2, ID5 and ID8 showed 
correlations with age in multiple tissues. ID1 and ID2 indels are probably 
due to slippage at poly T repeats during DNA replication and correlated 
with the numbers of SBS1 substitutions, which have previously been 
proposed to reflect the number of mitoses a cell has experienced6. 
Thus, SBS1, ID1 and ID2 may all be generated during DNA replication 
at mitosis. The number of ID5 mutations correlated with the number 
of SBS40 mutations, and the mutational processes that underlie these 
two age-correlated signatures may therefore contain common compo-
nents. ID8, which is predominantly composed of ≥5-bp deletions with 
no or 1 bp of microhomology at their boundaries, is probably due to 
DNA double-strand breaks repaired by a non-homologous-end-joining 
mechanism. The results indicate that multiple mutational processes 
operate in normal cells.
Discussion
There are important constraints, limitations and assumptions in the 
analytic frameworks used here to characterize mutational signatures. 
Signatures extracted from sample sets in which multiple processes 
are operative remain mathematical approximations, with profiles 
that are potentially influenced by the mathematical approach used 
and other factors. For conceptual and practical simplicity, we assume 
that a single signature is associated with each mutational process and 
provide an average reference signature to represent it. However, we 
do not discount the possibility that further nuances and variations 
of signature profiles exist. We have estimated the contributions from 
each signature to the mutation burden in each sample. However, with 
increasing numbers of signatures and differences of multiple orders 
of magnitude in mutation burdens between some signatures, prior 
knowledge has helped to avoid biologically implausible results. Thus, 
the further development of methods for deciphering and attributing 
mutational signatures is warranted, ideally supported by signatures 
derived from experimental systems in which the causes are known. 
Nevertheless, signatures with many similarities and some differences 
can be found by different mathematical approaches, and these can 
be confirmed in several ways, including experimentally elucidated 
signatures5,31,39,42,43,54–62 and tumours dominated by a single signature 
(syn12016215).
This analysis includes most publicly available exome and whole-
genome cancer sequences. Some rare or geographically restricted 
signatures may not have been captured, signatures conferring limited 
mutation burdens may have been missed and signatures of therapeutic 
mutagenic exposures have not been exhaustively explored. Neverthe-
less, it is likely that a substantial proportion of the naturally occurring 
mutational signatures found in human cancer have now been described. 
This comprehensive repertoire provides a foundation for research into 
the aetiologies of geographical and temporal differences in cancer 
incidence, the mutational processes that operate in healthy tissues 
and non-neoplastic disease states, clinical and public health applica-
tions of signatures and mechanistic understanding of the mutational 
processes that underlie carcinogenesis.

Article
Methods
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The 
experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded 
to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
These online methods contain an abridged description of the meth-
odology used in the current manuscript; extensive details about the 
methodology we used are provided in Supplementary Note 2. Impor-
tantly, two independently developed computational frameworks (Sig-
Profiler and SignatureAnalyzer) based on NMF were applied separately 
to the examined sets of mutational catalogues. SigProfiler and Signa-
tureAnalyzer take different approaches for deciphering mutational 
signatures and for assigning each signature to each sample. By using 
two methods, we aimed to provide a perspective on the effect that dif-
ferent methodologies can have on the numbers of signatures generated, 
signature profiles and attributions. In addition to applying SigProfiler 
and SignatureAnalyzer to cancer data, the tools were also applied to 
realistic synthetic data with known solutions.
Analysis of mutational signatures with SigProfiler
SigProfiler incorporates two distinct steps for identification of muta-
tional signatures, based on the previously described methodology6,11,17 
(Extended Data Fig. 8). The first step (SigProfilerExtraction) encom-
passes a hierarchical de novo extraction of mutational signatures based 
on somatic mutations and their immediate sequence context, and the 
second step (SigProfilerAttribution) focuses on accurately estimating 
the number of somatic mutations associated with each extracted muta-
tional signature in each sample. SigProfilerExtraction is an extension 
of a previous framework for the analysis of mutational signatures11,17. In 
brief, for a given set of mutational catalogues, the algorithm deciphers 
a minimal set of mutational signatures that optimally explains the 
proportion of each mutation type and estimates the contribution of 
each signature to each sample. More specifically, for each NMF itera-
tion, SigProfilerExtraction minimizes a generalized Kullback–Leibler 
divergence constrained for nonnegativity (Supplementary Note 2). The 
algorithm uses multiple NMF iterations (in most cases 1,024) to identify 
the matrix of mutational signatures and the matrix of the activities of 
these signatures, as previously described17. The unknown number of 
signatures is determined by human assessment of the stability and 
accuracy of solutions for a range of values, as previously described17. 
The framework is applied hierarchically to increase its ability to find 
mutational signatures that generate few mutations or are present in 
few samples.
After signatures are discovered by SigProfilerExtraction, SigPro-
filerAttribution estimates their contributions to individual samples. 
For each examined sample, the estimation algorithm involves finding 
the minimum of the Frobenius norm of a constrained function using a 
nonlinear convex optimization programming solver using the interior-
point algorithm63. See Supplementary Note 2 and Extended Data Fig. 
8b for further details.
Analysis of mutational signatures with SignatureAnalyzer
SignatureAnalyzer uses a Bayesian variant of NMF that infers the num-
ber of signatures through the automatic relevance determination tech-
nique and delivers highly interpretable and sparse representations for 
both signature profiles and attributions that strike a balance between 
data fitting and model complexity. Further details of the actual imple-
mentation of the computational approach have previously been pub-
lished9,27,64. SignatureAnalyzer was applied by using a two-step signature 
extraction strategy using 1,536 pentanucleotide contexts for SBSs, 83 
indel features and 78 DBS features. In addition to the separate extrac-
tion of SBS, indel and DBS signatures, we performed a ‘COMPOSITE’ 
signature extraction based on all 1,697 features (1,536 SBS + 78 DBS + 
83 indel). For SBSs, the 1,536 SBS COMPOSITE signatures are preferred; 
for DBSs and indels, the separately extracted signatures are preferred.
In step 1 of the two-step extraction process, global signature extrac-
tion was performed for the samples with a low mutation burden 
(n = 2,624). These excluded hypermutated tumours: those with puta-
tive polymerase epsilon (POLE) defects or mismatch repair defects 
(microsatellite instable tumours), skin tumours (which had intense 
UV-light mutagenesis) and one tumour with temozolomide (TMZ) 
exposure. Because the underlying algorithm of SignatureAnalyzer 
performs a stochastic search, different runs can produce different 
results. In step 1, we ran SignatureAnalyzer 10 times and selected the 
solution with the highest posterior probability. In step 2, additional 
signatures unique to hypermutated samples were extracted (again 
selecting the highest posterior probability over ten runs) while allow-
ing all signatures found in the samples with low mutation burden, to 
explain some of the spectra of hypermutated samples. This approach 
was designed to minimize a well-known ‘signature bleeding’ effect or a 
bias of hyper- or ultramutated samples on the signature extraction. In 
addition, this approach provided information about which signatures 
are unique to the hypermutated samples, which was later used when 
attributing signatures to samples.
A similar strategy was used for signature attribution: we performed a 
separate attribution process for low- and hypermutated samples in all 
COMPOSITE, SBS, DBS and indel signatures. For downstream analyses, 
we preferred to use the COMPOSITE attributions for SBSs and the sepa-
rately calculated attributions for DBSs and indels. Signature attribu-
tion in samples with a low mutation burden was performed separately 
in each tumour type (for example, Biliary–AdenoCA, Bladder–TCC, 
Bone–Osteosarc, and so on). Attribution was also performed separately 
in the combined microsatellite instable tumours (n = 39), POLE (n = 9), 
skin melanoma (n = 107) and TMZ-exposed samples (syn11738314). In 
both groups, signature availability (which signatures were active, or 
not) was primarily inferred through the automatic relevance determi-
nation process applied to the activity matrix H only, while fixing the 
signature matrix W. The attribution in samples with a low mutation 
burden was performed using only signatures found in the step 1 of the 
signature extraction. Two additional rules were applied in SBS signature 
attribution to enforce biological plausibility and minimize a signature 
bleeding: (i) allow SBS4 (smoking signature) only in lung, head and neck 
cases; and (ii) allow SBS11 (TMZ signature) in a single GBM sample. This 
was enforced by introducing a binary, signature-by-sample signature 
indicator matrix Z (1, allowed; 0, not allowed), which was multiplied by 
the H matrix in every multiplication update of H. No additional rules 
were applied to indel or DBS signature attributions, except that sig-
natures found in hypermutated samples were not allowed in samples 
with a low mutation burden.
Application of SigProfiler and SignatureAnalyzer to synthetic 
data
Our goal was to evaluate SignatureAnalyzer and SigProfiler on real-
istic synthetic data to identify any potential limitations of these two 
methods. SignatureAnalyzer and SigProfiler were tested on 11 sets of 
synthetic data, encompassing a total of 64,400 synthetic samples, in 
which known signature profiles were used to generate catalogues of 
synthetic mutational spectra. We operationally defined ‘realistic’ data 
as those based on the characteristics of either SignatureAnalyzer’s or 
SigProfiler’s analysis of the PCAWG genome data. SignatureAnalyzer’s 
reference signature profiles were based on COMPOSITE signatures, 
consisting of 1,536 types of strand-agnostic SBSs in pentanucleotide 
context, 78 types of DBSs and 83 types of small indels, for a total of 
1,697 mutation types. SigProfiler’s reference analysis was based on 
strand-agnostic SBSs in the context of one 5′ and one 3′ base. For each 
test, we generated two sets of realistic data: SigProfiler-realistic (based 
on SigProfiler’s reference signatures and attributions) and Signature-
Analyzer-realistic (based on SignatureAnalyzer’s reference signatures 
and attributions), as well as two other types of data that involved using 
SignatureAnalyzer profiles with SigProfiler attributions and vice versa. 

A detailed description of each of the 11 sets of synthetic data and the 
results from applying SigProfiler and SignatureAnalyzer are provided 
in Supplementary Note 2.
Analysis of clustered mutational signatures
Somatic SBSs were considered clustered if they had intermutational 
distances < 1,000 bp. More specifically, for each sample, an SBS muta-
tional catalogue was generated for substitutions that were <1,000 bp 
from another substitution. Subsequently, the set of SBS mutational 
catalogues containing clustered mutations underwent de novo extrac-
tion of mutational signatures. Any novel mutational signature (one 
that was not previously observed in the complete SBS catalogues) was 
reported as a clustered mutational signature.
Better separation compared to COSMIC v.2 signatures
As described in the manuscript, all mutational signatures previously 
reported in COSMIC v.2 were confirmed in the new set of analyses with 
median cosine similarity of 0.95. However, the separation between 
the COSMIC v.2 mutational signatures (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/
cosmic/signatures_v2) is much worse than the separation between 
the mutational signatures reported here. For example, in COSMIC v.2, 
signatures 5 and 16 had a cosine similarity of 0.90, making them hard 
to distinguish from one another. By contrast, in the current analysis, 
SBS5 and SBS16 have a cosine similarity of 0.65. This allows us to unam-
biguously assign SBS5 and SBS16 to different samples. In the current 
analysis, the larger number of samples has allowed the reduction of 
bleeding between signatures and has given more unique and easily 
distinguishable signatures. One can evaluate the overall separation of 
a set of mutational signatures by examining the distribution of cosine 
similarities between the signatures in the set. The signatures in COS-
MIC v.2 had a median cosine similarity of 0.238. By contrast, the current 
signatures have a much lower median cosine similarity of 0.098. This 
twofold reduction in similarity is highly statistically significant (P value 
9.1 × 10−25) and indicates a better separation between the signatures in 
the current analysis.
Correlations of mutational signature activity with age
Before evaluating the association between age and the activity of a 
mutational signature, all outliers for both age and numbers of muta-
tions attributed to a signature in a cancer type were removed from 
the data. An outlier was defined as any value outside three standard 
deviations from the mean value. A robust linear regression model that 
estimated the slope of the line and whether this slope was significantly 
different from zero (F test; P value < 0.05) was performed using the 
MATLAB function robustfit (https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/
robustfit.html) with default parameters. The P values from the F tests 
were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for false 
discovery rates. Results are available at syn12030687 and syn20317940.

Data availability
Somatic and germline variant calls, mutational signatures, sub-
clonal reconstructions, transcript abundance, splice calls and other 
core data generated by the ICGC and TCGA PCAWG Consortium are 
described in ref. 2, and are available for download at https://dcc.icgc.
org/releases/PCAWG. Additional information on accessing the data, 
including raw read files, can be found at https://docs.icgc.org/pcawg/
data/. In accordance with the data access policies of the ICGC and TCGA 
projects, most molecular, clinical and specimen data are in an open 
tier that does not require access approval. To access information that 
could potentially identify participants, such as germline alleles and 
the underlying sequencing data, researchers will need to apply to the 
TCGA data access committee via dbGaP (https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login) for access to the TCGA portion of the 
dataset, and to the ICGC data access compliance office (http://icgc.org/
daco) for the ICGC portion of the dataset. In addition, to access somatic 
single nucleotide variants derived from TCGA donors, researchers 
will also need to obtain dbGaP authorization. For each mutational 
signature as extracted by SigProfiler, there is a ‘vignette’ that con-
sists of plots and a short textual description at COSMIC (available at 
https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/). Beyond the core 
sequence data generated by the ICGC and TCGA PCAWG Consortium, 
other derived datasets were generated by the research reported in this 
paper. These derived datasets are available at Synapse (https://www.
synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11726601/wiki/513478), and are denoted by 
accession numbers (synXXXXXXXX). All these datasets are mirrored 
at https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/PCAWG/mutational_signatures/ with 
full links, filenames, accession numbers and descriptions as detailed in 
Supplementary Table 1. These datasets include (1) CSV files comprising 
all catalogues of observed mutational spectra that were used as input 
to signature extraction (syn11801889), (2) CSV files and plots of signa-
tures extracted by SigProfiler (syn11738306) and SignatureAnalyzer 
(syn11738307), (3) CSV files with estimates of the numbers of mutations 
generated by each signature in individual tumours (syn11804065), (4) 
estimates of the probability that each signature was responsible for 
each mutational type (for example, CTG>CAG) in individual tumours 
(syn11804068) and (5) synthetic test input data plus the results of 
tests of signature extraction (discovery) on the synthetic test data 
(syn18497223). All derived datasets are open access, and can be down-
loaded without registration or logging in.

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Comparisons between results of SigProfiler and 
SignatureAnalyzer. a, b, Comparison of the attributions for corresponding 
SigProfiler (a) and SignatureAnalyzer (b) signatures. Each one of the SBS 
signatures extracted by SigProfiler and SignatureAnalyzer was paired with the 
signature of highest cosine similarity in the extraction by the other method (if 
one with >0.85 cosine similarity exists). The first column of the plot 
corresponds to the fraction of mutations assigned by one method (summed 
across samples and mutation types) that was also assigned by the other 
method. The remaining mutations were then redistributed to the other 
signatures in the extraction, weighted by their relative probabilities of having 
been generated by each signature and the resulting fraction of mutations was 
then plotted. Signatures on the x axis are shown only if they contribute at least a 
0.1 fraction of mutations to at least one signature on the y axis. c, d, Cosine 
similarities between SigProfiler and SignatureAnalyzer DBS (c) and indel (d) 
signatures. Brown nodes represent SigProfiler signatures; green nodes 
represent SignatureAnalyzer signatures. Matches with cosine 
similarities > 0.8 are shown as edges; the width of the edge indicates the 
strength of the similarity. The locations of the nodes have no meaning. 
Signatures with no matches of >0.8 cosine similarity are shown below. 
SigProfiler ID15 and ID17 were extracted from data that were not analysed by 
SignatureAnalyzer. The suffix ‘P’ on a SignatureAnalyzer signature name 
indicates a signature extracted from non-hypermutated, non-melanoma 
tumours. The suffix ‘S’ on a SignatureAnalyzer signature name indicates a 
signature extracted from hypermutated or melanoma tumours.

A full description is provided in Supplementary Note 2. a, Procedure for 
extracting (discovering) mutational signatures. Step A, apply the approach to a 
set of samples D; initially D contains all samples (that is, D = M). This step has 
previously been described in detail17. Step B, solution evaluation and re-
iteration. Extracted mutational signatures and their activities in individual 
samples are saved into a set (S). The activity of any signature that does not 
increase the cosine similarity of a sample by > 0.01 was removed from the

identified signatures do not explain their patterns (cosine similarity < 0.95). 
The algorithm continues to step C when step A cannot find any stable 
signatures. Step C, clustering of mutational signatures. Hierarchical consensus 
clustering was applied to the set S to derive the consensus mutational 
signatures across the set of samples M. b, Attribution of activities of mutational

Extended Data Table 1 | The number of DBSs is proportional to the number of SBSs, with few exceptions
The exceptions are colorectal adenocarcinoma (Colorect–AdenoCA), lung adenocarcinoma (Lung–AdenoCA), lung squamous cell carcinoma (Lung–SCC) and skin–melanoma, as analysed by 
the following linear regression (computed by an R function call): glm(DBS.count ~ SBS.count + Cancer.Type). This function call fits a model in which the number of DBSs depends linearly on the 
number of SBSs and on the cancer type. P values associated with the coefficients are two-sided.

Sample size
From a statistical perspective this was an exploratory study, and there were no pre-defined hypothesis tests for which sample-size power 
calculations would have been appropriate.  The sample size was determined by numbers of tumour genomes and exomes represented by 
publicly available somatic mutation data. These data consisted of the ICGC Pan Cancer whole genome mutation data, the TCGA MC3 whole 
exome mutation data, and additional mutation data as described in https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11801788.  This was an 
unsupervised analysis, and therefore we extracted as many signatures as possible from all the available data. This enabled a substantial 
increment over previously available sets of mutational signatures, especially with respect to double base substitution (DBS) signatures and 
insertion/deletion (ID) signatures.  
 
For the larger PCAWG Consortium,  the Consortium compiled an inventory of matched tumour/normal whole cancer genomes in the ICGC 
Data Coordinating Centre. Most samples came from treatment-naïve, primary cancers, but there were a small number of donors with multiple 
samples of primary, metastatic and/or recurrent tumours. Our inclusion criteria were: (i) matched tumour and normal specimen pair; (ii) a 
minimal set of clinical fields; and (iii) characterisation of tumour and normal whole genomes using Illumina HiSeq paired-end sequencing 
reads.  
We collected genome data from 2,834 donors, representing all ICGC and TCGA donors that met these criteria at the time of the final data 
freeze in autumn 2014. 
Data exclusions
From a statistical perspective this was an exploratory study, and there were no pre-defined hypothesis tests for which pre-defined data 
exclusion criteria would have been appropriate. Therefore, no data were excluded from analysis by our algorithms. 
 
For the larger PCAWG Consortium,  after quality assurance, data from 176 donors were excluded as unusable. Reasons for data exclusions 
included inadequate coverage, extreme bias in coverage across the genome, evidence for contamination in samples and excessive sequencing 
errors (for example, through 8-oxoguanine).
Replication
This was not an experimental study, and there were no experimental replicates. 
 
For the larger PCAWG Consortium, in order to evaluate the performance of each of the mutation-calling pipelines and determine an 
integration strategy, we performed a large-scale deep sequencing validation experiment. We selected a pilot set of 63 representative tumour/
normal pairs, on which we ran the three core pipelines, together with a set of 10 additional somatic variant-calling pipelines contributed by 
members of the SNV Calling Working Group. Overall, the sensitivity and precision of the consensus somatic variant calls were 95% (CI90%: 
88-98%) and 95% (CI90%: 71-99%) respectively for SNVs. For somatic indels, sensitivity and precision were 60% (34-72%) and 91% (73-96%) 
respectively. Regarding SVs, we estimate the sensitivity of the merging algorithm to be 90% for true calls generated by any one caller; 
precision was estimated as 97.5% - that is, 97.5% of SVs in the merged SV call-set have an associated copy number change or balanced 
partner rearrangement.
Randomization
There were no experimental groups in this study; the question of allocation to experimental groups is not applicable. 
 
For the larger PCAWG Consortium, no randomisation was performed.

Population characteristics
For the PCAWG Consortium data, patient-by-patient clinical data are provided in the marker paper for the PCAWG consortium 
(Extended Data Table 1 of that manuscript). Demographically, the cohort included 1,469 males (55%) and 1,189 females (45%), 
with a mean age of 56 years (range, 1-90 years). Using population ancestry-differentiated single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs), the ancestry distribution was heavily weighted towards donors of European descent (77% of total) followed by East 
Asians (16%), as expected for large contributions from European, North American and Australian projects. We consolidated 
histopathology descriptions of the tumour samples, using the ICD-0-3 tumour site controlled vocabulary. Overall, the PCAWG 
data set comprises 38 distinct tumour types. While the most common tumour types are included in the dataset, their 
distribution does not match the relative population incidences, largely due to differences among contributing ICGC/TCGA groups 
in numbers sequenced.  The non-PCAWG analyses used previously published data.
Recruitment
For the PCAWG Consortium data, patients were recruited by the participating centres following local protocols. 
Ethics oversight
For the PCAWG Consortium data, the Ethics oversight for the PCAWG protocol was undertaken by the TCGA Program Office and
