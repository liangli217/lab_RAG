AR-T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hema-
tologic malignancies, resulting in multiple United States Food 
and Drug Administration approvals since 2017. However, 
long-term responses only persist in roughly half of patients1,2. 
Proposed mechanisms for relapse include tumor resistance to apop-
tosis3,4, target antigen loss5, upregulation of inhibitory receptors and 
intrinsic T cell deficiencies6,7. For patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia, a dearth of specific apheresis and CAR-T subpopulations 
seemed to be important for response7. However, thus far, investiga-
tion of mechanisms of resistance to CAR-T therapy in aggressive 
large B cell lymphomas (LBCL) has been limited.
The first two Food and Drug Administration-approved 
CAR-T cell products for LBCL—axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) 
and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel)—utilize similar CAR designs with 
identical extracellular binding domains. They have, however, dif-
fering manufacturing processes and costimulatory domains (CD28 
and 4-1BB respectively), endowing them with different expansion 
and phenotypic characteristics while maintaining comparable 
clinical efficacy8. CD19 loss has been reported in roughly 30% of 
lymphoma relapses9, suggesting that other factors may explain 
most cases of nonresponse or relapse. A recent study of single-cell 
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data on cellular infusion products 
(IP) from LBCL patients treated with axi-cel identified an associa-
tion between complete clinical response and higher frequencies of 
CD8 T cells expressing memory signatures, whereas poor clinical 
response was associated with CD8 T cell exhaustion10. Much, how-
ever, remains to be understood with respect to how transcriptional 
mechanisms of response vary by product, evolve after infusion 
into the patient, or fit into the broader context of the host immune 
system.
We hypothesized that studying the evolutionary trajectories of 
patient-derived T cells and CAR-T cells from two different CAR 
products would yield insights into their respective modes of suc-
cess or failure. Here, we performed scRNA-seq and single-cell T cell 
receptor (TCR) sequencing of 105 samples from 32 patients with 
LBCL treated with axi-cel or tisa-cel, collected over the course of 
treatment. We found substantial differences in the cellular dynamics 
of response between the two products: tisa-cel responses were asso-
ciated with striking expansion of rare CD8+ central-memory-like 
populations from the IPs, whereas axi-cel treatment revealed less 
shifting of T cell lineages between IPs and post-treatment. In axi-cel 
IPs, we identified increased frequencies of CAR-T regulatory

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Approximately 
half of patients with refractory large B cell lymphomas achieve durable responses from CD19-targeting CAR-T treatment; how-
ever, failure mechanisms are identified in only a fraction of cases. To gain new insights into the basis of clinical response, 
we performed single-cell transcriptome sequencing of 105 pretreatment and post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear 
cell samples, and infusion products collected from 32 individuals with large B cell lymphoma treated with either of two CD19 
CAR-T products: axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) or tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel). Expansion of proliferative memory-like CD8 
clones was a hallmark of tisa-cel response, whereas axi-cel responders displayed more heterogeneous populations. Elevations 
in CAR-T regulatory cells among nonresponders to axi-cel were detected, and these populations were capable of suppressing 
conventional CAR-T cell expansion and driving late relapses in an in vivo model. Our analyses reveal the temporal dynamics of 
effective responses to CAR-T therapy, the distinct molecular phenotypes of CAR-T cells with differing designs, and the capacity 
for even small increases in CAR-T regulatory cells to drive relapse.

(CAR-Treg) cell populations in patients lacking clinical responses. 
We then showed, through in vitro and in vivo modeling, that these 
CAR-Treg cells, expressing either product, can suppress conventional 
CAR-T activity and thus facilitate relapse.
Results
We performed scRNA-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) collected from multiple timepoints from 32 individuals 
with LBCL treated with axi-cel (n = 19) and tisa-cel (n = 13), along 
with their matching IP (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 
2). Patient outcomes were tracked for up to 6 months, with fluo-
rodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scans taken 
for clinical response at around 1, 3 and 6 months postinfusion for 
most patients. We observed 15 of 32 (47%) patients progress or 
relapse within the 6-month window of observation, consistent with 
the known clinical activity of these agents (Fig. 1b). We analyzed 
PBMCs collected within 30 days before treatment (n = 20 total, 
n = 12 at day −30, n = 4 at day −5 and n = 4 on the day of infusion) 
and, to capture peak CAR-T expansion, also at 7 days (D7) after 
treatment (n = 29). When possible, D7 cells were sorted by flow 
cytometry based on expression of CAR to generate an enriched frac-
tion of CAR-T cells (n = 22) (Extended Data Fig. 1a; and Methods). 
Altogether, our cohort yielded a total of 602,577 high-quality cells.
Cells with an in silico detected CAR transcript (Methods) were 
present at high numbers in the IPs and the sorted CAR+ D7 sam-
ples, whereas they were only minimally detected in the sorted CAR– 
fractions and unsorted samples from D7 post-treatment samples 
(Fig. 1c). In pretreatment samples, we only artifactually detected the 
CAR transcript in 73 of 131,000 cells (0.0006%).
Clustering of all cells in our dataset enabled the identification 
of diverse immune cell types present based on canonical markers 
(Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Such analysis revealed D7 
non-CAR-T cells to intersperse with those from baseline, whereas 
D7 CAR+ cells tended to cluster separately from the baseline and 
the D7 CAR– cells and IPs clustered independently (Fig. 1d). Most 
clusters, and in particular the non-T cell clusters, spanned the 
patients, indicating that there was less variability among patients 
than among types of cells (Fig. 1d). We observed distinct cluster-
ing of the CAR+ cells originating from the IP cells, as well as the 
D7 CAR-sorted samples (Fig. 1e). As expected, the IP samples and 
D7 CAR+ samples consisted primarily of T cells, whereas baseline 
and D7 CAR– samples contained other populations such as mac-
rophages, myeloid, dendritic cells and B cells (Fig. 1d). We did 
not detect extensive transcriptional differences among cells from 
patients treated with tisa-cel versus axi-cel at baseline (Fig. 1d). 
However, cells from the IPs and D7 samples seemed to cluster by 
CAR construct and expression, suggesting potential CAR-driven 
differences in their phenotype (Fig. 1e).
Transcriptomic evolution of CAR-T cells from IP to D7. To 
explore molecularly the observed separation between transduced 
CAR-T cells and untransduced T cells, we devised a pseudobulk 
differential expression approach, which has been shown to help 
avoid inflated test statistics associated with repeatedly measuring 
many cells from a comparatively small number of patients11. We 
performed in silico sorting of cells of each sample into popula-
tions of interest (CD4/CD8, CAR/non-CAR) and then aggregated 
transcripts across all cells of a particular cell type to yield a sample 
by gene matrix of transcript counts as one might obtain from bulk 
sequencing (Fig. 2a; and Extended Data Fig. 1c; and Methods).
At D7, we found 463 genes to be elevated (false discovery rate 
(FDR) < 10%, >twofold increase in CAR+ cells relative to CAR–) 
in both types of CAR-transduced T cells (Supplementary Table 3), 
including genes related to cellular proliferation (DIAPH3, BUB1B, 
KIF23, FDR-corrected P value (Q) < 10−5 for both products) and 
activation (for example, CD109 with log2 fold change (LFC) = 1.3, 
Q = 2.1 × 10−7 and LFC = 2.4, Q = 1.0 × 10−7 for tisa- and axi-cel, 
respectively). Additional genes were found in product-specific 
analyses, such as increased expression of CTLA4 in axi-cel IPs 
(LFC = 2.3, Q = 5.0 × 10−5; Fig. 2b).
Our analysis of tisa-cel IPs yielded just one significant hit 
(Q < 0.1), likely due to power limitations from the lower CAR tran-
script detection rate compared with axi-cel (Fig. 1c and Fig. 2b): 
ENPP2 (LFC = 1.09, Q = 0.02), which is associated with a 4-1BB sig-
nature12. Indeed, we found genes of this signature to be recurrently 
upregulated in tisa-cel IPs over axi-cel (Fig. 2c). We observed a sub-
set of these genes maintained expression at D7 (genes in the MHC II 
pathway), whereas others (such as the transcription factor-encoding 
BATF3) were transiently expressed in the IP but downregulated 
posttransfusion.
To further map out these temporal transcriptional changes, we 
calculated differentially expressed genes between IP and D7 for 
each product separately (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 4). Some 
of the upregulated genes found exclusively in one product reflected 
known differences between CD28 and 4-1BB signaling in tisa-cel 
and axi-cel. Consistent with rapid activation associated with CD28 
signaling, CD8+ axi-cel cells showed stronger upregulation of acti-
vation marker PDCD1 (refs. 13–15) (PD-1, LFC = 2.74 D7 relative 
to IP, Q = 6.2 × 10−7) and checkpoint regulator SLAMF6 (Fig. 2e; 
LFC = 1.74, Q = 6.4 × 10−7), perhaps suggestive of an early exhaus-
tion signature in this rapidly expanding product16. We also observed 
upregulation of SOS1 in the IP of axi-cel, which is associated with 
CAR proliferation17 (LFC = −1.97, Q = 4.8 × 10−7).
We identified 1,442 differentially expressed genes shared 
between the products (708 upregulated and 734 downregulated by 
at least twofold in D7 samples compared with IP with Q < 0.1). This 
included ZBP1 (tisa-cel LFC = 5.7 and Q = 5.1 × 10−9, and axi-cel 
LFC = 3.7 and Q = 1.7 × 10−10), which plays an important role in 
mediating necroptosis in response to interferon-exposed cells18, 
suggestive of potential upregulation of activation-induced cell 
death pathways in both products at this timepoint. ZBP1-deficient 
mice resist systemic inflammation driven by elevations in inter-
feron (IFN)γ signaling, suggesting a potential pathway for regu-
lation of CAR toxicity18,19. Genes lowered in expression at D7 
included (1) IRF4 (tisa-cel LFC = −1.8, Q = 2.0 × 10−9, and axi-cel 
LFC = −1.8, Q = 3.4 × 10−8) implicated in prevention of exhaustion 
in the CAR-T cells of in vivo cancer models20; and (2) CISH (tisa-cel 
LFC = −5.6, Q = 9.8 × 10−13,and axi-cel LFC = −5.3, Q = 4.5 × 10−11), 
which has been identified as encoding a critical T cell immune 
checkpoint, the ablation of which results in enhanced T cell func-
tion mediated through the TCR21.
Associations of cell subsets with clinical response. We next que-
ried our dataset for cell types with frequencies associated with clini-
cal response, defined by whether progressive disease was observed 
by PET within 6 months of follow up (Methods). Among the 
CAR– PBMCs, we used the method scCODA22 to test whether any 
non-T cell populations changed in frequency relative to the num-
ber of T cells. We included as covariates treatment product and, for 
baseline analyses, the timepoint of sampling (days 0, −5 or −30), 
as we observed that T cell fractions were higher in day 0 samples 
(Extended Data Fig. 1d). Other factors such as baseline tumor vol-
ume were not observed to associate (Extended Data Fig. 1e). We 
identified monocytes as more abundant in nonresponders at base-
line for both products (FDR = 0.02, estimated LFC of 0.77 with a 
95% high density interval of (0.24,1.31) between nonresponders and 
responders; Extended Data Fig. 2a), in agreement with previously 
described results23. This effect was not observed at D7, nor were any 
other non-T cell populations found to be significantly altered.
Assessing whether the relative fractions of CD4+ and CD8+ 
subsets were associated with response, we found that in patients 
treated with tisa-cel, but not axi-cel, response was associated with

the extent to which D7 CAR+ cells were predominantly (>50%) of 
CD8+ subtype (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 2b,c; likelihood ratio 
test P = 0.02 and P = 0.51 for tisa-cel and axi-cel, respectively). Five 
out of seven tisa-cel treated patients with lower proportion (<50%) 
of CD8+CAR+ T cells at D7 exhibited progressive disease by day 30, 
and the remaining two relapsed 6 months following treatment. In 
contrast, only one out of six patients (Tisa-N-31) with greater than 
50% CD8+CAR-T cells at D7 exhibited progressive disease. The 
percentage of CD8+ cells in tisa-cel IPs was low in both respond-
ers and nonresponders, but had a modest association with 6-month 
response (Extended Data Fig. 2b; Q = 0.11).
The temporal dynamics of these CD8 fractions from IP to D7 
were strikingly different between the two treatments. In axi-cel, 
the fraction of D7 CAR+ T cells that were CD8+ was variable across 
patients, and this value was highly correlated with the percentage of 
CD8+ cells in the IP (Fig. 3b; Spearman 𝝆 = 0.73, P = 0.002). Tisa-cel

IPs, however, were universally composed of less than 10% CD8+ 
cells, but these CD8+ cells dramatically expanded at D7, particularly 
in patients exhibiting long-term response (Fig. 3b). The reduced 
expansion in nonresponders was seen for patients with CD19 posi-
tive and negative relapse alike (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Baseline 
fractions of CD8+ cells were found to be predictive of neither those 
observed in the circulating CAR– T cell populations nor in the 
IPs (Fig. 3b).

Fig. 3 | Temporal evolution of T cells in responders and nonresponders of different products. a, Kaplan–Meier response curves stratified by whether 
patients had greater than 50% CD8 CAR-T cells (out of all CAR-T cells) at D7. P values testing the significance of this stratification using a Cox 
proportional-hazards model are shown. b, Changes in CD8 frequency between different timepoints for CAR– and CAR+ cells. c, Fraction of cycling cells at 
different timepoints for different CD4/CD8 designations, treatments and response outcomes. A two-tailed t-test is shown for tisa-cel CD8+ IPs comparing 
responders and nonresponders (P = 0.007, t-statistic = −4.3, n = 4 and n = 3 for responders and nonresponders, respectively). Individual samples are shown 
as dots, and a line is drawn showing the mean of each timepoint, with an error band showing a 95% confidence interval derived from bootstrapping 1,000 
iterations. d, Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes in CD8+CAR-T cells between responders and nonresponders for each product and timepoint. 
P values were calculated with the limma package two-tailed test of moderated t-statistics. All genes with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR-corrected P values 
Q < 0.25 are colored and labeled (plotted values are uncorrected). The area of each dot is the absolute value of the LFC times the negative log10 P value.  
e, PCA dimensionality reduction using knn-smoothed expression of T differentiation markers (CD45RO, CD45RA and CCR7) visualizing the classification 
of T cell subtypes. Dotted lines represent where the cutoffs used to define CCR7+ and CD45RA+ (smoothed expression values >0.5) fall in the projection. 
f, Depiction of T subset frequencies at each timepoint for each product and response. Bar widths at each timepoint are proportional to the fraction of cells 
(out of all cells) being classified as a particular subset. CD4 and CD8 cells are stratified, and distinguished with cross-hatching for CD4 subsets.

for cell cycle gene sets24, and calculated the fraction of cycling 
CAR-T cells at each timepoint. A higher fraction of cells at a single 
timepoint in the S and G2/M phases is suggestive that, as a whole, 
cells in the population are moving faster through G0/G1 (ref. 25), 
which is the main determinant of proliferation rate. Tisa-cel 
CD4+CAR-T cells exhibited fractions of cycling cells comparable 
with those of CD8+ cells in the IP but essentially no CD4+ cells were 
dividing at D7 (Fig. 3c), explaining the outgrowth of CD8+ cells. 
Responders had higher fractions proliferating CD8+ cells in their 
IPs (two-tailed t-test P = 0.007), likely underlying the greater expan-
sion seen at D7. Meanwhile, axi-cel CD4+CAR-T cells exhibited 
similar proliferation rates to CD8+ cells both in the IP and at D7, 
consistent with them maintaining similar ratios across timepoints.
By testing for genes associated with response in our pseudobulk 
framework, we found that most differentially expressed genes (14 
out of 17 genes with FDR < 10%) were in the CD8+ cells of tisa-cel 
IPs (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 5). Nonresponders showed 
an activated cytotoxic phenotype, with upregulation of genes such 
as PRF1 (perforin), GZMH and LAG3. Thus, further differentiation 
of these cells provides a possible explanation for the lower prolifera-
tion and failure of expansion in nonresponders. We did not observe 
differential expression when studying CD8+ axi-cel IPs. Prior work10 
studying axi-cel IPs had proposed dysfunctional and memory genes 
characteristic of nonresponders and responders, respectively, but 
examining these genes in our data did not yield a significant separa-
tion of patients by response (Extended Data Fig. 3).
To better characterize the differentiation states of these cells, we 
developed an expectation–maximization-based method to estimate 
CD45RA and CD45RO isoform expression from 5′ scRNA data 
(Extended Data Fig. 4a,b; and Methods). We found in published 
PBMC datasets with additional feature barcoding of CD45 iso-
forms that our RNA-based measurements of these isoforms were 
highly concordant to the surface protein measurements (Extended 
Data Fig. 4c), and could be used to define T cell subsets similar to 
those from the protein-derived data (Extended Data Fig. 4d–f). 
We used smoothed expression of these and other common T cell 
subset markers (Supplementary Table 6; and Methods) to clas-
sify the cells into naive (CCR7+CD45RA+), central memory (CM, 
CCR7+CD45RO+), effector memory (EM, CCR7–CD45RO+), ter-
minally differentiated effector memory re-expressing CD45RA 
(EMRA, CCR7–CD45RA+) and regulatory T cells (FOXP3+) (Fig. 3e 
and Extended Data Figs. 4g and 5a–d). We further distinguished 
CD4+ cytotoxic cells (CD4+CTLs, NKG7+), prevalent in our dataset, 
from other EMs with a more typical helper phenotype (Extended 
Data Fig. 5b,d).
Tisa-cel IPs were composed primarily of CD4+ cells with a mix 
of CM and EM phenotypes, with a modest elevation of CMs in non-
responders compared with responders (Fig. 3f; median of 24% and 
56% cells for responders and nonresponders, respectively; two-sided 
t-test P = 0.084). We observed very few cells classified as Naive in 
either product (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 4g), in contrast to the 
median of 13.9% seen in the pivotal axi-cel trial26, though consistent 
with other studies of these products27,28. Due to the stimulation of IP 
cells during the course of manufacturing, CD45RA expression may 
be modulated to an extent that would affect the classification of cells 
as CM or Naive, particularly when comparing protein-based with 
our RNA-based methods.
At D7, CMs were largely replaced by EMs for both products, 
including CD4+CTLs in three of eight of the nonresponding 
tisa-cel-treated patients (and seen in zero of five responders). The 
previously noted post-treatment expansion of CD8+ cells in tisa-cel 
took on a primarily CCR7–CD45RO+ EM phenotype regardless 
of response. We observed cells beginning to re-express CD45RA 
(EMRA) in several patients (Extended Data Fig. 5e), although 
other markers of terminal differentiation were not seen to be ele-
vated (Extended Data Fig. 5f), suggesting they may retain func-
tions similar to EMs. In axi-cel-treated patients, an expansion of 
CD4+CTLs was also seen following treatment (median of 9.2% and 
30% of cells in IP and D7 CAR-T populations respectively, t-test 
P = 0.0032) in responders and nonresponders alike. CAR– cells in 
patients treated with either treatment were a mix of EM and EMRA 
phenotypes, which remained unchanged in frequency from base-
line to post-treatment (Fig. 3f). T cell subset frequencies at baseline 
were heterogeneous across patients and mostly not associated with 
tumor burden or timepoint, with the exception of a depletion of 
TEMRA cells at day 0 (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g; FDR-corrected rank 
sum Q = 0.02).
To further dissect these populations in an unsupervised man-
ner, we performed clustering of IP and D7 CAR-T cells for each 
treatment and clinical outcome (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). 
CD8+ tisa-cel IP cells demonstrated a considerable shift in their dis-
tribution across the identified clusters when comparing responders 
and nonresponders (Fig. 4b; log likelihood ratio 20.3, Benjamini–
Hochberg-corrected Q = 0.060; and Methods). Tisa-cel responders 
had more cells from the cluster expressing CM markers CCR7 and 
LEF1 (two-tailed t-test P = 0.0057; Fig. 4c,d), and expressed the tran-
scription factor STAT1. Nonresponders had higher frequencies of 
cells in cluster EM 1 (two-tailed t-test P = 0.0062) with markers sim-
ilar to those observed in our pseudobulk analysis: interferon gamma 
(IFNG), perforin (PRF1) and markers of activation/exhaustion 
LAG3 and HAVCR2 (TIM-3) (Fig. 4c,d). While overall a shift in the 
subtypes of CD8+ tisa-cel CAR-Ts at D7 was not observed (log like-
lihood ratio 0.34, Q  =  0.98), we found that the only nonresponder 
that more than 50% CD8+ cells of their CAR-T cells post-treatment 
(Tisa-N-31) had a phenotype distinct from that of responders in our 
dataset (Fig. 4e,f). Their cells were distinguished by high expression 
of KLRG1 and lack of L-selectin (SELL)—a phenotype attributed 
to short-lived effector cells (SLECs)29. Thus these CD8+ cells may 
not have had the correct phenotype to induce an effective response. 
This patient had a CD19 positive relapse (Supplementary Table 1), 
ruling out antigen loss as a potential explanation. The cells of most 
responders fell into an IL7R+EM 1 cluster, with the exception of

one patient (Tisa-R-22) with a unique CX3CR1+CD27+ phenotype 
(Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6b; cluster EM 2).
We next used our TCR enrichment libraries to track the tem-
poral evolution of the CAR-T phenotypes. In all tisa-cel respond-
ers (and several nonresponders), the top CD8+ TCR clones in the 
IP were found to be increased in frequency at D7 (Extended Data 
Fig. 6c). In responders, the cluster membership of these clones 
showed that they originated primarily from CMs in the IP and dif-
ferentiated into IL7R+ EMs at day 7 (Fig. 4g). Meanwhile, clones 
with a SLEC phenotype at D7 were inferred to have differentiated 
from the nonresponse-associated GZMB+PRF1+ EM population. 
Axi-cel again showed starkly different dynamics, where CM pheno-
type cells in the IPs exhibited fewer cells in the cell cycle than other 
IP subsets, and were not observed to be the primary origin of the 
CAR-T cells present at D7 (Fig. 4g), suggesting a less predominant 
role, at least initially, of these cells compared with tisa-cel.
Finally, we identified a population of Treg cells with CAR tran-
scripts present (CAR-Treg cells) in the IPs, a rare subset of CD4+ 
circulating lymphocytes that play a critical role in preventing auto-
immunity30 but facilitate an immunosuppressive tumor micro-
environment in a variety of tumor types, including aggressive 
lymphomas31–35. However, CAR-Treg cells have not yet been shown to 
play a role in clinical relapse after CAR-T cell treatment. Analyzing 
tisa-cel and axi-cel IPs together with batch correction for interprod-
uct differences, we found CAR-Treg cells were significantly rarer in 
tisa-cel IPs than in axi-cel (Fig. 5a; median 0.3% of all CAR+ cells 
in tisa-cel versus 2.7% in axi-cel, two-tailed t-test P = 1.3 × 10−4). 
Frequencies of Treg cells at baseline were comparable between 
patients treated with the two products (Extended Data Fig. 7a; 
median of 3.1% and 2.6% of axi-cel and tisa-cel respectively, t-test 
P = 0.21), suggesting this is not due to pre-existing differences in the 
patient populations. We also observed other classic markers of Treg 
cells among the top differentially expressed genes including IL2RA 
(CD25) and CTLA4 (Extended Data Fig. 7b), providing additional 
evidence these are genuine Treg cells.
We found that, in axi-cel CAR-Treg cells in IPs, this population 
had increased frequency in nonresponders (Fig. 5a; two-tailed t-test 
P = 0.013, median of 5.1% and 2.5% with ranges of 2.2–8% and 
0–3.7% in nonresponders and responders, respectively). T cells with-
out a detected CAR had lower fractions of Treg cells (median 0.6%), 
and they were present at a higher median level in nonresponders 
(Extended Data Fig. 7a; median 1.5% versus 0.4%, t-test P = 0.082). 
However, due to the lack of definitive flow cytometric isolation of 
such CAR-negative cells from our IP samples and the sparsity of 
scRNA-sequencing data, this increase in nonresponders could be 
due to contamination by CAR-transduced cells for which we did not 
detect a CAR transcript. In exploring an external single-cell data-
set10 of axi-cel IPs, we also found a trend towards higher Treg cells 
in nonresponders (Fig. 5b; two-tailed t-test P = 0.17). Most striking 
were several nonresponders with very high CAR-Treg frequencies, 
up to 26.7% of all CAR+ cells (range 4.5–10.3% for responders, and 
3.7–26.7% for nonresponders).
CAR-Treg cells drive lymphoma relapse in vivo. To assess whether 
CAR-Treg cells could drive resistance in aggressive lymphomas at the 
proportions observed in the IPs, we pursued in vitro and in vivo 
modeling. We isolated bulk-CD3+ conventional T cells (Tconv), Treg 
cells and CD4+ T cells from healthy donor peripheral blood, and

transduced these populations with either CD28 or 4-1BB costimu-
lated second-generation CD19-targeted CAR constructs (Fig. 5c 
and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). By carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl 
ester staining of the bulk population, a population of 25% CAR-Treg 
cells reduced CAR-Tconv expansion compared with CAR-CD4 con-
trols for both constructs (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). To assess the 
contribution of CAR-Treg cells to relapse in an in vivo model of lym-
phoma, we subjected NSG mice engrafted with JeKo-1 lymphoma 
cells to injection of CAR-T cells composed of 100% CAR-Tconv, or 
75% CAR-Tconv with either 25% CAR-CD4 or 25% CAR-Treg cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 8a; Methods). All mice seemed to rapidly 
clear tumor by day 3 (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). However, for both 
constructs, the overall numbers of CAR-Tconv cells in the periph-
eral blood at day 14 were suppressed in the CAR-Treg treated mice 
(Extended Data Fig. 8d,e), and most of the mice treated with prod-
ucts containing CAR-Treg cells relapsed, whereas none of the con-
trol mice had at the time of euthansia on day 35 (Extended Data 
Fig. 8f,g). Quantification of CAR-Tconv cells in the spleen at the time 
of euthanasia revealed high levels in the CAR-CD4-control mice 
and minimal levels of CAR-Tconv in the mice treated with injections 
containing CAR-Treg cells (CD28 median 37.0 versus 2.3, P = 0.007; 
4-1BB median 54.1 versus 0.6, P = 0.0003, Extended Data Fig. 8h–k).
After demonstrating that 25% CAR-Treg cells were sufficient to 
drive relapse, we next wanted to ascertain whether a lower, more 
physiologically relevant proportion of CAR-Tregs (as seen in our 
cohort) could also drive relapse. We engrafted NSG mice with 
JeKo-1 lymphoma cells followed by injection of CAR-T cells 7 days 
later, composed of 95% CAR-Tconv with either 5% CAR-CD4, or 5% 
CAR-Treg cells (Fig. 5d). Again, after apparent early tumor clearance 
in all mice by day 3, all CAR-Treg mice developed frank relapse after 
extended follow up, whereas no relapses were seen in control mice 
(Fig. 5e–h). Assessment of peripheral blood CAR-Tconv expansion at 
day 21 revealed suppression in the CAR-Treg treated mice relative to 
control mice (CD28 median 8.7 versus 2.0, P = 0.0012; 4-1BB 14.4 
versus 0.9 P = 0.0091; Fig. 5i,j). At the time of euthansia, splenic 
CD3 staining was markedly reduced in all CAR-Treg mice by immu-
nohistochemical staining and flow cytometry (CD28 median 59.8 
versus 0.68 P = <0.0001, 4-1BB median 57.1 versus 0.12, P < 0.0001; 
Fig. 5k–n). Thus, CAR-Treg cells making up merely 5% of total 
infused CAR-T cells were sufficient to drive late tumor relapses and 
suppress CAR-Tconv expansion.
Differential CAR-T populations in patient with reinfusion. 
One of the study subjects (Tisa-N-29) who received tisa-cel had 
a CD19+ relapse 6 months after treatment. This patient was sub-
sequently treated with a second infusion of the same IP and then 
achieved clinical and radiographic complete remission (last follow 
up 215 days after infusion; Fig. 6a).
PBMCs collected 7 days after retreatment as well as the read-
ministered IP were analyzed by scRNA-seq as before (Fig. 6b). As 
expected, the two IP products lacked any discernible differences 
in cellular composition (Fig. 6b,c). In contrast, CAR-T cells at D7 
following each of the treatments exhibited marked differences. 
While few (5%) CD8+CAR-T cells were detectable 7 days after the 
initial infusion, around 30% (a sixfold increase) was observed after 
the second (Fig. 6d)—a finding confirmed by parallel flow cytom-
etry measurements (Fig. 6d,e). Between the two infusions, no dif-
ferences in phenotype were found in the postinfusion circulating 
CD8+CAR-T cells, although statistical power for this comparison 
was limited by the low frequency of CD8+ T cells after the first treat-
ment. On the other hand, the phenotype of CD4+CAR-T cells shifted 
strikingly from one treatment to the other (Fig. 6c,f). The CAR-T cells 
had a CTL phenotype after the first infusion, with top differen-
tially expressed genes including markers of cytotoxicity (GZMK, 
GZMB, GZMH, NGK7), the transcription factor IRF8 and the gene 
TOX, implicated previously in T cell exhaustion36. In contrast, 
CD4+ cells after the second infusion instead expressed genes more 
consistent with a helper phenotype such as TNFRSF4 (encoding the 
costimulatory molecule OX40) and Th2-marker CCR4.
Differences were also observed in the non-CAR compartment, 
with the first post-treatment sample being composed of almost 
exclusively CD8+ T cells, whereas the second additionally con-
tained myeloid and natural killer cells (Fig. 6b and Extended Data 
Fig. 9a,b). The CD8+ non-CAR-T cells exhibited substantial dif-
ferences in expression between the two timepoints. After the first 
treatment, these cells expressed CD27 and CXCR3. After the second 
they expressed higher levels of transcription factor-encoding genes 
GATA3 and TBX21 (t-bet) and increased levels of GNLY (Extended 
Data Fig. 9c).
Discussion
CD19 CAR-T therapy has provided a cure to roughly 40% of 
patients with previously incurable lymphomas26,37, but the fail-
ure modes in the remaining patients remain incompletely under-
stood38–40. Our study provides important observations of temporal 
changes in clonal and expression dynamics of the two main CD19 
CAR-T designs in use for LBCL (Extended Data Fig. 10). Tisa-cel 
responses were associated with expansion of central-memory CD8 
populations—a phenomenon not seen in axi-cel. Curiously we did 
not observe the same associations of CM and exhaustion pheno-
types with response to axi-cel as found in a previous study10. Larger 
cohorts will be needed to understand whether this is due to the still 
relatively small sample sizes attainable with scRNA-seq, or the result 
of genuine differences in the patient populations or clinical prac-
tices of our respective hospitals.
A striking feature of our data is the divergent phenotypes and 
apparent response mechanisms of the two products. The two 
products have differing designs (4-1BB versus CD28 costimula-
tion, CD8 versus CD28 transmembrane for tisa-cel versus axi-cel), 
are delivered by different vectors and have differing manufactur-
ing processes41 (fresh versus frozen apheresis products, activation 
by antibody-coated beads versus soluble antibody and cytokines), 
although the precise details remain proprietary. Understanding pre-
dictive molecular features of response specific to each product will 
give insights to further optimize their design and manufacturing, 
and may help identify which product is most likely to succeed in a 
given patient.
Apart from the CAR-T cells themselves, our case where read-
ministration of a second infusion of the same tisa-cel IP to a patient 
resulted in expansion of different immune cell populations after each 
treatment highlights the importance of CAR-T-extrinsic pheno-
types in response. How important is the host immunological milieu 
for CAR-T cell therapy and to what extent can we optimize it? Do 
the stochastics of infusing individual unique cells matter more than 
previously thought? Tumor-intrinsic factors such as overall disease 
burden may also play a role; however, in this case, tumor burden 
was higher upon the second infusion (Supplementary Table 1; sum 
of the product diameters values of 37.2 and 58.9 cm2 for the first and 
second dose, respectively). Retrospective studies of patients who 
have received multiple infusions suggest that this successful rein-
duction of remission is rare42.
Finally, we found that increases in infusional CAR-Treg cells are 
associated with nonresponse to axi-cel treatment, and demonstrate 
that similar trends exist in data from a previous study of axi-cel 
products10. In vivo modeling suggests that this may be sufficient to 
drive late relapses and suppression of CAR-Tconv expansion in lym-
phoma, demonstrating that small numbers of CAR-Treg cells are 
capable of driving clinical relapse. Depletion of Treg cells using CD25 
selection has been performed at clinical scale in the context of an 
autologous stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma43, suggesting 
that such a step could be added to traditional CAR-T manufactur-
ing pipelines. Additionally, whereas in vivo modeling demonstrated

that CAR-Treg cells incorporating either costimulatory domain could 
cause relapse, we observed substantially lower numbers of CAR-Treg 
cells in tisa-cel products. As axi-cel manufacturing begins from 
fresh apheresis cells whereas tisa-cel is derived from frozen cells, we 
speculate that cryopreservation may serve as a crude depletion of 
Treg cells, which are notoriously intolerant of freezing44–46.
We note several aspects not examined by our current manu-
script, including the impact of different times of peak expansion 
(median of 7 and 9 days for axi-cel and tisa-cel), as well as lengths 
of persistence, with axi-cel rapidly declining while tisa-cel can be 
detected for months or years after infusion, particularly in respond-
ers26,37,47. Furthermore our study was limited to blood, and future 
investigation of lymph node biopsies and analysis of tumor-CAR-T 
interactions remains a fruitful avenue for research.
In summary, we have profiled the transcriptomic evolution of 
immune cells over the course of treating refractory LBCLs with the 
first two CD19 CAR-T products. It is our hope that through illumi-
nation of the response-associated characteristics of each treatment 
we can optimize the design of CAR-T therapies, match patients with 
the treatments most likely to induce a clinical response and under-
stand strategies for combating relapse.

Methods
Patient samples and cell preparation. All patients were treated with commercial 
CAR-T cell products; clinical data and blood samples were obtained after written 
informed consent under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol at 
the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DFHCC No. 16-206 and 17-561). We 
complied with all relevant ethical regulations for human research participants. 
No compensation was provided for participation. Demographic information (age 
and gender) are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Responders were defined as 
those without radiographic relapse by 6 months of follow up. Nonresponders were 
defined as patients whose disease either did not have an initial response at day 28 
or who progressed before the 6-month follow up window. Infusion products were 
collected from the remnants of infusion bags and cryopreserved in a solution of 
10% dimethylsulfoxide in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Tumor burden was assessed 
using sum of the product diameters, which is based on revised International 
Working Group response criteria for malignant lymphoma49,50 and has previously 
been utilized for tumor burden assessment in lymphoma patients treated with 
CAR-T cell therapy26,51.
Cryopreserved PBMC from D7 after CAR-T infusion were thawed and 
resuspended in flow cytometry staining buffer (FACS) (PBS with 2% FBS); 5 μl 
of Fc block (BD Bioscience) was added for 5 min followed by addition of the 
antibodies in BD brilliant stain buffer (BD Bioscience). The cells were stained 
for 20 min at 4 °C using the following antibody clones: CD45 (BV786 BD HI30 
563716)) used at dilution of 1 in 167, CD3 (APC BD Biosciences catalog no. 5H9 
340661) used at dilution of 1 in 83.5, CD4 (V450 BD Bioscience catalog no. SK3 
651850) used at dilution of 1 in 83.5, CD8 (V500c BD Bioscience catalog no. SK1 
647458) used at dilution of 1 in 83.5, CD14 (FITC BD Bioscience catalog no. 
MφP9 347493) used at dilution of 1 in 83.5 and sCD19-PE (BioLegend custom 
conjugation catalog no. 900002598, lot B324342) used at dilution of 1 in 55.6. Cells 
were then washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer followed by addition 
of 7AAD (BioLegend). Live CAR-T cells and non-CAR-T cells were acquired 
separately using a BD FACSAria utilizing the gating strategy in Extended Data 
Fig. 1a with gating based on healthy non-CAR-transduced donor PBMC prepared 
separately for each batch. Samples were resuspended in 0.04% ultrapure bovine 
serum albumin in PBS at 1,000 cells μl–1 density before loading on a 10x Genomics 
Chromium platform. Infusion product and baseline samples were thawed similarly 
and combined into batches of up to four samples per 10x channel loaded at a 
density of 3,000 cells μl–1. For some infusion product samples with a poor postthaw 
viability (<80%), the Miltenyi Dead Cell Removal kit (130-090-101) was used to 
deplete dead cells before scRNA-seq.
Single-cell transcriptome sequencing data generation. Viable cells were 
resuspended in PBS with 0.04% BSA at a cell concentration of 1,000 cells μl−1. A 
total of 40,000 cells were loaded onto a 10x Genomics Chromium instrument 
(10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The scRNA-seq 
libraries were processed using Chromium single-cell 5′ library and gel bead kit v.2 
and coupled scTCR-seq libraries were obtained using Chromium single-cell V(D)
J enrichment kit (human T cell) (10x Genomics). Quality control for amplified 
cDNA libraries and final sequencing libraries was performed using Bioanalyzer 
High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent). Both scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq libraries 
were normalized to 4 nM concentration and pooled in a volume ratio of 4:1. The 
pooled libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq S4 platform. The sequencing 
parameters were: Read 1 of 26 bp, Read 2 of 90 bp, index 1 of 10 bp and index 2  
of 10 bp.
Generation of CAR reference. A custom reference was built using GRCh38 and 
the Ensembl 100 annotation, supplemented with sequences for both the axi-cel 
and tisa-cel constructs. To determine the sequence of these constructs, we created 
an initial reference including the sequences of pELPs 19-BBz52 for tisa-cel, and 
msgv-fmc63-28z53 for axi-cel. We then aligned read two of four of our infusion 
product samples (Tisa-R-21, Tisa-N-20, Axi-R-1, Axi-N-14) to this supplemented 
genome using STAR v.2.5.1b. We used the bcftools call tool (v.1.11) to identify 
variants of the true CAR sequence from our initial reference, and the bcftools 
consensus tool to create an updated fasta file with refined CAR sequences. This was 
then added to our GRCh38-based reference and prepared with Cellranger mkref 
(v.6.0.1) giving the reference genome used for preprocessing of the full dataset.
Preprocessing of scRNA-seq GEX data. Raw fastq files for all 10x runs were 
aligned and quantified using Cellranger v.6.0.1 with the ‘expect cells’ parameter set 
to 5 ×103 per pooled sample (for example a run with five multiplexed samples was 
set to 2.5 × 104) and using the custom reference described above. Gene expression 
matrices were further filtered for ambient contamination using cellbender v.0.2.0.
For all cell multiplexed samples, we ran souporcell v.2020.7 to identify 
genotype clusters using the 1000 genomes common (>2% allele frequency) single 
nucleotide polymorphism sites. The genotype of every patient at these sites was 
identified by running bcftools call on the CAR-sorted D7 samples (since these were 
not multiplexed). The identity of genotype clusters was the reidentified by finding 
the patient with the least discordant genotype calls expected to be in the pool. TCR 
sequencing data for all runs was processed using cellranger vdj (v.6.0.1) and the 
GRCh38_vdj_v5.0.0 reference package.
Classification of cell types. An initial clustering of the cells was performed using 
scanpy54 v.1.8.1 and a standard single-cell workflow. Doublets were filtered by 
running scrublet55 v.0.2.1 on each 10x channel individually for PBMC samples. 
Cells were filtered for a minimum of 200 genes and less than 15% mitochondrial 
RNA transcripts. Data was log-normalized for each cell as ln(1 + 104ng/N) where ng 
represents the number of UMIs detected in gene g out of N total UMIs detected in 
the cell. Variable genes were selected using scanpy’s highly_variable_genes process 
with a minimum dispersion of 0.2 and mean expression values between 0.01 and 3. 
We further blacklisted from clustering consideration the axi-cel and tisa-cel genes, 
any TCR or BCR variable genes, as well as sex-biased genes XIST, RPS4Y1 and 
RPS4Y2. We regressed out the effects of total unique molecular identifiers (UMI) 
counts and mitochondrial RNA percentages, and then standardized the expression 
values with a maximum of ten. We performed principal component analysis 
(PCA), then used Harmony v0.0556 to integrate our data batches. Nearest neighbors 
were computed using the top 18 Harmony-adjusted principal components (PCs), 
and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was run to produce 
the global visualizations shown.
Classification of CD4 and CD8 populations. Due to scRNA sparsity, CD4 and 
CD8 T cells cannot be classified directly by gene expression, and clustering at 
reasonable resolutions did not always cleanly separate these populations. To 
overcome this, we computed a nearest-neighbor graph using k = 100. We then 
calculated smoothed expression of CD4 and CD8A by taking the mean across the 
100 nearest neighbors of every cell. We then classified CD4 and CD8 T cells by 
gating on these expression values (Extended Data Fig. 1c).
Quantification of CD45 isoform expression. Because the important splicing 
events to distinguish CD45RA and CD45RO isoforms occur at the 5′ end of 
the gene (exons 4–7), we were able to develop an isoform quantification model 
similar to those commonly employed in bulk RNA-sequencing57. First for every 
read, we calculated a binary matrix of values Cr,i, which are 1 if splicing of read r 
was compatible with each of the six human isoforms i of CD45 (RO, RA, RAB, 
RB, RBC, RABC). We then calculated what the implied fragment length of the 
sequencing molecule (Li
r
) would be for each isoform i as the distance from the start 
of the gene to the 3′ end of the read (counting only exons included in isoform i). 
The likelihood of a given read r being derived from a fragment of length Li
r could 
then be modeled as
Li
r ∼N
(
μ, σ2)
,
where μ and σ2 parameterize the mean and variance of the fragment length 
distribution for the particular sequencing experiment. Conditioning on these 
parameters, the likelihood of a particular transcript t being a certain isoform can be 
calculated by the product rule over all the reads r with that transcript’s UMI (which 
we define the set Rt)
f
({
Li
r, Cr,i
}
r∈Rt
|It = i;μ, σ2
)
=
∏
r∈Rt
N
(
Li

Cr,i.
The prior probability of a transcript being of a given class was then modeled 
with a categorical distribution parametrized by the vector π. 
It ∼Categ(π),
which allows computation of the posterior probability of a transcript being a 
particular isoform

We then applied expectation–maximization by iteratively computing the above 
quantity (E-step), and applying the following update rules

Supervised classification of T cell subsets. To label cells, in a fashion 
consistent with FACS-based literature, we annotated cells based on the 
expression of commonly used marker genes by thresholding knn-smoothed 
(k = 20) log-normalized expression values as designated in Supplementary 
Table 6. Conventional T cells were classified by differentiation state as Naive 
(CCR7+CD45RA+), CM (CCR7+CD45RA–), EM (CCR7–CD45RA–) and TEMRA 
(CCR7–CD45RA+). We further distinguished two additional T cell subsets: Treg cells 
(FOXP3+) and CD4+ CTLs (CD4+NKG7+).
Validation of T cell subtype classification using 10x demonstration dataset. 
BAM files, gene expression and feature barcode matrices for the dataset ‘PBMCs 
of a Healthy Donor—5′ Gene Expression with a Panel of TotalSeq-C Antibodies’ 
were downloaded from the 10x Genomics website. CD45 isoforms were quantified 
from the BAM files using our tool described above. Gene expression and feature 
barcoding data were normalized in units of log transcripts per 10,000. T cells were 
selected as cells with a protein expression of CD3 above 7.5, and then a typical 
scanpy workflow was used to visualize the data by running PCA followed by 
UMAP. Subpopulations were defined by drawing gates to best separate clusters 
of cells with different combinations of CD4/CD8 and CD45RA/CCR7 positivity 
(Extended Data Fig. 4d). In the feature barcoding data, CD8+ cells had a higher 
background signal of CD45RA and thus a higher threshold was needed than for 
CD4+ cells, whereas in the RNA data a single cutoff could be used for both.
Subclustering of CAR-T populations. We performed subclusterings of 
CAR-T cells for all eight combinations of CD4/CD8 subtype, IP/D7 timepoint and 
tisa/axi-cel product. Harmony batch correction was used to adjust four samples 
that had been run without the FACS sorting procedure, using all other samples as 
a reference. Cells were considered CAR-T if at least a single CAR transcript was 
observed, or if they shared a TCR sequence with another CAR+ cell. Cells were 
then processed using the same pipeline outlined above, with the exception that 
we used fewer (15) PCs and regressed out S and G2M scores. For each of the eight 
sets, we performed Leiden clustering58 to define subpopulations and identified top 
marker genes with a t-test.
Testing for compositional changes. We tested for changes in PBMC population 
frequencies between responders and nonresponders by running scCODA22 using 
T cells as a reference. We fit a model using response and product as predictors, 
and reported cases found to be credible with over 90% inclusion probability 
(corresponding to a 10% FDR).
When testing overall changes in CAR-T cell populations (Fig. 4b), as a suitable 
and consistent population to use as a reference is not possible, we used a modified 
approach. We fit a Dirichlet-multinomial model on the cell counts of each patient 
with parameters αR and αNR for responders and nonresponders, respectively. We 
then calculated a log likelihood ratio statistic between the maximum likelihood of 
this model (L1) and that of a null model fixing αR = αNR (L0).
R = −2log (L0/L1)
Finally, we permuted our responder/nonresponder labels 100,000 times, 
computed a null distribution for R then used this to calculate an empirical P value. 
We reported a Benjamini–Hochberg FDR-corrected Q value, correcting across the 
eight categories of CAR-T cells analyzed.
Pseudobulk differential expression analysis. To perform differential expression 
while controlling for the dependence structure on the cell level introduced by 
interindividual differences, we applied a pseudobulk method. For each gene, 
we calculated the total number of UMIs in a given cell population of interest 
by summing across all cells. Cells from different patients, T cell type (Baseline, 
Infusion-non-CAR, Infusion-CAR, D7-non-CAR, D7-CAR) and CD4/CD8 
subtype were given separate pseudobulk samples, yielding an X by Y matrix of 
UMI counts. We then analyzed this using a limma48 workflow using multilevel 
modeling to account for multiple pseudobulk samples coming from the same 
patient. Counts data was voom-transformed, and sample dependency correlations 
were computed using the patient ID as a blocking variable. The voom transform 
was then recomputed using a model with the blocking structure. The limma model 
was then fitted using gender as a covariate, and contrasts of interest were compared 
between populations of interest.
IP cell type identification. To identify common cell populations across different 
types of CAR-T IPs, we reanalyzed just the cells from the IP samples. We used  
the same workflow as above, with the difference that we performed Harmony  
batch correction using the patient ID as a batch variable. This removes the  
(likely biological) differences between the products, but enabled us to identify 
common populations between the two, more importantly isolating Treg cells in 
tisa-cel products.
Independent Treg validation. We downloaded scRNA-seq gene expression matrices 
of previously published axi-cel infusion products10 from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO accession GSE151511). We filtered cells with ≤200 genes and 
≥10% mitochondrial RNA. Data was processed using the pipeline described 
above, using 25 PCs and harmony batch correction on the sample level to allow 
identification of common populations.
CAR-Treg validation. Lentiviral production. Human embryonic kidney cells 
(HEK293T) were purchased from ATCC and expanded in RPMI 1640 media with 
GlutaMAX and HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 72400-120) with 10% 
FBS (R10). Constructs were synthesized and then cloned into a third-generation 
lentiviral backbone (GenScript). Replication deficient lentivirus was produced by 
transfecting plasmids into HEK293T cells. Supernatant was collected at 24 and 48 h 
after transfection. Virus was filtered and then concentrated by ultracentrifugation 
followed by storage at −80 °C.
Bulk T cell isolation and CAR production. Anonymized human healthy donor 
leukapheresis products were purchased from the Massachusetts General Hospital 
(MGH) blood bank using an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. 
CD3+ T cells were isolated using a T cell rosette-sep isolation kit (STEMCELL 
Technologies, catalog no. 15061) and then activated using CD3/CD28 Dynabeads 
at a 3:1 bead:T cell ratio (Life Technologies, catalog no. 40203D) in R10 with 
penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 15140122), and 
20 IU ml–1 recombinant human interleukin (IL)-2 (Peprotech, catalog no. 200-02). 
CARs were transduced with lentivirus at a multiplicity of infection of five on day 1 
and expanded with media doubling and IL-2 replacement every 2–3 days. After 
1 week the CARs underwent magnetic debeading, followed by another week  
of expansion.
Treg isolation and CAR production. CD4+ T cells were isolated from the autologous 
donor leukopak (relative to CD3+ cells) using the Rosette-sep Human CD4+ T cell 
negative selection isolation kit with a Ficoll gradient (STEMCELL Technologies, 
catalog no. 15062). Isolated CD4+ cells were then enriched for CD25 using 
CD25-PE antibody staining (BD Bioscience 2A3) and subsequent anti-PE bead 
selection (Miltenyi Biotec, catalog no.130-048-801). The resultant two populations 
(CD4+CD25high, and CD4+CD25low) were then stained with CD4 (BV510 BD 
Biosciences, catalog no. SK3 562970) used at a dilution of 1 in 20, CD8 (APC-H7 
BD Biosciences, catalog no. SK1 560273) used at a dilution of 1:40, CD127 (BV 
711 BD Biosciences, catalog no. HIL-7R-M21 561028) used at a dilution of 1 in 
20 and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and sorted on a BD FACSAria 
for the following populations DAPI-CD4+CD8–CD25high127– (Treg cells) and 
DAPI-CD4+,CD8–,CD25– (Control CD4s).
Treg cells, CD4-control and bulk-CD3 cells were activated with anti-CD3/
anti-CD28 human Treg expander beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific 1129D) in CTS 
OpTmizer T cell expansion Serum Free Media (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog 
no. A1048501) with 2% human serum (Access Cell Culture LLC), 1× GlutaMAX 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 U ml–1 penicillin-streptomycin and recombinant 
human IL-2 (300 IU ml–1 for Treg cells and 20 IU ml–1 for CD4-control). At 1 day 
after sorting, T cells were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of five with 
lentivirus. After 1 week, the CARs underwent magnetic debeading, followed by 
another week of expansion. Transduction efficiency was assessed on day 12–14 
after transduction, and nontransduced control cells (Treg cells, CD4-control or 
bulk-CD3) were added to normalize transduction efficiency across the conditions.
FOXP3 staining. Before activation, samples were drawn from the CD4+CD25high127– 
(Treg cells), CD4+CD25– (Control CD4s) and CD3+ (Bulk-CD3) groups and stained 
for FOXP3 (APC Invitrogen PCH101 17-4776-42) using the intracellular staining 
kit (eBioscience 00-5523-00) used at dilution 1 in 20.
JeKo-1 lymphoma model. NSG (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) mice were 
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and bred in pathogen-free conditions at 
the MGH Center for Cancer Research and all care and conducted experiments 
were carried out with protocols approved by the MGH Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee. Animals were housed at temperatures of 21.1–24.5 °C, 30–
70% humidity and 12 h:12 h light:dark cycles. On day –7, 6-week-old female NSG 
mice were engrafted intravenously with 106 JeKo-1-click beetle green luciferase 
(CBG) lymphoma cells (ATCC). On day 0, a total of 1 × 106 fresh CAR-T cells 
were injected intravenously at the ratios of bulk-CD3, CD4-control and Treg cells as

Ami HT (Spectral Instruments Imaging). Images were analyzed using Aura v. 4.0.0 
(Spectral Instruments Imaging) software.
At the time of euthanasia, spleens were collected and sectioned. One section 
was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and the remainder was pulverized 
mechanically and filtered. Cells were stained for CD3 and analyzed via flow 
cytometry. All non-FACS sorting flow cytometry was performed on a BDFortessa 
X20 utilizing FACSDiva software v.8.0.1.
Formalin-fixed tissue was transferred to 70% ethanol and underwent human 
CD3 (BD Bioscience UCHT1) staining at the MGH histopathology core. Scale  
bars were added utilizing Fiji ImageJ (continuously updated, open source, 
downloaded 2020).
All flow cytometry was analyzed utilizing Flowjo v.10.8.1. Validation analyses 
for in vitro and in vivo experiments utilized GraphPad Prism v.9.0 software.
The swimmer plot was generated in RStudio (v.2021.09.1) using the package 
swimplot (v.1.2.0).

Extended Data Fig. 4 | Detection of CD45 isoforms and T cell subset classification in 5’ RNA-sequencing data. a, Illustration of signal used by CD45 
isoform detection model. For each read in an illustrative sample, a histogram of the fragment length assuming no splicing (RABC isoform) is shown. The 
distribution of reads beyond exon 3 become shifted if they come from an isoform lacking an upstream exon. b, A histogram of the expected fragment 
length after inference of each read is shown for the same sample in blue. The gaussian distribution modeling fragment lengths inferred by EM is plotted in 
orange. c, U-MAP representation of T cells in 10x healthy PBMC demonstration dataset with both RNA-sequencing and feature-barcoding measurements. 
Dataset is colored by CD45RA and CD45RO expression measured by RNA (top, with k = 20 knn smoothing as applied in the paper) and feature 
barcoding (bottom). d, Kernel density estimate plots sorting plots of cells into different memory subsets. Black lines represent cutoff used for gating. e,

Extended Data Fig. 5 | Classification of T cell subtypes. UMAP representations of all a, CD8 and b, CD4 T cells colored by their subtype assignment. 
Expression of marker genes used for subtype assignment for c, CD8 and d, CD4 cells. For each a knn-smoothed (k = 25) estimate is shown (right) 
alongside the raw measurements (left). e, Estimated fractions of CD45 isoforms that are RO (x-axis) or RA (y-axis) in CAR-T cells from infusion products 
and at day 7. f, Mean expression of genes related to differentiation state averaged across Naive, EM and TEMRA cells for Baseline T cells, day 7 CAR-T 
cells. Naive cells for day 7 CAR+ were omitted as they were not seen in quantities that could be analyzed. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals 
derived from bootstrapping cells for 1000 iterations. Shown are n = 20,361 baseline (12,799 EM, 7,108 TEMRA, and 454 Naive) cells from 20 individuals, 
as well as n = 46,750 day 7 CAR-negative (24,436 EM, 22,064 TEMRA, and 250 Naive), and n = 10,010 day 7 CAR-positive (8,712 EM and 1,298 TEMRA) 
T cells from 29 individuals.

Extended Data Fig. 6 | CAR-T subclusters and clonal dynamics. a, Top differentially expressed genes in each CAR-T subcluster, as determined by a t-test. 
The expression is shown for the top 10 marker genes of each cluster displayed in Fig. 4a. b, Demonstration of unique tisa-cel responder with CD8+ cells 
in cluster EM 2. Shown is a scatterplot of the fraction of CD8+ cells in cluster EM 2 (y-axis) vs the fraction of all CAR-T cells that are CD8+ (x-axis). c, For 
each patient with at least 25T cells in both the IP and at day 7, individual TCR clones are plotted by their frequency in the IP (x-axis) and at day 7 (y-axis). 
Clones are colored by whether they are CD8+ or CD4+, and denoted with an ‘x’ if the two timepoint frequencies are significantly different by a two-tailed 
fisher exact test p < 0.05.
