Fidelity of DNA replication is maintained using polymerase proofreading and the mismatch
repair pathway. Tumors with loss of function of either mechanism have elevated mutation
rates with characteristic mutational signatures. Here we report that tumors with concurrent
loss of both polymerase proofreading and mismatch repair function have mutational patterns
that are not a simple sum of the signatures of the individual alterations, but correspond to
distinct, previously unexplained signatures: COSMIC database signatures 14 and 20. We then
demonstrate that in all ﬁve cases in which the chronological order of events could be
determined, polymerase epsilon proofreading alterations precede the defect in mismatch
repair. Overall, we illustrate that multiple distinct mutational signatures can result from
different combinations of a smaller number of mutational processes (of either damage or
repair), which can inﬂuence the interpretation and discovery of mutational signatures.

ells have evolved multiple mechanisms to ensure that
DNA replication occurs in a timely and accurate manner.
However, DNA replication ﬁdelity is frequently compro-
mised in cancer, leading to accumulation of somatic mutations
throughout the evolution of the tumor. These mutations serve as
a footprint of the tumor’s underlying DNA damage and repair
landscape1,2. Speciﬁc mutational signatures have been identiﬁed
in tumors with mutations in the exonuclease (proofreading)
domain of polymerase epsilon (POLE), as well as tumors with
mutations or epigenetic silencing of genes in the mismatch repair
pathway (MMR)3,4. Until recently, it was thought that simulta-
neous loss of both POLE or polymerase delta (POLD1) proof-
reading and MMR function could not be tolerated by cells due to
excessive accumulation of mutations5–7. However, a recent
analysis of tumors from children with biallelic germline MMR
deﬁciency (bMMRD) revealed a subset of tumors with remark-
ably high mutation burdens (>250 mutations/Mb) that also had a
somatic mutation in POLE or POLD18. In a follow-up study,
concurrent to our own, the mutational spectra observed in a large
number of adult tumors were clustered, revealing that a subset of
endometrial and colorectal cancers have spectra similar to the
pediatric bMMRD POLE-mutated cases9. In addition, a study of
more than 500 endometrial tumors revealed that nearly half (12/
30) of the tumors with a POLE exonuclease domain mutation also
displayed microsatellite instability (MSI)10, the characteristic
patterns of insertions and deletions associated with loss of MMR
function. Here, we investigate the mutational properties of
tumors with POLE/POLD1 proofreading loss and MSI. We
identify mutational signatures associated with concurrent POLE
or POLD1 exonuclease mutations (POLE-exo* or POLD1-exo*)
and MMR loss that are distinct from the signatures associated
with either event in isolation.
Results
Proofreading and MMR deﬁciency in endometrial cancer. To
characterize the relationship among POLE/POLD1 proofreading,
MMR function, and mutational signatures, we ﬁrst sought to
identify tumors with simultaneous loss of both pathways.
Endometrial tumors are known to possess relatively high rates of
both events, so we began our search in The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA)
cohort
of
531
endometrial
(UCEC)
samples3.
Experimental MSI status (MSI-high [MSI-H], MSI-low [MSI-L],
or microsatellite stable (MSS)) was available for 410 tumors11,
and we identiﬁed 15 samples classiﬁed as MSI-H that also har-
bored a somatic point mutation in the POLE exonuclease domain
(codons 268–47112), as well as eight MSI-H samples with no
POLE proofreading mutation but instead possessing a POLD1
exonuclease domain mutation (codons 304–51712, Supplemen-
tary Data 1 and 2). The majority of these 23 tumors displayed
large numbers of microsatellite insertions and deletions (MS
indels) indicative of MMR loss13 as well as a high point mutation
burden consistent with loss of polymerase proofreading (Fig. 1a).
Many of these cases (7/15 POLE-mutated MSI-H tumors and 5/8
POLD1-mutated MSI-H tumors) were found to have epigenetic
silencing of MLH1, the most common mechanism that causes loss
of MMR in tumors, suggesting that the high MS indel rates
observed in these tumors were indeed due to MMR deﬁciency.
The majority (7/8) of POLE and all (3/3) POLD1-mutated tumors
classiﬁed as MSI-H but lacking MLH1 silencing had either a
truncating/frame shift mutation or deletion of one of the four
major MMR pathway genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2),
although due to the high mutation rate of POLE, many tumors
may have such mutations in MMR genes by chance.
Tumors
with
either
of
the
two
most
common
POLE
exonuclease domain mutations (P286R or V411L) were rarely
MSI-H (2/30 cases), whereas the majority of tumors with any
other POLE-exo mutation were MSI-H (13/20) (Fisher’s exact test
p = 1.6 × 10−5; Fig. 1b). Interestingly, POLE-exo* tumors with a
V411L mutation were often classiﬁed as MSI-L (7/12 cases)
despite having MS indel burdens that resembled MSI-H samples
with a wild-type (WT) POLE/POLD1 exonuclease domain. In
contrast, most MSI-L tumors with either a P286R POLE mutation
or with WT exonuclease domain did not have high numbers of
MS indels (Fig. 1b). Therefore, whereas P286R and WT POLE
samples were likely classiﬁed as MSI-L due to chance mutation of
a locus assayed in the Bethesda test, the V411L POLE samples
might actually represent bona ﬁde MMR-deﬁcient (i.e., MSI-H)
cases that were misclassiﬁed as MSI-L by the Bethesda assay,
which was developed and validated in colon tumor cohorts
(in which concurrent POLE/POLD1 proofreading loss and MSI
has not been observed).

We next aimed to determine whether POLE/POLD1- and MSI-
mediated mutagenesis occurred simultaneously in the same
cancer cells, or whether the events were separated spatially (i.e.,
occurring in distinct subclones) or temporally (i.e., defective in
non-overlapping time intervals). First, we noted that POLE/
POLD1 exonuclease domain mutations were frequently clonal
(13/15 POLE and 8/10 POLD1 mutations had an estimated cancer
cell fraction [CCF] > 0.9) and that non-clonal POLE/POLD1
mutations appeared to be non-functional passenger events
(Supplementary Figure 1). This suggests that the POLE/POLD1
proofreading defect was present in all cancer cells, and therefore,
present in the same cells as the MMR deﬁciency.
Mutational signatures of replicative repair deﬁciency. We next
reasoned that if the MMR and polymerase proofreading deﬁ-
ciencies were not present simultaneously, then the joint muta-
tional signature should appear as an additive combination of the
signatures corresponding to the individual defects. Alternatively,
if the processes were active simultaneously—that is, if the cells
had loss of both polymerase proofreading and mismatch repair at
the same time—they could potentially yield a distinct mutational
signature reﬂecting the effect of combined loss. To test this
hypothesis, we applied our SignatureAnalyzer tool14,15 that
discovers mutational signatures by applying a Bayesian variant of
non-negative matrix factorization14,16 to mutation data from a
collection of tumors (Methods section).
SignatureAnalyzer identiﬁed 12 mutational signatures in the
set of 531 endometrial samples (Supplementary Figures 2, 3;
Supplementary Data 1, 3; Methods section). To explore these
12 signatures, we correlated their activities (i.e., the estimated
number of mutations contributed by each signature to the total
mutational burden of the tumor) to the MSI status and
POLE/POLD1 exonuclease domain mutation status of each tumor
in the cohort. Eight of the 12 signatures were associated
with deﬁciencies in MMR and/or POLE/POLD1 proofreading
(4/12 showed no such enrichment; Supplementary Figure 4).
Cases with a POLE exonuclease mutation had enrichment of one
of three signatures (Fig. 2a, b), designated as signatures E1–E3.
Signatures E1 and E2 closely resemble the signature previously
associated with somatic POLE exonuclease mutations (COSMIC

signature 10; Supplementary Figure 5)1, whereas signature E3 was
associated with the POLE V411L hotspot mutation (Fig. 2c).
Similarly, we identiﬁed two signatures, designated as signatures
M1 and M2, characteristic of MSI-H tumors (Fig. 2a, b). These
signatures correspond to COSMIC database signatures 6 and 26,
respectively, and have previously been noted in MSI samples
(Supplementary Figure 5)1.
Signatures of concurrent proofreading and MMR deﬁciency.
We next turned our attention to the 15 samples with paired POLE
exonuclease domain mutation and mismatch repair deﬁciency
(POLE-MSI). Despite the presence of both defects in these sam-
ples, we observed minimal contributions from signatures E1–3
and M1–2 (Fig. 2b, signatures E1–3 contributed <20% mutations
in 12/15 samples, and signatures M1–2 <20% in 12/15 samples).
Instead, two distinct signatures—signatures C1 and C2—were
highly enriched in these POLE-MSI tumors (Fig. 3a, b). Sig-
natures C1 and C2 shared certain features with the individual
MSI (M1–M2) and POLE (E1–E3) signatures but also had distinct
motifs such as a unique G[C>A]T peak (Fig. 3c and Supple-
mentary Figure 6). These unique motif features may represent
mutations that can be repaired by either POLE proofreading or
MMR and thus only accumulate in tumors lacking both repair
functions (Fig. 3d).
Comparing the C1 and C2 signatures to the COSMIC signature
database, we found that, when summed using coefﬁcients ﬁt to
maximize the cosine similarity, signatures C1 and C2 closely
resembled a signature of unknown etiology, COSMIC signature
14 (Fig. 3e), more than expected by chance (Supplementary
Figure 7a, b and Supplementary Data 4). Although the activity of
signatures C1 and C2 were correlated in our analysis (R2 = 0.26),
some tumors exhibited high activity of signature C1 relative to
signature C2 (Supplementary Figure 8), demonstrating that
indeed two distinct signatures are active in these samples.
Finally, in addition to identifying signatures of concurrent
POLE-exo* and MMR deﬁciency, we found an additional
signature (designated as signature D1) that was highly active
(>1000 mutations and >30% of mutation burden) in 4/10 MSI-H
tumors that also had a mutation in the exonuclease domain of
POLD1 (Fig. 4a, b). This signature closely resembled COSMIC
signature 20 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figure 5), which had
been associated with MMR deﬁciency but had not been
previously linked to POLD1 proofreading deﬁciency. In the four
tumors with a POLD1 mutation and high levels of signature D1,
the mutation was located within the exonuclease domain (Fig. 4c,
d), including residues D316 and E318 within the exonuclease
active site. Mutations at the homologous position of D316 in yeast
had been shown to impair exonuclease activity17,18, and a D316N
mutation was identiﬁed in an ultramutated gastic tumor19. An
S478N mutation was also associated with high signature D1
activity, and the same mutation in the germline has been
associated with increased risk of early-onset colorectal cancer20.
In one case with high signature D1 activity, there was no
exonuclease mutation, but the tumor did have an L606M
mutation in the POLD1 polymerase domain (Fig. 4c, d), which
had been shown in vitro to increase polymerase delta error rate21
and had also been observed in hypermutated glioblastomas with
germline biallelic mismatch repair deﬁciency8,9. In the remaining
six POLD1-exo* samples with MSI-H, two also had a POLE-exo
mutation and strong contributions from signatures C1 and C2,
making it difﬁcult to conclude whether the mutations do not
impact POLD1 exonuclease function or are overwhelmed by the

effect of the POLE-exo mutation. However, the remaining 4/
6 samples displayed typical MSI spectra dominated by signatures
M1 and M2, suggesting their respective POLD1 alterations
(R306C, V392M, V477M, and V489A) do not impact exonuclease
function. Notably all eight signatures described above can be
clearly seen in the mutation spectrum of each individual patient
with the corresponding defect (Supplementary Figure 9).
To extend and validate our ﬁndings, we expanded our analysis
beyond endometrial cancer. First, we examined somatic mutation
data from ten POLE/POLD1-mutated glioblastoma tumors8
(seven with POLE-exo* and three with POLD1-exo*) from
patients with bMMRD. We combined these cases with 61 TCGA
endometrial cases that had either a POLE or POLD1 proofreading
mutation, including both MSI and MSS cases, and reanalyzed the

mutational signatures. This analysis rediscovered signatures C1,
C2, and D and found that both signatures C1 and C2 were
exclusive to the seven bMMRD samples with POLE-exo*, and
signature D to the three samples with POLD1-exo* (Supplemen-
tary Figure 10, 11). Next, we expanded our search to tumors from
other TCGA cohorts and identiﬁed signatures C1 and C2 in one
stomach tumor (1/400), one pancreatic tumor (1/166), and a
single low-grade glioma (1/516) (Supplementary Figure 12).
Indeed, all three of these cases had a POLE-exo* mutation and
>10,000 somatic exome mutations. The stomach sample dis-
played MLH1 methylation and was MSI-H. MSI status was not
available for the other two samples; however, both the stomach
and glioma tumors had high levels of MS indels (296 and 98,
respectively), indicative of MMR deﬁciency13 (Supplementary
Data 5). Unfortunately, the number of MS indels could not be
determined for the pancreatic tumor due to low purity. Thus, the
POLE-MSI signature is not exclusive to endometrial tumors,
although the frequency is much reduced in non-endometrial
(<1% of
samples)
compared
to endometrial
cancers
(19/
531 samples, ~3.6%).
Genomic properties and covariates. To further investigate the
mechanistic underpinnings of the putative POLE/POLD1-MSI
signatures, we examined the correlation of DNA replication
timing with mutational densities in tumors enriched with each
signature (Methods section). Although most tumors exhibit
increased mutation frequency in late-replicating regions22,23, the
mutational proﬁles of MMR-deﬁcient tumors do not show such
a correlation2, suggesting that the presence of intact mismatch
repair is responsible for this variability. The relationship between
late replication and increased mutational density has been shown
to be particularly strong in POLE-mutated tumors2. We observed
similar trends here: (i) the genomes of MSS tumors with a POLE
proofreading mutation showed increased mutational burden in
late-replicating regions (~20% increase from mean; Fig. 5a); and
(ii) there was no signiﬁcant correlation with replication timing in
MSI tumors with WT POLE exonuclease domain (p = 0.21 and
0.42 for F-test on slope of C>A and C>T proﬁles; Fig. 5a).
However, genomes from POLE-MSI tumors did show an
enrichment of mutations in later-replicating regions, even in
tumors with negligible contributions from signature E (Supple-
mentary Figure 13), suggesting that MMR alone is not the sole
contributor to replication-associated variation (Fig. 5a). POLD1-
exo* genomes did not show the same enrichment (F-test p = 0.49
and 0.55; Fig. 5a), perhaps indicating that POLE-related errors are
unusually biased toward late-replicating regions.
We next characterized replicative (R-class) strand asymmetries.
It was previously observed that loss of either MMR or POLE
proofreading resulted in replication strand-biased patterns of
mutations19,24, suggesting that asymmetric patterns of mis-
matches introduced during leading- vs. lagging-strand synthesis
are only balanced when both POLE and MMR mechanisms are
functional. These trends were conﬁrmed in this data set, as both
POLE-MSI and POLD1-MSI tumors exhibited strong R-class
strand bias (Fig. 5b). Examining the replication asymmetries in
various contexts, we noted that the asymmetry proﬁles of POLE-
MSI genomes most closely resembled those of POLE-MSS
genomes, consistent with error-prone mutant POLE contributing
the majority of mutations on the leading strand template. On the
other hand, the proﬁles of POLD1-MSI genomes were more
similar to those of MSI tumors (with WT POLD1), perhaps
suggesting the mutations unveiled by faulty MMR in the presence
of

Order of repair-deﬁciency events. We next sought to understand
the order in which loss of MMR function and loss of POLE/
POLD1 proofreading function occurred in tumors. It is possible
that loss of POLE/POLD1 proofreading could result in a mutation
in an MMR gene leading to loss of MMR pathway function, or
conversely, that MSI could result in a POLE/POLD1 exonuclease
domain mutation. The majority of cases of sporadic MSI are due
to MLH1 promoter methylation,3 and if MMR loss precedes a
POLE/POLD1-exo mutation, then we may expect a similar pro-
portion of MLH1 methylation in POLE WT vs. POLE-exo* MSI
samples. However, the percentage of MSI patients with MLH1
silencing falls from greater than 80% in POLE-WT cases to less
than 50% in cases with POLE-exo* (Fig. 6a, Fisher's exact p =
2.8 × 10−3), providing evidence against an exclusively MSI-ﬁrst
model.
We next considered the clonality of the mutations generated in
POLE-MSI samples. While the alterations in the MMR or POLE
genes in these tumors are typically clonal (Supplementary
Figure 1), we reasoned that the earlier of the two events may
contribute clonal mutations from its respective signature (E1–3
from a POLE-exo* event or M1–2 from an MSI event) prior to
the occurrence of the second event (after which mutations from
the signatures of concurrent POLE and MSI loss [C1 and C2] will
accumulate, Fig. 6b). Similar approaches were applied to an
aggregated cohort in order to infer whether signatures were active
early or late in tumor evolution,14,26 and a similar analysis of a
bMMRD POLE-exo* case by a concurrent study found an
enrichment of COSMIC signature 14 in the subclonal mutations
of the tumor9. Therefore, we searched for enrichment of signature
E (POLE-MSS) or M (MSI) among the clonal mutations of 19
cases with substantial contributions (at least 100 mutations and at
least 35% of total) of signatures C1 and C2. Using this approach,
we were able to identify ﬁve (of the 19) samples in which
signatures E1–3 were signiﬁcantly (Methods) overrepresented
among the clonal mutations, consistent with a POLE mutation
preceding the acquisition of MSI (Fig. 6c, Supplementary
Figure 14 and Supplementary Data 7). In these cases, when
mutations were separated into clonal and subclonal populations
(Methods section), the characteristic signature E peaks, T(C>A)T
and T(C>T)G, were overrepresented among the clonal mutations
whereas
subclonal
mutations
more
closely
resembled
the
spectrum of signatures C1–2, suggesting that the POLE mutation
occurred prior to loss of mismatch repair. Surprisingly, we noted
that 3/5 of these cases displayed MLH1 silencing as the likely
mechanism of mismatch repair deﬁciency, suggesting that even
when POLE-exo* precedes acquisition of MSI, loss of MMR
function is not always due to POLE-mediated mutagenesis of an
MMR gene. Rather, dysregulation of methylation pathways or
positive selection of MMR-deﬁcient clones due to the POLE
phenotype (e.g., if leaving POLE-induced mismatches unrepaired
allows faster completion of S phase) may drive MSI acquisition in
these cases.
In the remaining 13/19 cases, we could not identify a clear
enrichment of signature E or M among the clonal mutations. In
cases where the POLE-exo* and MSI events occur in close
succession, very few signature E or M mutations would
accumulate before the second event, and thus identiﬁcation by
this method would be poorly powered. Notably, we were not able
to identify cases with signiﬁcant enrichment of clonal signature M
mutations (which would be expected if MSI arose ﬁrst). However,
the mutation rate of signature C is dramatically higher than that
of
signature
M,
and
their
preferred
contexts
are
largely
overlapping; therefore, our power to detect the presence of clonal
signature M mutations is limited.
Discussion
Cells are exposed to numerous mutagenic processes across their
lifetime. Replication errors are an important source of point
mutations across the genome, and replication ﬁdelity is typically
enforced through dual activity of polymerase proofreading and
the MMR pathway. Loss of either of these functions in isolation is
associated with increased mutation burden, characteristic muta-
tional signatures, and unique clinical properties. Here, we char-
acterize three mutational signatures that operate in the context of
concurrent loss of POLE/POLD1 proofreading and MMR func-
tion. These signatures are closely related to COSMIC signatures
14 and 20, and our data provide a mechanistic basis for the
activity of these signatures across several tumor types. Given the
increasing role of tumor DNA repair deﬁciency as a predictive
clinical biomarker—including the role of MSI and POLE/POLD1
mutations as predictors of response to immune checkpoint
blockade27–29—a deeper understanding of the mutational pro-
cesses in these tumors may ultimately inform clinical decision-
making.
Importantly,
the
POLE-MSI
and
POLD1-MSI
signatures
characterized here do not simply represent the aggregate sum of
the two processes, but rather have unique proﬁles that reﬂect the
biological interaction of POLE/POLD1- and MMR-mediated
DNA repair. Our observations demonstrate that signatures can
exhibit non-additive properties that are not described by the
current paradigm for understanding and modeling mutational
processes, and therefore may serve as the basis for new meth-
odologies to discover, analyze, and interpret mutational sig-
natures in cancer. Such improved modeling of DNA damage and
repair processes will become increasingly important as more
cancer mutation data accumulate.
Methods
Calling of somatic mutations. In order to assemble the mutation calls for our
principal cohort of endometrial samples, alignments (BAM ﬁles) of the 547 TCGA
exomes were downloaded from the Genome Data Commons (GDC). Somatic point
mutations were called using Mutect30 and ﬁltered using D-ToxoG31, and indels
were called using indelocator32 (all available at http://www.broadinstitute.org/
cancer/cga). All calls were ﬁltered using a panel of normals. Indels in microsatellite
loci were called using MSMutect13.
Identiﬁcation of repair defects. To identify patients with POLE-exo* and POLD1-
exo*, we searched for mutations in the associated domain using mutation calls
before panel-of-normal ﬁltering. POLE-exo* and POLD1-exo* patients were
identiﬁed as those with a missense mutation called within the exonuclease domain
of the polymerase (codons 268–471 and 304–517, respectively12). All mutations
falling outside this interval, mutations affecting splice sites, or leading to loss of
function were discounted. Microsatellite instability status, as deﬁned by Bethesda
Protocol classiﬁcation,11 and MLH1 silencing was determined as pre-
viously described33 from DNA methylation array data publicly available from the
GDC.
Estimation of cancer cell fraction. By leveraging copy number and mutation data,
ABSOLUTE34 is able to estimate the purity and ploidy of samples. Based on this
information, it is able to provide the cancer cell fraction (CCF) of each mutation, as
well as a conﬁdence interval for the estimate. Sixteen samples for which these
measurements could not be determined (due to low purity, low mutation counts, or
lack of discrete copy number alterations) were excluded from further analysis,
leaving the 531 endometrial samples that constituted our analysis set.
Signature extraction in TCGA UCEC samples. One of the signiﬁcant challenges
of de novo signature extraction in a cohort with heterogeneous mutation burdens is
the increased weight of hyper- or ultra-mutant samples on the discovered sig-
natures, which is particularly pressing in the UCEC cohort with many ultra- or
hyper-mutant samples. To minimize this effect in our analysis, SignatureAnalyzer
was modiﬁed in two aspects to accommodate the large mutation burden of POLE
and MSI samples. First, we used a penta-nucleotide sequence context for single-
nucleotide variants (SNVs) by considering extra contexts

at the −2 and +2 position around the mutated base, which allows 1536 channels
(six possible substitutions, and 256 possible pentamer contexts centered on a given
base) compared to 96 channels in the conventional trinucleotide sequence context.
The use of an increased number of channels (1536 vs. 96 channels) with additional
information from the pentamer context enables a better separation of mutational
signatures with similar spectra when considered in 96 channels (such as signatures
E1 and E3, which correspond to two different POLE hotspot mutations). Second, to
increase discrimination power for MSI samples, which are enriched in short indels,
we included insertions and deletions as additional features, along with SNVs, in the
signature extraction. According to the size of inserted and deleted bases, we added
eight additional channels: INS1, INS2, INS3, and INS ≥4 for insertions and DEL1,
DEL2, DEL3, and DEL ≥4 for deletions. Here, INS1–3 (DEL1–3) denote insertions
(deletions) with the size of one, two, and three bases, and INS ≥4 (DEL ≥4)
represents insertions (deletions) with more than three bases. In summary, the input
for the signature extraction is a mutation count matrix, where each column,
representing a single patient, comprises (1) 1536 SNV channels corresponding to
six possible substitutions (C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and T>G) and 256 possible
pentamer contexts centered at cytosine or thymine and (2) four insertion and four
deletion channels corresponding to sizes of one, two, three, and more than three
nucleotides.
This matrix was then subjected to the Bayesian non-negative matrix
factorization as previously described 14,15. Out of six independent BayesNMF runs,
four converged to the 12-signature solution, while two converged to the 11-
signature solution. Since the only difference of the 12-signature solution from the
11-signature solution was a split of the APOBEC signature (signature O3) from the
broad-spectrum signature (signature O2), we chose the 12-signature solution in
downstream analysis.
Signature extraction. in the combined cohort of TCGA UCEC + bMMRD samples
Mutation calls for ten bMMRD samples from Shlien et al.8 were downloaded from
the Nature Genetics journal website. Since the downloaded MAF had only non-
synonymous SNVs, we also considered only non-synonymous SNVs in the
59 samples with signatures of POLE, POLE-MSI, and POLD1-MSI in UCEC cohort
(Supplementary Data 6) and combined them with the mutations in the ten
bMMRD samples. We again considered the 5-sequence contexts (1536 channels) as
was done for the TCGA endometrial cohort, yielding a matrix of 1536-by-69
mutation counts. Out of SignatureAnalyzer’s ten independent Bayesian NMF runs,
nine converged to the 8-signature solution and one converged to the 9-signature
solution. We have chosen the 8-signature solution for downstream analyses.
Comparison of signatures. In order to compare signatures, we projected them
into 96-channel space by removing indel contributions and collapsing pentamer
channels with a common trimer motif (e.g., the values of the 16 channels AC[C-
>T]GA, CC[C->T]GA,…TC[C->T]GT are all summed to calculate the corre-
sponding 96-space channel C[C->T]G).
Signatures were then compared by calculating the cosine similarity between the
96-dimensional vectors. When comparing signatures with multiple components,
we solved for coefﬁcients that would maximize the cosine similarity of a linear
combination of the components. For example, to compare signature C (made up of
C1 and C2) to COSMIC signature 14 (S14), we ﬁnd values for α1 and α2 that
maximize the quantity:
α1C1 þ α2C2
ð
Þ  S14
α1C1 þ α2C2
k
k S14
k
k
Estimate of FDR when comparing signatures to COSMIC. In order to estimate
the probability of seeing a cosine similarity of 0.99 or higher to a COSMIC sig-
nature when ﬁtting a linear combination of two signatures, as observed between
signatures C1 and C2 with COSMIC signature 14, we employed two approaches.
First, for each pair of our 12 signatures, we calculate the cosine similarity with the
best COSMIC signature, excluding true-positive matches listed in Supplementary
Data 4. For example, signature O1 is the typical CpG signature and is expected, in
combination with any other signature, to match to COSMIC 1 with high similarity.
Therefore, COSMIC 1 is excluded in comparison with signature O1 paired with
any other signature. The distribution of similarities of all resulting matches is
plotted in Supplementary Figure 7a. Second, to estimate the false positive rate due
to mathematical overﬁtting without the need for identiﬁcation of true-positive
matches, we employed a permutation-based approach. For each signature, we
shufﬂe the contributions of the 96 trinucleotide channels resulting in randomized
signatures with equivalent sparsity to our own. We then calculate the cosine
similarity to the best match in the COSMIC database. This process is repeated for
10,000 iterations to estimate the distribution of similarities of randomized sig-
natures to the best COSMIC database match. This distribution is shown in Sup-
plementary Figure 7b.
Calculation of replication timing proﬁles. For each combination of repair defects
(POLE-MSS, POLE-MSI, etc.), we identiﬁed samples with overall spectra domi-
nated by the corresponding signature based on the following criteria listed in
Supplementary Data 6. The coding genome was split into four bins using repli-
cation timing data from six lymphoblast cell lines22. For each bin, we then counted
the number of substitutions of each type that occurred in a given sample. This was
then compared to the expected mutation count, calculated for a given patient p
and substitution S as:
nexp
p;S ¼
X
c2S
λc;p
Nglobal
c
Nbin
c
where c is a channel of substitution type S (e.g., for substitution C>A, channels AA
[C>A]AA, AA[C>A]AC, …TT[C>A]TT). Nc represents the number of opportu-
nities for a mutation of channel c across the genome (global) or in a given bin (bin),
and λc,p represents the mutation burden of channel c for patient p, approximated
by:
λc;p ¼
X
nsig
i¼1
wc;ihi;p
where w and h are elements of the W and H matrix from the NMF extraction.
Error bars were estimated by sampling patients with replacement
1000 times, and calculating the standard deviation of the above metric across
iterations.
Calculation of replicative strand asymmetries. Patients were selected as in the
replication timing analysis. Then, mutational densities were calculated with respect
to the leading strand template, as in our previous work24, for all 12 possible
stranded base substitutions. Asymmetries were then calculated as the log2 ratio of
complementary substitutions. Error bars were estimated by sampling mutations
with replacement 1000 times and calculating the standard deviation of each
measurement.
Test for POLE and MMR deﬁciency event ordering. To test the ordering of
POLE-exo* and MMR deﬁciency events, we reasoned that after the ﬁrst event,
mutations of the corresponding signature (E or M) would be accumulated before
the second event, after which signature C would accrue. Assuming both events
were clonal, this would lead to an enrichment of signature E/M among the clonal
mutations, and contributions should be diminished in the subclonal subset. On the
other hand, if the events occurred more or less simultaneously, we should see no
such enrichment, leading to the following null (H0) and alternative (Ha) hypoth-
eses:
H0 : λc
E

C ≤λs

where λab represents the expected mutation count of signature b with clonality a.
To calculate our test statistics, probabilities of each mutation having been
generated by a given process were assigned as in ref. 14. Then, probabilities were
summed for signatures of a given set (e.g., P(sigM) = P(sigM1) + P(sigM2)). For
each patient, mutations were subset to clonal (mutations with 95% conﬁdence
cancer cell fraction > 0.75) and subclonal (95% conﬁdence of CCF < 0.75). The
number of clonal (nc) and subclonal (ns) mutations in each subset contributed by
signatures E, M, and C was estimated by summing their respective probability
values.
We then randomly sampled 1,000,000 clonal and subclonal mutation counts,
nc* and ns*, from Poisson distributions parameterized by nc and ns for each
signature. p values were then established by counting the fraction of iterations in
which
nc

for signature E and likewise for signature M. Finally, we applied a
Benjamini–Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing correction across patients and
determined signiﬁcance with a threshold of q < 0.1.
