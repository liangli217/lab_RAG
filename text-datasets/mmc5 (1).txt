SUMMARY
The National Cancer Institute’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) investigates tumors
from a proteogenomic perspective, creating rich multi-omics datasets connecting genomic aberrations to
cancer phenotypes. To facilitate pan-cancer investigations, we have generated harmonized genomic, tran-
scriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data for >1000 tumors in 10 cohorts to create a cohesive and powerful
dataset for scientiﬁc discovery. We outline efforts by the CPTAC pan-cancer working group in data harmo-
nization, data dissemination, and computational resources for aiding biological discoveries. We also discuss
challenges for multi-omics data integration and analysis, speciﬁcally the unique challenges of working with
both nucleotide sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics data.

INTRODUCTION
Comprehensive molecular proﬁling is radically changing cancer
research. Genomic catalogs of tens of thousands of tumors
generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Inter-
national Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) add immense
depth to our understanding of mutations that drive tumorigen-
esis.1 As sequencing on individual tumor cohorts are published,
the next wave of manuscripts from these consortia examines
patterns across cancer types to elucidate the context-depen-
dent nature of mutations and their impacts.2 One limitation of
these sequencing-centric efforts is the paucity of data for pro-
teins and their modiﬁcations. A few select proteins were moni-
tored through antibody-based approaches such as reverse
phase protein arrays (RPPA), but broad and unbiased prote-
omics data were not generated. As proteins represent the pri-
mary molecules responsible for metabolism, signaling, and
structure, comprehensive and quantitative protein measure-
ments are an essential part of phenotypic characterization.
To connect genotype to phenotype, a true proteogenomic
approach is needed.3
Proteogenomics analysis is a powerful method for discovering
the next generation of precision treatments for cancer as it
explicitly links genomic mutations to their impact on cellular
physiology.4–6 Early work by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Anal-
ysis Consortium (CPTAC) demonstrated extensive proteome
coverage with TCGA samples,7 but also identiﬁed that sample
collection protocols for TCGA allowed signiﬁcant ischemia
prior to tissue freezing. Thus the phosphorylation data measured
in these tumors represented a mix of cancer-related and
ischemia-related signaling.8 As aberrant cellular signaling is an
important hallmark of cancer dysfunction and ischemia activates
several of the same pathways (e.g., MAPK signaling and
apoptosis), it is necessary to create proteogenomic data from
freshly acquired tumors with protocols designed to avoid
ischemic artifacts.9,10
The CPTAC dataset currently includes 10 cancer cohorts of
prospectively collected tumors analyzed with genomics, tran-
scriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics (Figure 1).
Molecular classiﬁcations derived from these primary data types
are also available, e.g., HLA typing, immune cell decomposi-
tion, and ancestry prediction. Other protein post-translational
modiﬁcation (PTM) data such as acetylomics and glycoproteo-
mics were generated for select cancer types. Standard clinical/
demographic data and histology images have also been made
available. Distributions of sex, age, tumor grade, tumor stage,
smoking history, and recurrence status are illustrated in
Figure 2. Detailed information of sample provenance is given
in Tables S1 and S2. In the original publications investigating
a single cancer cohort,11–20 data were processed and analyzed
by disease-speciﬁc working groups using customized geno-
mics and proteomics data analysis pipelines. Therefore, to
enable pan-cancer integrative analysis, and for consistency
and reproducibility, we created a compendium of datasets
where all proteogenomic data have been re-processed and
harmonized.
Concurrent with this manuscript detailing the data processing
and dissemination, CPTAC investigators have pursued biologi-
cally motivated pan-cancer analyses to illuminate mechanisms
of cancer development. Pan-cancer investigation of protein
post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs) identiﬁed a subset of tu-
mors with signiﬁcant changes to cellular regulation, including
dysregulated DNA repair, altered metabolic regulation associ-
ated with immune response, and patterns of acetylation that
affect kinase speciﬁcity.21 An integration of somatic driver muta-
tions and proteomics data across tumor types resolves distinct
cancer hallmark patterns.22 Analysis groups continue to conduct
thematic studies using the pan-cancer dataset described here,
according to ﬁve identiﬁed themes: oncogenic drivers and path-
ways; DNA damage response; cell of origin; tumor microenviron-
ment and immunotherapy; and clinical imaging, biomarkers, and
actionable targets.
CPTAC datasets are generated as a resource for cancer
research, and community-driven re-analysis is a positive and
anticipated outcome from the program. Indeed, numerous
groups have already begun re-examining the data.23,24 They
powerfully use proteogenomic data to reveal new molecular
subtypes,25–27 prognostic markers,28–30 novel protein variants
from alternative splicing and RNA editing,31–33 and extensive
post-translational regulation for protein complexes.34,35 To
facilitate an increased data reuse and serve the broad audience
of cancer data stakeholders, we present our computational
methodology for data harmonization and multiple dissemination
mechanisms to share both the raw and processed data.
National Cancer Institute Data Commons
The Genomic Data Commons (GDC, https://portal.gdc.cancer.
gov) and Proteomic Data Commons (PDC, https://pdc.cancer.
gov) are National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cloud resources that coor-
dinate storage and analysis of genomics and proteomics data for
cancer research. The proteogenomic data generated by the
CPTAC program is publicly disseminated through GDC and
PDC, which host raw and processed data according to their in-
house pipelines. As components of NCI Cloud resource, the
GDC and PDC are fully integrated with other NCI Research Data
Commons resources, e.g., the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA,
https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/), facilitating cloud-based
analysisofproteomic,genomic,and imaging data. Drivenprimarily
by the CPTAC projects, PDC organizes the data through a robust
data model to maintain consistency and integrity of both data and
associated metadata, and provides an interface to ﬁlter, query,
search, and visualize proteogenomic data. A direct link to the
harmonized data tables stored at the Proteome Data Commons
is https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/cptac-pancancer.
Finally, in addition to thematic repositories, NCI’s Cancer
Research Data
Commons
contains
a data
type-agnostic
resource, the Cancer Data Service (CDS). CPTAC has placed
the processed and curated data ﬁles into the Cancer Data
Service (CDS; https://dataservice.datacommons.cancer.gov/).
The CPTAC data stored in the CDS includes all the harmonized
proteogenomic data for our pan-cancer analyses, including mu-
tation calls, RNA and protein quantiﬁcation tables, clinical and
demographic data, and derived molecular data such as HLA
typing, immune cell decomposition, and ancestry prediction.
The CPTAC pan-cancer data hosted in CDS is controlled data.
Access to controlled access data on CDS is through the NCI

Data from multiple pipelines
Proteomic and genomic data analysis methods are continually
evolving, and a variety of software tools exist for processing
raw data into variant calls and quantiﬁcations (e.g., RNA or pro-
tein abundance matrices) that can be used for downstream ana-
lyses. As CPTAC consists of multiple groups with expertise in
each data type, we have often analyzed data with multiple pipe-
lines. Applying different tools to the same set of data may lead to
different results and sometimes different conclusions. Therefore,
benchmarking is important for tool assessment and selection.
For somatic mutation calling, results from the ICGC-TCGA
DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge show that different
algorithms have characteristic error proﬁles, and an ensemble of
pipelines always outperforms the best individual pipeline.36
Based on this observation, and leveraging our team members’
experience from the Multi-Center Mutation Calling in Multiple
Cancers (MC3) project,37 somatic mutation calling in our harmo-
nized dataset was based on integrated results from the Broad
Institute and Washington University in St. Louis pipelines, which
each included multiple algorithms. RNA-seq data processing
pipelines are now relatively mature with much overlap between
widely used pipelines (e.g., https://nf-co.re/rnaseq). The major
difference between the three pipelines used in this project is
that the pipeline from Baylor College of Medicine includes circu-
lar RNAs in addition to linear RNAs. Quantiﬁcations for the vast
majority of genes are not affected by circular RNAs and show
very high correlation among the three pipelines. To compare
different pipelines for proteomics data quantiﬁcation, we have
developed OmicsEV,38 which uses more than a dozen evaluation
metrics to comprehensively assess data depth, data normaliza-
tion, batch effect, biological signal, platform reproducibility, and
multi-omics concordance. Among the publicly available tools
used by the CPTAC centers, the FragPipe pipeline usually pro-
vides higher data depth while maintaining similar or better per-
formance for other metrics. Using three deep learning-derived
features as evaluation metrics (predicted phosphosite probabil-
ity, absolute retention time [RT] difference between observed
and predicted RTs, and Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient be-
tween observed and predicted spectra), we further found that
FragPipe achieved higher sensitivity and quality for phospho-
peptide identiﬁcation and phosphosite localization compared
with the other tested pipelines.39 Based on these evaluation re-
sults, we provide one non-redundant, harmonized version with
data across all cancer types and omics data types (see Baylor
College of Medicine [BCM] pipeline for pan-cancer multi-omics
data harmonization in Data S1 for details). However, we would
like to emphasize that benchmarking is usually complicated by
the lack of absolute ground truth, and thus more efforts should
be put toward this important but challenging task. We have,
therefore, also included results from multiple data processing
pipelines in the data compendium. Users are encouraged to
read the method description associated with each pipeline;
explicit details can be found in the Data S1.
Programmatic Data Access
Simplifying data access can signiﬁcantly remove barriers to
community use and improve transparency and reproducibility.
Therefore, CPTAC has created a software package that
streams ﬁnal quantitative data tables directly into a program-
ming environment as dataframe variables (Figure 3). The Py-
thon application programming interface (API),40 which originally
streamed data from the individual cancer type publications, has
been updated to provide access to the harmonized pan-cancer
datasets described previously. Because data are streamed in
native pandas dataframes, they are easily integrated with com-
mon machine learning and visualization packages such as
SciKit-learn, PyTorch, Plotly, Seaborn, etc. Additionally, access
to this API is also straightforward within R using the reticulate
package for Python/R interconversion.
Computational APIs also extend the utility of CPTAC proteo-
genomic data by connecting them to other large public data-
sets.41 We have recently expanded our popular R/Bioconductor
tool, TCGAbiolinks,42 to stream CPTAC pan-cancer data. In
addition to leveraging the numerous software tools available
within Bioconductor, TCGAbiolinks facilitates access to molecu-
lar data from TCGA, GENIE, MET500, GTEx, GEO, and IHEC.
With TCGAbiolinks internal functions to harmonize data from
diverse consortia, end-users can explore and validate hypothe-
ses on a comprehensive library of reference datasets using
sharable and reproducible codes.43 See http://bioconductor.

LinkedOmics and LinkedOmicsKB
LinkedOmics (http://www.linkedomics.org) is a data analysis
portal that allows the characterization of any clinical or molecular
feature
of
interest
(e.g.,
survival,
BRAF_V600E
mutation,
miR200c expression, or CHEK2-S422 phosphorylation) using
cancer multi-omics data from TCGA and CPTAC.48 We now pro-
vide the pan-cancer harmonized datasets described in this pa-
per for all CPTAC cohorts in LinkedOmics. For each CPTAC
study, the database stores data for >500,000 attributes including
clinical attributes, mutations at site and gene levels, copy num-
ber alterations at region and gene levels, methylations at site
and gene levels, mRNA expression, miRNA expression, protein
expression, and PTM at site and protein levels. Using three
analytical modules, including LinkFinder, LinkCompare, and
LinkInterpretor, these data can be mined to reveal the conse-
quences of genetic aberrations, characterize functions of genes
and PTMs, and uncover molecular basis of cancer phenotypes.
The on-the-ﬂy, user-deﬁned data queries in LinkedOmics
provide a high level of ﬂexibility for analyzing CPTAC data, but
performing data analysis on-the-ﬂy is time consuming, and
integrating and co-visualizing results from multiple cancer types
and multiple omics data types remain challenging. To address
these challenges, we further developed LinkedOmicsKB, a
new knowledge portal that makes precomputed results for indi-
vidual genes and phenotypes readily available through a single
query. All results for a query gene or phenotype are presented
on a single page with user-friendly visualization to facilitate
easy comprehension. The knowledge portal is available at

PTMcosmos is an interactive web portal designed to catalog and
visualize PTMs in humans. As a key regulator of protein activity,
PTMs play an essential role in our understanding of cancer and
dysregulated cellular states. The PTM sites detected across all

PTMs that are in close spatial proximity,
we included cancer somatic mutations

ProTrackPath: pan-cancer portal
We have developed a web application for accessing pathway
enrichment scores across the pan-cancer cohorts. While previ-
ous ProTrack applications allow users to visualize normalized
raw data for individual cancers,49–51 the ProTrackPath pan-can-
cer portal presents pathway enrichment scores across cancer
types, calculated with a single sample gene set enrichment anal-
ysis (ssGSEA).52 The user speciﬁes a pathway database such as
Hallmark,53 KEGG,54 or Reactome,55 then selects a set of path-
ways to visualize. An interactive heatmap is then generated,
which users can customize by sorting according to any given
track or toggling categorical variables on and off. Additionally,
the portal includes a sample dashboard view, which allows for
viewing clinical characteristics. This allows users to explore the
distributions of the cancer types along with various demographic
and clinical features as bar graphs. Users can ﬁlter samples by
toggling features in each bar graph’s interactive legend, and
then populate the heatmap with their custom-generated cohort.
The portal is available to the public at http://pancan.cptac-data-

ANALYTICAL CHALLENGES FOR PAN-CANCER
MULTI-OMICS
With the rapid development of molecular measurement technol-
ogies, cancer datasets have become multi-modal. CPTAC has
created rich proteogenomic datasets that measure DNA, RNA,
and protein molecules within tumors and adjacent normal tis-
sues (NATs). This diversity of data catalogs a comprehensive
map of cellular state, providing researchers the opportunity to
understand the subtle regulatory interplay between DNA muta-
tion events that give rise to dysregulated signaling networks
and the ultimate cellular phenotype. This large and comprehen-
sive dataset presents several challenges in data integration and
interpretation. In this section, we outline several important con-
siderations for the re-use and re-analysis of proteogenomic data.
The ﬁrst challenge in a proteogenomic dataset is to ensure that
identiﬁers are harmonized. The following examples demonstrate
the challenge. Many genes have multiple protein isoforms due to
alternative splicing, including a noted change in splicing patterns
in cancers.62–64 Each isoform may have a unique function and
combining all data into a single ‘‘gene level’’ measurement could
obscure these differences. Suppose that mRNA data identiﬁes
two distinct transcripts. The transcriptomics data table, there-
fore, reports two database identiﬁers each with a separate quan-
titative value. If the proteomics data do not identify peptides that
differentiate the two isoforms, which protein identiﬁer should be
used? To which transcript data should the protein abundance be
compared? As orthogonal data types, proteomics and transcrip-
tomics frequently identify different isoforms. This situation

is
equally
complex
when
integrating
PTMs, mutations, or epigenetics. If a
phosphorylation or a coding mutation is
observed, which protein isoform should
it be associated with? Which transcript/
protein should be used in comparison
with methylation data? Mapping PTMs
and coding mutations to different protein
isoforms will make it difﬁcult to study the
impact of somatic mutations on PTMs.
Thus, for a large multi-omics harmoniza-
tion
task
such
as
presented
here,
we
recommend
careful
consideration
and transparency in reporting analytical
methods. As potential solutions to miti-
gate the aforementioned challenges, we
suggest the following: (1) using the same
versions of genome assembly and gene
annotation for the processing of data
from all omics platforms and all cancer
types; (2) reporting gene-level quantiﬁcation when isoform level
analysis is unrealistic; and (3) applying a consistent and trans-
parent rule for representative isoform selection when represen-
tative isoform selection is needed but the data are isoform
agnostic, e.g., phosphosite localization annotation.
A second challenge is embracing the full proteogenomic
landscape as the molecular characterization of cells and tissues
becomes more complete. We emphasize that each data type
provides unique value and helps to clarify complex phenotypes.
For example, the proteome and the transcriptome are distinct,
and each provides a meaningful view of cellular processes.
A rich body of research demonstrates that the mRNA and
protein abundances frequently have a poorer correlation than
expected,65–69 a consequence of both translational and post-
translational regulation.70–73 As cancers are often characterized
by regulatory dysfunction, exploring the source of this dysfunc-
tion can be best understood by combining transcriptomics and
proteomics.74 Similarly, the consequence of somatic mutation
in kinases is best observed by combining genomics and phos-
phoproteomics. Indeed, many biological hypotheses can be
best addressed by a fruitful combination of data types. To under-
stand the consequence of genomic copy number variation,
Gonc¸ alves et al., combined genomics and proteomics and
discovered widespread post-transcriptional attenuation in pro-
tein abundance mitigating the impact of gene ampliﬁcation,
especially to preserve stoichiometry in protein complexes.34
The search for novel amino acid variants75 and cancer neo-anti-
gens76–78 is inherently a proteogenomic investigation, as is the
discovery of tumor-speciﬁc splice isoforms79,80 and fusion pro-
teins.81 Combining all the proteogenomics levels into a single
analysis is challenging, but the non-negative matrix factorization
(NMF) methodology is frequently used for integrative clustering
to highlight the unique contribution of each data type.82

Perspective

Despite the great effort to harmonize the multi-omics datasets
across different cancer studies, we want to emphasize that
‘‘batch’’ effects between different cancer types could still remain
in the pan-cancer datasets due to both technical factors, as
omics experiments of different cancer types were carried out
by different labs and/or using different platforms, and biological
factors, as different organs and cancer types have intrinsically
different biology. Thus, when analyzing the pan-cancer data,
one needs to carefully adjust for these batch effects across
different cancer types. For example, when ﬁtting a regression
model to study the dependence of molecular abundances on
other attributes, one can include cancer-type indicators as cova-
riates to account for cancer-type speciﬁc mean values of mole-
cules. Other analysis techniques, such as meta-analysis frame-
work, could also be used to perform pan-cancer level inferences.
Finally, we focus on a challenge speciﬁc to PTMs. In the
CPTAC data, we report quantitative measurement of phosphor-
ylation and selected datasets also have data for acetylation and
glycosylation. Although missing values are a regular part of all
omics data, they are more pronounced in PTM data. One place
where this is particularly problematic is pan-cancer analysis. If
a PTM site is well quantiﬁed in one cancer type (e.g., EGFR tyro-
sine 1172), it may have many missing values in another, which
would complicate a pan-cancer comparison of protein activa-
tion. One might be tempted to roll together all PTMs in a protein
into a single measurement - e.g., the average phosphorylation
state of EGFR. However, we advise against this, as PTMs at
each site in a protein can be functionally independent and may

tional approaches are being developed to improve PTM peptide
identiﬁcation, which will help alleviate the missing value problem
in PTM proteomics.83
Conclusion
Pan-cancer proteogenomic data analysis requires a consistent
dataset processed with a uniﬁed pipeline across all samples.
Several groups have created proteogenomic datasets on
cancer cohorts, exploring diverse genetic backgrounds for com-
mon cancers,84–87 pediatric tumors,50 or understudied tumor
types.88,89 For pan-cancer analyses it is important that individual
datasets follow similar SOPs and process data in a consistent
manner. Therefore, we have re-processed the data from
CPTAC’s 10 cancer cohorts to create a pan-cancer proteoge-
nomic dataset. We presented the description of methods used
to create this data compendium, methods of data access, as
well as key considerations for pan-cancer multi-omics data anal-
ysis. This resource has been used within CPTAC for biological
discoveries under various themes. We hope this also serves as
a resource for the broader cancer research community to
advance cancer diagnosis and treatment.

https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/cptac-pancancer. Raw genomic and transcriptomic data files can be 
accessed via the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov. 
All processed CPTAC pan-cancer data can be accessed via the Cancer Data Service (CDS). 
The CPTAC pan-cancer data hosted in CDS is controlled data. Access to controlled access 
data on CDS is through the NCI DAC approved, dbGaP compiled whitelists. Users can access 
the data for analysis through the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC), accessible 
with a queryable web portal through the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomic Cloud with dbGaP 
Study Accession, phs001287.v16.p6. Data tables harmonized by the BCM pipeline can be 
accessed at https://kb.linkedomics.org/download.  
Sample Collection 
Prospective biospecimen collection (tumor, germline blood and adjacent normal samples where 
feasible) followed a tumor type specific protocol and standard operating procedures (SOPs), 
where sample collection, qualification and processing were optimized for both genomics and 
proteomics 37–46. CPTAC samples were collected by 30+ tissue source sites from both domestic 
and international locations and processed by a central biospecimen core resource. The samples 
were pathology qualified by a general pathologist and later reconfirmed by a disease-specific 
expert pathologist through histopathology image review and immunohistochemistry assays 
where applicable.  
A data compendium 
The CPTAC dataset includes genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, PTM-proteomics and 
clinical/demographic data. Each data type can be processed several ways to produce different 
outputs. For example, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) can be processed to identify somatic 
mutations, or with different algorithms it could be processed to identify copy number variations. 
Additionally, different pipelines can process data towards a similar goal, e.g., somatic mutations 
can be identified via numerous distinct tools and pipelines.  
In the descriptions below, a set of software analysis pipelines are listed, organized by category 
(e.g., genomics) and then the specific resulting data type (e.g. somatic mutation). We also note 
instances where multiple pipelines have been used to generate the same data type. In these 
situations, we include a description of each pipeline. In the data release, the different versions of 
the data types are often referenced by the institution that produced them, e.g., the BCM 
transcriptomics pipeline versus WashU transcriptomics pipeline. 
 
Clinical and demographic data 
Clinical information was downloaded from CPTAC Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Columns 
with different titles which have the same meaning were unified. For the Breast, Colon and 
Ovarian tumors, consent age was converted from months to years. Numbers of examined para-
aortic and other lymph nodes were combined for UCEC, as well as numbers of pelvic, para-

5 
aortic and other lymph nodes positive for tumor. Follow-up information was processed to extract 
earliest time for recurrence and latest time for survival, as well as measure of success of 
outcome, ecog performance status score, and karnofsky performance status score at date of 
last contact or death.  Two versions of both overall and progression-free survival intervals were 
calculated, one pair employed the date of initial pathological diagnosis as the index date; the 
other pair was calculated from the date of sample collection. Earliest of the events of new tumor 
after initial diagnosis, tumor progression, and tumor recurrence was selected as the recurrence 
event for GBM. Note on the type of the event was added. Data on additional surgery for loco-
regional new tumors and for metastasis were merged. Values for sex, race, ethnicity, vital 
status, tumor focality, type of new tumor, pathological stage, and histologic grade were 
standardized. Major characteristics of the cohort are shown in Figure 2 of the main manuscript. 
Genomics  
Somatic Mutation Calling (pipeline from Washington University in St Louis, WashU) 
Somatic mutations were called by the Somaticwrapper pipeline v1.6 (https://github.com/ding-
lab/somaticwrapper), which includes four different callers, i.e., Strelka v.2.9.2 (ref 18), MUTECT 
v1.1.7 (ref 13), VarScan v.2.3.8 (ref 20), and Pindel v.0.2.5 (ref 14) from WES. We kept the exonic 
SNVs called by any two callers among MUTECT v1.1.7, VarScan v.2.3.8, and Strelka v.2.9.2 
and indels called by any two callers among VarScan v.2.3.8, Strelka v.2.9.2, and Pindel v.0.2.5. 
For the merged SNVs and indels, we applied a 14X and 8X coverage cutoff for tumor and 
normal, separately. We also filtered SNVs and indels by a minimal variant allele frequency 
(VAF) of 0.05 in tumors and a maximal VAF of 0.02 in normal samples. We filtered any SNV, 
which was within 10bp of an indel found in the same tumor sample. Finally, we rescued the rare 
mutations with VAF of [0.015, 0.05) in cancer driver genes based on the gene consensus list 
reported in ref 47. 
DNP Calling (pipeline from Washington University in St Louis, WashU) 
In step 12 of Somaticwrapper pipeline v1.6 (https://github.com/ding-lab/somaticwrapper), it 
combined adjacent SNVs into DNP by using COCOON (https://github.com/ding-
lab/COCOONS): As input, COCOON takes a MAF file from standard variant calling pipeline. 
First, it extracts variants within a 2bp window as DNP candidate sets. Next, suppose the 
corresponding BAM files used for variant calling are available. In that case, it extracts the reads 
(denoted as n_t) spanning all candidate DNP locations in each variant set, and then counts the 
number of reads with all the co-occurring variants (denoted as n_c) to calculate co-occurrence 
rate (r_c=n_c/n_t); If r_c ≥ 0.8, the nearby SNVs will be combined into DNP and it also updates 
annotation for the DNPs from the same codon based on the transcript and coordinates 
information in the MAF file. 
Somatic mutation calling (pipeline from Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard)  
Patient whole exome sequencing (WES) data for matched tumor/normal samples were 
analyzed using the Getz Lab’s production hg38 WES characterization pipeline. The hg38 

6 
characterization pipeline runs on the Terra cloud-based analysis platform (https://terra.bio/). 
This pipeline is the Getz Lab’s standard computational workflow, and the analysis steps are 
organized into five modules: (1) DNA Sequence Data Quality Control (including GATK4’s 
CalculateContamination [version GATK 4.1.4.1] and GATK4 Picard tools [version GATK 
4.0.5.1]). (2) Somatic Copy Number Analysis (GATK4 Best Practices Workflow [version GATK 
4.1.4.1]). (3) Somatic Variant Discovery, which includes the discovery of single-nucleotide 
variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels), using MuTect (ref 13) and Manta+Strelka v2 
(refs 12,18). Next, deTiN v1.8.9 (ref 3) is run to account for and rescue tumor-in-normal 
contamination. The resulting SSNV and indel VCFs are each run through the GATK4 Funcotator 
(version GATK 4.1.4.1). (4) Post-Discovery Filtering, which employs a collection of filters for 
removal of alignment artifacts, germline variants, and common sequencing artifacts that occur in 
normal panels. (5) Merging of adjacent somatic Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) into 
dinucleotide polymorphisms (DNPs), trinucleotide polymorphisms (TNPs), and Oligo-nucleotide 
polymorphism (ONPs). (see CPTAC Pan-Can PTM manuscript by the Getz Lab for further 
details) 
Somatic Mutation Callset Harmonization (pipeline from Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard)   
The per patient variant calls employed by the CPTAC PanCan working group are derived from 
the harmonization of variant calls made independently by the Broad and WashU teams. First, 
we filter calls outside of the inosine chemical erasing (ICE) interval (Genomics Platform at the 
Broad Institute) and apply a “panel-of-normals” built from aggregating CPTAC and TCGA 
cohorts for consistency between the two pipelines. In addition, to account for differences in the 
two mutation callsets we: (i) removed all calls with Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) < 0.05 from 
both pipelines and rescued only high confident calls, and (ii) long ONPs were collapsed to 
shorter ONPs by imposing a more stringent merging cerita that requires a 2bp gap length at 
max. Next, we used Asymtools2 (ref 48) to identify a sequencing artifact affecting CPTAC2 
whole exome sequencing. We then corrected for the sequencing artifact by ranking context-
specific mutations by its allelic fraction. Finally, the functional impact of harmonized calls was 
annotated using GATK Funcotator. 
WGS Copy Number Variant Calling (pipeline from Washington University in St Louis, WashU) 
We used BIC-seq2 (ref 23), a read-depth-based CNV calling algorithm to detect somatic copy 
number variation (CNVs) from the WGS data of tumors. Briefly, BIC-seq2 divides genomic 
regions into disjoint bins and counts uniquely aligned reads in each bin. Then, it combines 
neighboring bins into genomic segments with similar copy numbers iteratively based on 
Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), a statistical criterion measuring both the fitness and 
complexity of a statistical model. We used paired-sample CNV calling that takes a pair of 
samples as input and detects genomic regions with different copy numbers between the two 
samples. We used a bin size of ∼100 bp and a lambda of 3 (a smoothing parameter for CNV 
segmentation). We recommend calling segments as copy gain or loss when their log2 copy 
ratios were larger than 0.2 or smaller than -0.2, respectively (according to the BIC-seq 
publication). 

7 
Genomic data post-processing, GISTIC, and MutSig analysis (pipeline from Broad Institute of MIT 
and Harvard)   
The Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC2.0) algorithm (ref 4) was 
used to identify significantly amplified or deleted focal-level and arm-level events, with Q value 
<0.25 considered significant (default parameters were used). MutSig2CV was run on the union 
MAF to evaluate the significance of mutated genes as well as estimate the mutation densities of 
samples. These results were constrained to genes in the Cancer Gene Census 49, with false 
discovery rates (q values) recalculated. Genes of q value < 0.1 were declared significant. 
Germline SNP and short indel discovery from WGS (pipeline from Broad Institute of MIT and 
Harvard)   
Germline mutations were identified using the GATK4 SNPS + Indels best practice workflow 
(https://github.com/gatk-workflows/gatk4-rnaseq-germline-snps-indels). This workflow consists 
of three sub-workflows: (i) Processing-For-Variant-Discovery, (ii) Haplotypecaller-GVCF 50, and 
(iii) Joint-Discovery. Details regarding the specific Terra workflows used to conduct this analysis 
can be found in the public workspace (https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/help-gatk/Germline-
SNPs-Indels-GATK4-hg38). 
 
Germline SNP and short indel discovery from WES (pipeline from Washington University in St 
Louis, WashU) 
Germline Variant Calling was performed using germlinewrapper pipeline v.1.1 
(https://github.com/ding-lab/germlinewrapper), which implements multiple tools for the detection 
of germline insertion/deletion (INDELs) variants and single nucleotide variants (SNVs): VarScan 
(v.2.3.8 (ref 20), with default parameters, except where: --min-var-freq 0.10 --p-value 0.10, --min-
coverage 3 --strand-filter 1) operating on a mpileup stream produced by samtools (v.1.2 with 
default parameters, except where -q 1 -Q 13); GATK (v.4 (ref 51) using its haplotype caller in 
single-sample mode with duplicate and unmapped reads removed and retaining calls with a 
minimum quality threshold of 10); and Pindel (v. 0.2.5b9 (ref 14), with default parameters except 
-m 6, -w 1). We retained germline SNVs called by either GATK or VarScan calls, while we 
required that indels were called by either pindel or at least two out of the three variant callers. All 
resulting variants were filtered to have allelic depth ≥ 5 for the alternative allele. We also filtered 
all INDELs longer than 100 bp. 
 
Structural Variant Calling (pipeline from Washington University in St Louis, WashU) 
Structural variants (SVs) were called by Manta v1.6.0 (ref 12) from WGS tumor and normal 
paired BAMs. We ran Manta on canonical chromosomes with the default record- and sample-
level filters., retaining variants where sample site depth is less than 3x the median chromosome 
depth near one or both variant breakends, the somatic score is greater than 30, and for small 
variants (<1000 bases) in the normal sample, the fraction of reads with MAPQ0 around either 
breakend does not exceed 0.4. It is optimized for the analysis of somatic variation in 
tumor/normal sample pairs. The paired and split-read evidence were combined during the SV 
discovery and scoring to improve accuracy. We suggested prioritizing the variants by the 
number of spanning read pairs that strongly (Q30) support the variants as described by 37.

DNA Methylation Microarray Processing (pipeline from Washington University in St Louis, 
WashU) 
Raw methylation idat files were downloaded from CPTAC DCC and GDC. Beta values of CpG 
loci were reported after functional normalization, quality check, common SNP filtering, and 
probe annotation using Li Ding Lab’s methylation pipeline v1.1 https://github.com/ding-
lab/cptac_methylation. 
 
Gene Level Methylation Data derivation (pipeline from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) 
Pipeline Advantage/Differentiator: this is one of two pipelines used by CPTAC to generate DNA 
methylation quantitative data tables. The primary difference between this pipeline and the others 
is that this pipeline generates gene-level, instead of probe-level, DNA methylation summaries, 
and it uses the promotor and 5UTR regions, instead of the coding regions, of the genes, which 
is associated with down-regulation (silencing) of the expression of the genes.   
 
Gene-level DNA methylation data were generated using the beta values of all probes harboring 
in the islands of promoter and 5 UTR regions of the genes. Samples with missing rate > 10% 
across all probes were excluded, the mean and median levels were calculated, and the 
analyses were performed on the discovery cohort of 7 cancer types separately. For 5 cancer 
types (ccRCC, LUAD, LSCC, HNSCC and PDA) that have DNA methylation data in both NAT 
and tumor samples, consensus clustering analysis was performed as quality control procedure 
to evaluate the separation of clusters on NAT vs tumor samples. The misclassified samples 
were checked for clustering uncertainty and sample labeling.   
 
Ancestry Prediction (pipeline from Washington University in St Louis, WashU)  
We used a reference panel of genotypes and clustering based on principal components to 
identify likely ancestry. We selected 107,765 coding SNPs with a minor allele frequency > 0.02 
from the 1000 Genomes Project (http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/). 
From this set of loci, we measured the depth and allele counts of each sample using the tool 
bam-readcount (https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount, version 0.8.0). Genotypes were 
then called for each sample based on the following criteria: 0/0 if reference count ≥ 8 and 
alternate count < 4; 0/1 if reference count ≥ 4 and alternate count ≥ 4; 1/1 if reference count < 4 
and alternate count ≥ 8; and ./. (missing) otherwise. After filtering markers with missingness > 
5%, ~70k markers remain depending on cohort size and makeup. We performed principal 
component analysis (PCA) on the 1000 Genomes samples to identify the top 20 principal 
components. We then projected our cohort onto the 20-dimensional space representing the 
1000 Genomes data. We then trained a random forest classifier with the 1000 Genomes dataset 
using these 20 principal components. The 1000 Genomes dataset was split 80/20 for training 
and validation respectively. On the validation dataset, our classifier achieved 99.2-99.6% 
accuracy. We then used the fitted classifier to predict the likely ancestry. Each prediction file 
contains classification probabilities for each sample for five ancestries (EUS - European, EAS - 
East Asian, SAS - South Asian, AFR - African, AMR - American Admixture) Github: 
https://github.com/ding-lab/ancestry 
 
MSI Prediction (pipeline from Washington University in St Louis, WashU) 

9 
MSI scores were calculated by MSIsensor (https://github.com/ding-lab/msisensor) and 
interpreted as the percentage of microsatellite sites (with deep enough sequencing coverage) 
that have a lesion. Samples with an MSIscore > 3.5 are classified as "MSI-High" and the rest 
will be classified as "MSS." An intermediate class with 1.0 <= score <= 3.5 can be defined as 
"MSI-Low." 
 
HLA Typing (pipeline from Washington University in St Louis, WashU) 
The wild-type protein sequences are obtained from Ensembl database. We constructed different 
epitope lengths (8-11-mer) from the translated protein sequence. Each sample’s HLA type 
comes from OptiType prediction. We predicted the binding affinity between epitopes and the 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) using NetMHC4 (ref 24). Epitopes with binding affinity ≤ 
500nM which are also not present in the wild-type transcript are reported as neoantigens. 
 
WGS Germline Variant Calling (pipeline from University of Michigan and Icahn School of 
Medicine at Mount Sinai) 
We performed germline variant calling using DNAScope 25, implementing a pipeline based on 
the GATK best-practices and functional equivalence recommendations. Briefly, we first aligned 
the raw paired-end WGS FASTQ files from 779 CPTAC3 blood derived samples to the latest 
human genome build GRCh38 (GDC GRCh38.d1.vd1 version) using bwa-mem 52, and 
performed duplicate marking conformant to Picard specification (compatible with  53). Next, we 
called variants using the DNAScope Haplotyper with `--emit_mode gvcf` using default settings, 
producing one gVCF file per-sample. Next, we genotyped the samples to a set of high quality 
variants from 2,504 unrelated samples from Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project, which were 
re-sequenced to high-depth by the New York Genome Center 54. We used this reference panel 
for imputation because variant calling was performed directly on GRCh38 assembly with good 
coverage (~30x), using a compatible GATK-based workflow. This process of extracting 
genotypes at specified positions is implemented in lopass-genotype.py in the lopass toolkit 
[https://github.com/mctp/lopass], optimized for the relatively low sequencing depth of these 
samples (15X-30X). Next, we performed genotype imputation and phasing using GLIMPSE 55, 
using default settings. 
 
Population Stratification Using Germline WGS Data 
To identify the ancestry of the CPTAC3 participants, we performed principal component analysis 
(PCA) with the 1000 Genomes reference dataset 54. For this analysis, we removed indels and 
rare variants (defined by <5% of minor allele frequency, MAF). For the remaining variants with a 
call rate of at least 0.99, we performed linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning and PCA with 
smartpca using the EIGENSOFT software 26. Finally, we inferred the ancestry of each CPTAC3 
participant by visualizing the PCA plot and selecting cutoffs on PCs 1 through 10 corresponding 
to the five major populations in the 1000 Genomes data (Ad-Mixed American, African, East 
Asian, European and South Asian).

Transcriptomics  
RNA Quantification (pipeline from Washington University in St Louis, WashU) 
We obtained the gene-level read count, Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million 
mapped reads (FPKM), and FPKM Upper Quartile (FPKM-UQ) values by following the GDC’s 
RNA-Seq pipeline (Expression mRNA Pipeline) 
https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/Bioinformatics_Pipelines/Expression_mRNA_Pipeline/, except 
running the quantification tools in the stranded mode. We used HTSeq v0.11.2 (ref 10) to 
calculate the gene-level stranded read count (parameters: -r pos -f bam -a 10 -s reverse -t exon 
-i gene_id -m intersection-nonempty --nonunique=none) using GENCODE v22 (Ensembl v79) 
annotation downloaded from GDC (gencode.gene.info.v22.tsv). The read count was then 
converted to FPKM and FPKM-UQ using the same formula described in GDC’s Expression 
mRNA Pipeline documentation. 
 
RNA Quantification (pipeline from Broad institute of MIT and Harvard)  
Pipeline Advantage/Differentiator: this pipeline generates multiple levels of expression 
quantification, from read counts to isoform proportions, as well as extensive QC metrics to 
facilitate harmonization across different cohorts (e.g., data generated using polyA selection and 
total RNA protocols from CPTAC 2 and 3, respectively). The pipeline uses methods and 
parameters that were extensively benchmarked for GTEx 56. 
 
We re-processed all cohorts using the GTEx/TOPMed pipeline described at 
https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/blob/master/TOPMed_RNAseq_pipeline.md (ref 
56). All RNA-seq samples were re-aligned to GRCh38 with the GENCODE V34 gene annotation 
using STAR v2.7.5a. Optical and PCR duplicates were identified with Picard 2.18.17 
MarkDuplicates. Quality control and gene-level quantification (in Transcripts per Million [TPM] 
units) were performed with RNA-SeQC 2.3.6 (ref 27), and isoform quantification was done with 
RSEM 57. 
 
RNA quantification and circular RNA prediction (Pipeline from Baylor College of Medicine, BCM) 
Pipeline Advantage/Differentiator: this is one of three pipelines used by CPTAC to generate 
RNA-seq based transcriptomics quantitative data tables. The primary difference between this 
pipeline and the others is the separation of linear RNA and circular RNA from the total RNAseq 
data. 
RNAseq fastq files were downloaded from GDC and analyzed by the BCM total RNAseq data 
analysis pipeline using the Hg38 reference genome and GENCODE V34 basic (CHR) 
annotation. First, CIRI (v2.0.6) was used to call circular RNA with default parameters, and BWA 
(version 0.7.17-r1188) was used as the mapping tool. The cutoff of supporting reads for 
circRNA was set to 10. Then we used a pseudo-linear transcript strategy to quantify gene and 
circular RNA expression. In brief, for each sample, linear transcripts of circular RNAs were 
extracted and 75bp (read length) from the 3’ end was copied to the 5’ end. The modified 
transcripts were called pseudo-linear transcripts. Transcripts of linear genes were also extracted 
and mixed with pseudo-linear transcripts. RSEM (version 1.3.1) with Bowtie2 (version 2.3.3) as 
the mapping tool was used to quantify gene and circular RNA expression based on the mixed 

11 
transcripts. After quantification, the upper quantiles of coding genes were normalized to 1500 for 
cross cancer type normalization. The normalized matrix was log2-transformed and separated 
into gene and circular RNA expression matrices. 
 
miRNA Quantification (pipeline from Washington University in St Louis, WashU) 
miRNA-Seq FASTQ files were downloaded from GDC. We reported the mature miRNA and 
precursor miRNA expression in TPM (Transcripts Per Million) after adapter trimming, quality 
check, alignment, annotation, reads counting using Li Ding Lab’s miRNA pipeline 
https://github.com/ding-lab/CPTAC_miRNA. The mature miRNA expression was calculated 
irrespective of its gene of origin by summing the expression from its precursor miRNAs. 
 
RNA Fusion Detection (pipeline from Washington University in St Louis, WashU) 
We used three callers, STAR-Fusion v1.5.0 (ref 17), INTEGRATE v0.2.6 (ref 11), and EricScript 
v0.5.5 (ref 9), to call consensus fusion/chimeric events in our samples. Calls by each tool using 
tumor and normal RNA-Seq data were then merged into a single file and extensive filtering was 
done. As STAR-Fusion has higher sensitivity, calls made by this tool with higher supporting 
evidence (defined by fusion fragments per million total reads, or FFPM > 0.1) were required, or 
a given fusion must be reported by at least 2 callers. We then removed fusions present in our 
panel of blacklisted or normal fusions, which included uncharacterized genes, immunoglobulin 
genes, mitochondrial genes, and others, as well as fusions from the same gene or paralog 
genes and fusions reported in TCGA normal samples 58, GTEx tissues (reported in STAR-
Fusion output), and non-cancer cell studies 59. Finally, we removed normal fusions from the 
tumor fusions to curate the final set. 
 
Cell Type Enrichment Deconvolution Using Gene Expression (pipeline from Washington 
University in St Louis, WashU) 
The abundance of each cell type was inferred by the xCell web tool 21, which performed the cell 
type enrichment analysis from gene expression data for 64 immune and stromal cell types 
(default xCell signature). xCell is a gene signatures-based method learned from thousands of 
pure cell types from various sources. We used the FPKM-UQ expression matrix as the input of 
xCell. xCell generated an immune score per sample that integrates the enrichment scores B 
cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, DC, eosinophils, macrophages, monocytes, mast cells, 
neutrophils, and NK cells; a micro-environment score which was the sum of the immune score 
and stroma score. Besides, we applied CIBERSORTx 22 to compute immune cell fractions from 
bulk gene expression data. 
 
Proteomics  
Global proteomics and phosphoproteomics (pipeline from the University of Michigan) 
Mass spectrometry data from each individual cohort was downloaded from the DCC website. 
The data sets were annotated following their metadata information. MzML files were searched 
using the MSFragger search engine version 3.4 (ref 28) against a GENCODE34 protein FASTA 
database appended with an equal number of decoy sequences. The enzyme was set to 

12 
stricttrypsin (cutafter is KR, butnotafter was left blank). The post-processing was done using the 
Philosopher toolkit version v4.0.1 (ref 29), and the statistical summarization, and reporting was 
done using TMT-Integrator 30. Below are the individual search settings for both the proteome, 
and phosphoproteome analysis, including the necessary setting to account for individual 
experimental settings. 
General settings for global proteomics. Isotope error was set to (−1/0/1/2/3) for all searches. 
Cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.0215) was specified as fixed modification. Methionine 
oxidation (+15.9949), and protein N-terminal acetylation (+42.01060) were specified as variable 
modifications. The search was restricted to tryptic peptides, allowing up to two missed cleavage 
sites. The minimum number of peaks used was set to 15, and the maximum set to 300. The 
precursor ion tolerance, and the fragment tolerance was set to 20 ppm. Serine TMT labeling 
(+229.1629), and peptide N-terminal TMT labeling (+229.1629) were specified as fixed 
modifications. The clear mz range was set to 113.5 - 117.5. 
 
General settings for the Phosphopeptide-enriched samples. The isotope error was set to 
(0/1/2/3). Cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.0215), Serine TMT labeling (+229.1629), and 
peptide N-terminal TMT labeling (+229.1629) were specified as fixed modification. Methionine 
oxidation (+15.9949), and serine, threonine, tyrosine phosphorylation (+79.9663) were specified 
as variable modifications. The precursor ion tolerance, and the fragment tolerance was set to 20 
ppm. The minimum number of peaks used was set to 15, and the maximum set to 150. 
PTMProphet was executed by setting static to true, the fragment ppm tolerance set to 15, the 
PeptideProphet probability threshold set to 0.5, the onions set to b, and the mod list set with 
STY:79.966331,M:15.9949.  
 
Post-processing. MSFragger output files were processed using PeptideProphet 60 to compute 
the posterior probability of correct identification for each peptide to spectrum match (PSM). In 
the phosphopeptide-enriched dataset, PeptideProphet files were additionally processed using 
PTMProphet 61 to localize the phosphorylation sites. Each data set, from every cohort was then 
filtered by Philosopher using the sequential method by combining all pep.xml files. Peptides 
were assigned either as a unique or razor to a single protein with the most peptide evidence 
using the razor approach. PSMs, peptides, and proteins were filtered to 1% False Discovery 
Rate (using the best peptide approach for proteins) and applied the picked FDR target-decoy 
strategy. For each approved PSM, the corresponding precursor ion MS1 intensity was extracted 
using the Philosopher label-free quantification method, using 10 p.p.m mass tolerance and 
0.4 min retention time window for extracted ion chromatogram peak tracing. The quantification 
of the isobaric tags was done using the Philosopher isobaric quantification method, using a 
purity threshold of 0.5, a minimum PeptideProphet probability of 0.7, and an m/z tolerance of 20. 
The bottom 5% PSMs were removed from the final list. The combined protXML file and the 
individual PSM lists for each data set were further processed using the Philosopher filter 
command as follows. To generate summary reports on different levels (gene, peptide, and 
protein for global and phosphopeptide enriched data; additional modification site report for 
phosphopeptide data), all PSM files were processed together using TMT-Integrator. Each PSM 
that passed the following criteria were kept for creating integrated reports, including (1) having a 
TMT label at peptide N-terminus, (2) having non-zero intensity in the reference channel, (3) 

13 
precursor-ion purity above 50%, (4) summed reported ion intensity (across all channels) not in 
the lower 5% of all PSMs (2.5% for phosphopeptide enriched data), (5) fully tryptic peptides, 
and (6) peptide with phosphorylation (for phosphopeptide enriched data). For a peptide with 
redundant PSMs in the same MS run, only the PSM with the highest summed TMT intensity 
was kept for later analysis. PSMs mapping to common external contaminant proteins were 
excluded, and both unique and razor peptides were used for quantification. Next, the reporter 
ion intensities of each PSM were log2 transformed and normalized by the reference channel 
intensity (i.e., subtracted log2 reference intensity from those log2 report ion intensities), 
therefore the intensities were converted into a log2-based ratio (denoted as ‘ratios’ in the 
following paragraphs). After converting the intensities to ratios, the PSMs were grouped based 
on the predefined level (i.e., gene, protein, peptide, and site-level). The interquartile range (IQR) 
algorithm was then applied to remove the outliers in each PSM group, and the remaining ratios 
were median centered. The ratios were converted back to abundances using the weighted sum 
of the MS1 intensities of the top three most intense peptide ions, with the weighting factor 
(computed for each PSM) taken as the ratio of the reference channel intensity to the summed 
reporter ion intensity (across all channels). In generating the site-level reports (phosphopeptide-
enriched data), sites with PTMProphet computed localization probability equal or greater than 
0.75 were considered as confidently localized. Additional details regarding these steps can be 
found in 37. 
 
Abundance table preprocessing. First, based on the median-aligned intensity tables, we 
identified outlier TMT multi-plex data points using Intra TMT-plex T tests. Specifically, for a 
given protein (or phosphosite), we compared its abundances in samples from one TMT-plex and 
that from the rest of the TMT-plexes in the experiment using t-tests. If the measurements of this 
protein (phosphosite) in one TMT-plex was influenced by artificial/technique factors (e.g. false 
peptide/protein identification in that TMT experiment output), the corresponding p-value of the T 
test would be significant. After Intra TMT-multiplex T tests were performed for all proteins 
(phospshosites) across all TMT-plexes of one cancer type experiment, we then applied double-
log-transformation to the p-values and identified those falling beyond 4-standard-deviation 
below the median of all transformed p-values of the cancer type. The corresponding abundance 
measurements of the outlier protein-TMTplex set were removed (replaced with NA). The 
numbers of outlier data points removed in each tumor data set were summarized in Table 1 - 
ProteinPreprocessing. 
After the outlier removal, for each cancer type, we assessed the batch-effects of TMT-plexes 
through careful investigation of PC plots for the proteomic (phosphoproteomic) abundance 
matrices. For data sets with non-ignorable TMT-plex batch effects (Table 1 - 
ProteinPreprocessing), we then applied Combat 31, to remove the technical variation across 
TMT multi-plexes. For some tumor types, such as CCRCC, the TMT-plex design was not 
balanced in the TMT profiling experiment: i.e. the tumor and normal sample size ratios within 
each TMT-plex varied in the experiment. We then further adjusted tumor/normal tissue types 
when performing Combat correction. Additionally, since complete data matrices are needed as 
input for ComBat, we first performed KNN imputation on the data sets using the ‘impute’ R 

14 
package and then we replaced the missing data point back with “NA” in the batch corrected data 
matrices. 
To formally impute missing values, we applied DreamAI (ref 32; https://github.com/ WangLab-
MSSM/DreamAI) on each of the tumor types separately. Imputation was done for the subset of 
proteins or phosphosites that appeared in at least 50% of samples in each data set.

Glycoproteomics (pipeline from Johns Hopkins University) 
Mass spectrometry data from each individual cohort was downloaded from the DCC website. 
The data sets were annotated following their metadata information. MzML files were searched 
using the GPQuest search engine version 2.1 (refs 62,63) against a reported glycopeptide 
database reported in Glycositeatlas 34 appended with an equal number of decoy sequences and 
an N-linked glycan database, which was collected from the public database of GlycomeDB 
(http://www.glycome-db.org). The post-processing, statistical summarization, and reporting were 
done using MS-PyCloud 64. The consensus spectral library for each glycopeptide was 
constructed by using SpectraST and data visualization was done by OmicsOne 36. Below are 
the individual search settings for glycoproteome analysis, including the necessary setting to 
account for individual experimental settings. 
 
Searching N-linked glycopeptides using GPQuest.  Prior to the database search, ProteoWizard 
3.0 was used to convert the .RAW files to .mzML files with the “centroid all scans” option 
selected. The MS/MS spectra containing the oxonium ions (m/z 204.0966) in the top 10 
abundant peaks after removing TMT reporter ions were considered as the potential 
glycopeptide candidates. Isotope error was set to (−1/0/1/2) for all searches. Cysteine 
carbamidomethylation (+57.0215) was specified as fixed modification. Methionine oxidation 
(+15.9949), and protein N-terminal acetylation (+42.01060) were specified as variable 
modifications. The minimum number of peaks used was set to 15, and the maximum set to 100. 
The precursor ion tolerance was set to 10 ppm and the fragment tolerance was set to 20 ppm. 
Lysine TMT labeling (+229.1629), and peptide N-terminal TMT labeling (+229.1629) were 
specified as fixed modifications. The best hits of all glycopeptide-spectrum matchings (GPSMs) 
were ranked by the Morpheus scores 65 in descending order, in which those with FDR < 1% and 

16 
covering > 10% total intensity of each tandem spectrum were reserved as qualified 
identifications. 
 
Post-processing using MS-PyCloud. Glycopeptide-spectrum matchings (GPSMs) were filtered 
based on a user-defined PSM-level false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff and significant GPSMs 
from all sets of each cohort were grouped to infer the represented proteins parsimoniously using 
a bipartite graph analysis algorithm adopted in many protein inference tools 66,67. The final FDRs 
are then estimated at N-glycopeptide-levels using the reversed decoy search. For isobaric 
labeled data, the TMT reporter ion intensities are extracted from the mzML file for MS2 scans 
corresponding to the identified glycopeptides. For TMT data, the TMT reagent lot correction 
factors were used to adjust the reported TMT intensities for interference between TMT 
channels. Log2 ratios are calculated at GPSM-level relative to the user-specified reference 
channel and are then rolled up by the median value to N-glycopeptide-level (intact glycopeptide 
enriched). Normalized log2 ratio matrices are generated using median normalization (MD norm), 
and median normalization plus median absolute deviation scaling (MD norm + MAD scaling). 
Absolute abundances are generated from the log2 ratio matrices by summing the log2 ratios 
with the median log2 value of the reference channel summed MS2 intensities across all sets for 
each N-glycopeptide using the same approach used in the proteome and phosphoproteome 
processing. Additional details regarding these steps can be found in 33,37,62. 
 
BCM pipeline for pan-cancer multi-omics data harmonization 
Gene annotation database and representative isoform selection 
Using the same versions of genome assembly and gene annotation for the processing of data 
from all omics platforms and all cancer types is critical for streamlined and accurate downstream 
pan-cancer multi-omics data integration. The Homo sapiens (human) genome assembly 
GRCh38 (hg38) and the GENCODE V34 basic (CHR) gene annotation, which were the most 
updated at the time of data freeze, were selected for the CPTAC pan-cancer data analysis. This 
annotation includes 19,984 protein coding genes and 40,685 noncoding genes. 
Some analyses, such as somatic mutation annotation, gene level methylation quantification, 
phosphosite location annotation, and sequence-based multi-omics data visualization and 
integration, further benefit from the selection of a representative transcript/protein isoform for 
each gene locus to ensure standardized reporting and efficient data integration. Swiss-Prot and 
MANE Select are two major efforts that aim to select one high-quality representative transcript 
for each protein-coding gene. Leveraging these two resources, we developed a workflow 
(Supplementary Figure 1) and selected one representative isoform for each protein coding gene 
(Table S3). Moreover, 32 genes are associated with multiple Swiss-Prot proteins, and all non-
representative proteins and their longest transcripts were designated as secondary isoforms for 
these genes. The MANE Plus Clinical isoforms were added as supplements of MANE Selects 
when needed for clinical variant reporting. If MANE Plus Clinical and secondary selects are with 
the same proteins and different transcripts for a gene, the MANE Plus Clinical selected isoform 

17 
will be used as the secondary selected isoform. For noncoding genes, the longest isoforms 
were selected as their representative isoforms. 
 
Supplementary Figure 1. Workflow for the selection of representative isoforms for each 
protein coding gene. 
  
Pan-cancer multi-omics data harmonization workflow 
Standardized data processing was applied to all cancer types using the same versions of 
genome assembly, gene annotation, and representative isoform selection. Somatic mutations 
reported by the combined Broad and WashU pipelines in MAF format were converted to VCF 
format and reannotated using ANNOVAR (v2019Oct24) based on the representative isoforms. 
Segment level copy number variations (CNVs) were called by CopywriteR (v2.20.0) using 
matched tumor and normal WXS data. Gistic2 was used to generate gene and focal level CNV 
results based on GENCODE V34 basic (CHR) annotation. Probes of the methylation EPIC array 
were reannotated using the representative isoforms. Probe level meta values were downloaded 
from GDC. Gene and isoform level meta values were defined as the median of meta values of 
probes located in their 5’ UTR and promoter regions. RNAseq fastq files were downloaded from 
GDC and analyzed by the BCM total RNAseq data analysis pipeline using GENCODE V34 
basic (CHR) annotation. Arriba (v2.0.0) was used to call gene fusion using RNAseq data and 
GENCODE V34 basic (CHR) annotation.  Gene and phosphosite intensities reported by the 
Michigan pipeline from the analysis of global and phosphoproteomics data were normalized 
across cancer types by median centering of the medians of reference intensities of each cancer 
type. Phosphosite reannotation was performed to ensure consistent interpretation of the data 
across TMTs and cancer types. Specifically, phosphosites were mapped to the primary and 
secondary isoforms, and those that could not be mapped exactly to the selected isoforms were 
discarded. For sites with peptides that matched more than one location on a single protein 
sequence, the first matching position was selected. Based on the updated site ID, rows with a 
duplicated ID were discarded after ordering by decreasing number of missing values. The site 
ID consists Ensembl gene ID, Ensembl protein isoform ID, site position based on the protein 
isoform sequence, fifteen-mer (+/- 7 amino acids) based on the protein isoform sequence, and a 
flag for whether the protein is a primary (1) or secondary (2) selected sequence.  

18 
To facilitate human understanding of the Ensembl gene IDs, each ID was assigned a unique 
gene name for display. First, all primary selected isoforms were ordered by presence of a 
SwissProt ID that mapped to the Ensembl protein ID, transcript ID listed in the MANE plus 
Clinical annotation, longer CCDS length, longer transcript length, and finally, alphabetic order of 
the Ensembl gene ID. The first Ensembl gene ID was assigned the gene symbol (e.g., AHRR for 
ENSG00000286169.1) and all following had the Ensembl gene ID appended (e.g., 
AHRR_ENSG00000063438 for ENSG00000063438).
