In recent decades, the incidence of EAC has increased markedly in 
the United States and other Western countries1,2. The increasing 
frequency and poor prognosis of this cancer represent a substantial 
health concern. EAC does not develop from the native esophageal 
epithelium but rather originates from intestinal metaplasia of 
the esophageal epithelium (Barrett’s esophagus) that develops in 
response to chronic gastroesophageal reflux. Although the reason 
for the marked rise in these cancers is unknown, factors influenc­
ing the rising rates include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 
Barrett’s esophagus and obesity3. There is great urgency to elucidate 
the genomic alterations underlying EAC to enhance understanding of 
these tumors, aid in early diagnosis and identify therapeutic targets.
Knowledge of the somatic mutations in EAC has been limited to 
studies in small collections of tumors. These studies have identified 
frequent mutations in TP53 (ref. 4) and CDKN2A5. Beyond these two 
genes, small, focused studies have noted sporadic mutations in APC6, 
BRAF7, CDH1 (ref. 8), CTNNB1 (ref. 6), EGFR9,10, KRAS7, PIK3CA11, 
PTEN12 and SMAD4 (ref. 12). Although comparative whole-exome 
sequencing has been reported for 11 EACs and esophageal squamous 
cell carcinomas, no clear contributors to EAC were identified at the 
gene level13.
Here, we describe the landscape and spectrum of genomic altera­
tions in 149 fresh-frozen, surgically resected cases of EAC, including 
adenocarcinomas arising in the gastric-esophageal junction (GEJ), not 
treated with chemotherapy or radiation before surgery. All cases were 
subjected to whole-exome sequencing, with 16 tumor-normal pairs also 
analyzed by whole-genome sequencing. Examination of the somatic 
alterations in sample pairs identified a high frequency of mutations 
and rearrangements. Additionally, we identify a mutational signature 
defined by A>C transversions at AA dinucleotide sites (with the second 
adenine denoting the site of the mutation). Through systematic analy­
sis of the mutated genes, we identify many genes not previously associ­
ated with this cancer. These include ELMO1 and DOCK2, upstream 
modulators of the RAC1 GTPase, and characterize the presence

The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has risen 600% over the last 30 years. With a 5-year survival rate of ~15%, 
the identification of new therapeutic targets for EAC is greatly important. We analyze the mutation spectra from whole-exome 
sequencing of 149 EAC tumor-normal pairs, 15 of which have also been subjected to whole-genome sequencing. We identify a 
mutational signature defined by a high prevalence of A>C transversions at AA dinucleotides. Statistical analysis of exome data 
identified 26 significantly mutated genes. Of these genes, five (TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, ARID1A and PIK3CA) have previously 
been implicated in EAC. The new significantly mutated genes include chromatin-modifying factors and candidate contributors 
SPG20, TLR4, ELMO1 and DOCK2. Functional analyses of EAC-derived mutations in ELMO1 identifies increased cellular 
invasion. Therefore, we suggest the potential activation of the RAC1 pathway as a contributor to EAC tumorigenesis.

RESULTS
Landscape of EAC mutations and rearrangements
To identify somatic alterations in EAC, we performed whole-exome 
sequencing on tumor-normal pairs from 149 cases and whole-genome 
sequencing on 16 pairs (Supplementary Note). Fifteen of the samples 
from whole-genome sequencing had matched whole-exome 
sequencing data, and 14 samples from whole-genome sequencing 
were evaluated on mRNA expression arrays (Supplementary Fig. 1 
and Supplementary Table 1). One tumor on which whole-genome 
sequencing was performed lacked matched whole-exome sequencing 
data owing to sequencing failure for this sample. Somatic mutations 
were identified using the MuTect and Indelocator tools14–17.
For whole-genome sequencing, tumors were sequenced to an 
average depth of 49× coverage, and matched germline DNA sam­
ples were sequenced to 30× coverage, with paired 101-bp reads on 
Illumina HiSeq instruments (Supplementary Table 2). We identified 
a median of 26,161 mutations across the genome per tumor (range 
of 18,881–66,225), corresponding to a median mutation frequency of 
9.9 mutations/Mb (range of 7.1–25.2 mutations/Mb) relative to a hap­
loid genome. The median mutation frequency was highest in inter­
genic regions (13.9 mutations/Mb), intermediate in intronic regions 
(8.7 mutations/Mb) and lowest in coding exons (6.6 mutations/Mb) 
(Supplementary Table 3). This stepwise decrease in mutation fre­
quency was consistently seen in other cancers16. Compared to other 
cancer types, EAC has a high overall mutation frequency that is 
exceeded only in lung cancer18,19 and melanoma20, diseases that 
emerge from clear mutagens. By contrast, analogous sequencing 
of colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRCs) identified a mutation fre­
quency of 5.6 mutations/Mb21 across the genome. The high mutation 
frequency in EAC suggests that these tumors may be exposed to dam­
aging mutagens, perhaps attributable to the harsh environment cre­
ated by gastric refluxate and inflammation22.
We also analyzed whole-genome sequencing data using the dRanger 
algorithm21 to identify chromosomal rearrangements. A total of 2,952 
candidate rearrangements were identified, with a median of 172 per 
tumor (range of 77–402) (Supplementary Table 4). Consistent with 
array data showing a higher degree of structural alterations in EAC 
compared to CRC23, the number of rearrangements was much greater 
than observed with a comparable analysis of CRC genomes21. No 
correlation was observed between the numbers of mutations and rear­
rangements (R2 = 0.0046). Of the rearrangements identified, 20% were 
interchromosomal translocations. Among the intrachromosomal 
alterations identified, a majority (55%) involved aberrant fusions of 
two sequences located within 1 Mb of each other. To identify potential 
fusion gene products that might contribute to the pathogenesis of 
EAC, we examined data for predicted in-frame gene fusions. Thirty-
eight such events were identified (Supplementary Table 5), but no 
recurrent gene fusions were detected.
High frequency of A>C transversions at AA sites in EAC
Epithelial cancers often have variable mutation spectra pointing to 
particular mutagenic stimuli. Therefore, we analyzed the spectrum of 
mutations in EAC detected by whole-genome sequencing. Earlier exome 
sequencing of EACs noted A>C transversions to be more common 
in EAC compared to squamous esophageal carcinoma13. Evaluating 
the whole-genome sequencing data, we found that A>C base changes 
comprised an average of 34% of the total mutations (Supplementary 
Table 6). To comprehensively characterize the mutation spectra, 
we measured the frequencies of base mutations in different tri­
nucleotide contexts and observed a preponderance of C>T tran­
sitions (39.2 mutations/Mb), as seen in most epithelial cancers. 
We further investigated the high frequency of A>C transversions (or 
equivalent T>G transversions on the complementary strand). These 
events showed preference (20.2 mutations/Mb) for the context of 
AA dinucleotides—that is, adenines flanked by a 5′ adenine and any 
3′ nucleotide (Fig. 1a). In total, 84% of A>C mutations were flanked 
by a 5′ adenine. Expanding on these findings, we found that A>C 
transversions at AA dinucleotides were most pronounced when the 
3′ base was a guanine (49.3 mutations/Mb) and was lower when it 
was an adenine (8.0 mutations/Mb), cytosine (16.8 mutations/Mb) or 
thymidine (6.7 mutations/Mb) (Supplementary Table 7). Validating 
these results, genotyping of randomly selected AA>AC mutations 
from intragenic regions showed a concordance rate of 100% (25/25). 
The high frequency of AA>AC transversions seems to be unique to 
EAC, as equivalent events have not been identified in other cancer 
types15,16,18–20,24,25.
Overall, A>C transversions at AA sites accounted for 29% of the 
total mutations (Fig. 1a). Within individual tumors, these transver­
sions at AA sites accounted for 5–48% of mutations (Supplementary 
Table 7), and the event number was correlated with the overall 
mutation frequency (R2 = 0.92) (Supplementary Fig. 2). When we 
excluded transversions at AA sites, the mutation frequency was 8.5 
mutations/Mb, still higher than in most tumor types. Thus, AA>AC 
mutations do not fully explain the elevated mutation frequency in 
EAC relative to other cancers.
We next characterized the distribution of mutations in different 
genomic regions. Although A>C transversions remained notable at 
AA sites, the percentage of all mutations consisting of these transver­
sions was significantly lower in exons (16%) than across the entire 
genome (AAG, P = 0.001; AAT, P = 0.0006; AAC, P = 0.0007; AAA, 
P = 0.0006; two-tailed Student’s t test) (Fig. 1a). These results were 
consistent across the coding regions of all 16 cases evaluated by whole-
genome sequencing (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). In contrast, the 
attenuation of C>T transitions at CG dinucleotides in coding regions 
(39.2 mutations/Mb versus 25.4 mutations/Mb) was smaller than that 
seen for transversions at AA dinucleotides.
The lower frequency of transversions at AA dinucleotides in coding 
areas relative to intergenic regions suggested that these mutations may 
be less likely to occur in transcribed regions or may be repaired effec­
tively by transcription-coupled repair. To evaluate the potential impact 
of gene expression on mutation rates, we compared sample-specific 
frequencies of mutation at AA dinucleotides within gene boundaries 
at varying levels of gene expression in 14 whole-genome sequenc­
ing samples from which mRNA was available for microarray expres­
sion profiling. Higher expression was associated with lower global 
mutation frequency. Additionally, the impact of gene expression on 
attenuating mutation rates was threefold greater at AA sites than for 
mutations in other nucleotide contexts (Fig. 1b and Supplementary 
Table 10). This finding shows a strong effect of local gene expression 
on the development of transversions at AA sites in EAC.
Given the impact of transcription on these mutations, we analyzed 
transversions at AA sites for strand bias. The mutation rates for trans­
versions at AA dinucleotides in introns and exons were calculated sepa­
rately, according to whether the adenine base was on the transcribed 
or non-transcribed strand. The results indicated that AA>AC muta­
tions were more common when the AA site was located on the non-
transcribed strand (12.4 mutations/Mb versus 11.2 mutations/Mb; 
P = 0.0016, Student’s t test, paired). When evaluating mutations at all base

contexts other than AA dinucleotides, a strand bias was not detected 
(9.5 mutations/Mb versus 9.5 mutations/Mb; P = 0.9086, Student’s t test, 
paired) (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 11). These results suggest that 
transversions at AA sites may be more effectively recognized and repaired 
when the mutated adenine is located on the transcribed strand.
Mutations identified by exome sequencing
We next analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 149 tumor-
germline pairs (Supplementary Table 12). A mean coverage depth 
of 83.3× was achieved in neoplastic DNA, and 85.9× coverage was 
achieved in the non-cancerous tissue. Of the exons, 89% were cov­
ered at 8× or greater depth for normal samples and at 14× or greater 
depth for tumor samples, a threshold at which MuTect is powered 
to detect a mutation with an allele fraction of above or equal to 0.3 
(refs. 14,16,17,26). We evaluated mutation calling by comparing 
candidate coding mutations identified by whole-exome sequenc­
ing to calls from whole-genome sequencing for the same tumor. 
Concordance of 85.1% (2,200/2,585) was observed for all events, and 
90% concordance was seen for mutations present at greater than 0.1 
allele fraction (Supplementary Table 13).
Four tumors had markedly higher coding mutation frequencies than 
other cases (14.6–50.9 mutations/Mb). This pattern resembled that of 
CRC where a subset of tumors were hypermutated, which was largely 
attributable to microsatellite instability (MSI). Similarly, MSI-positive 
tumors have been reported to represent 7% of EACs27. The four cases 
with the highest mutation rates were found to be MSI positive, with 
the tumor with the highest mutation frequency having mutations 
in two mismatch repair genes, MSH6 and MSH3 (Supplementary 
Table 14). By contrast, none of the 24 EAC samples with the next 
highest mutation frequencies (greater than 5 mutations/Mb) 
scored positive for MSI. To avoid a potential confounding effect on 
statistical analysis, we omitted the MSI-positive cases from the final 
analysis, leaving 145 tumors.
A total of 17,383 mutations, consisting of 16,516 nonsilent muta­
tions and 1,954 insertion-deletion and/or null mutations were 
detected in the 145-sample cohort for a median of 104 nonsilent 
coding mutations per tumor (Fig. 2). The overall nonsilent median 
mutation frequency was 3.51 mutations/Mb (range of 0.97–10.8 
mutations/Mb). We investigated whether the fraction of transver­
sions at AA sites was associated with clinical variables, including 
age, disease stage, sex and tumor location. Notably, a trend was seen 
in which EACs developing within the tubular esophagus harbored a 
greater fraction of transversions at AA sites compared to tumors in 
the GEJ (P = 0.076, two-tailed Student’s t test), a noteworthy result 
given the possibility that gastric refluxate in the lower esophagus 
serves as a mutagenic insult (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). No 
other significant associations were identified.
Genes significantly mutated in esophageal adenocarcinoma
We observed mutations in 8,331 genes, of which 3,639 were mutated 
in 2 or more samples (Supplementary Table 15). Of these genes, 
199 were mutated in 5% or more of the tumors, including 33 genes 
mutated in over 10% of cases. To identify genes showing evidence of 
positive selection for mutation, we used the mutation significance 
algorithm MutSig14–16,26. This tool compares the mutation occur­
rence in each gene to that which would be expected by chance given 
a background mutation frequency model that factors in the muta­
tion spectra, presence of silent mutations, mutation frequencies 
and regional mutation frequencies along the genome19. We found 
26 genes to be significantly mutated (false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.1), 
with 2 known tumor suppressors in EAC, TP53 and CDKN2A, being 
the most significant (Fig. 2). With the exception of ARID1A, PIK3CA

for the case of at-risk adenine bases when present on the coding or noncoding strands compared to similar 
analysis for all other base contexts. P values were calculated by Student’s t test. All error bars, s.d.

and SMAD4, no other significantly mutated gene had previously 
been implicated in EAC, although several had been implicated in 
other cancers.
Notably, two significantly mutated genes, ELMO1 and DOCK2, 
encode dimerization partners and intracellular mediators of the 
Rho family GTPase, RAC1 (refs. 28,29). Because aberrant RAC1 
activation has been implicated in malignant transformation in other 
cancer types, mainly by enhancing cellular motility30–34, recurrent 
mutations in these genes may be functionally important. Although 
no RAC1 or RAC2 mutations were identified, ELMO1 or DOCK2 
was mutated in 25 EAC samples (17%), with 2 samples having muta­
tions in both genes and 2 samples having 2 independent mutations 
in DOCK2 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 15). Notably, a single 
amino acid, Lys312 of ELMO1, was affected by mutation in three 
tumors, which suggests a gain-of-function phenotype. DOCK2 
is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates RAC1 
directly through GTP loading28,35. To fully activate RAC1, DOCK2 
and ELMO1 interact to relieve mutual autoinhibition29. In cancer 
models, ELMO1 and other DOCK family members have been asso­
ciated with enhanced migration and invasion36,37. Mutations were 
also present in other RAC1 GEFs (TRIO, TIAM1, VAV2 and ECT2) 
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Furthermore, we previously observed focal 
copy number gain of the 11q13 locus containing the serine-threonine 
kinase PAK1, which encodes a principal downstream effector of RAC1 
that has been shown to be oncogenic in breast cancer23,38. The aber­
rant activation of genes related to RAC1 suggests that the motility 
pathway might be important in EAC.
To examine the relevance of ELMO1 mutations, wild-type and 
mutant ELMO1 constructs were generated and introduced into 
NIH/3T3 cells. On the basis of studies in glioblastoma showing a 
correlative increase in cellular invasion with the overexpression of 
wild-type ELMO1 (ref. 37), we hypothesized that ELMO1 muta­
tions would enhance cell invasion. Compared to green fluorescent 
protein (GFP) control, wild-type ELMO1 increased invasion by 
sevenfold (P = 0.0040, Student’s t test, unpaired) (Fig. 3c). ELMO1 
alterations (p.Phe59Leu, p.Lys312Glu, p.Lys312Thr, p.Lys349Arg 
and p.Thr421Asn) resulted in further significant increases (two- to 
sevenfold) in invasion compared to wild-type ELMO1 (Fig. 3c). These 
results suggest that ELMO1 mutations can increase invasiveness and 
potentially contribute to tumorigenesis in EAC.
Additional significantly mutated genes included members of 
the SWI/SNF family of chromatin-remodeling factors: ARID1A, 
SMARCA4 and ARID2. Together, these genes were mutated in 20% 
of tumors. The enzymatic subunit of the chromatin-remodeling

A rt i c l e s
complex, SMARCA4, has been established as 
a putative tumor suppressor14,39. Likewise, 
ARID1A and ARID2 have been implicated 
as tumor suppressors in cancers including 
gastric cancer40–43. Notably, a candidate protein fusion identified by 
whole-genome sequencing also targeted SMARCA4. The predicted 
fusion between exon 11 of SMARCA4 and exon 14 of DNM2 might 
point to an alteration that results in a loss-of-function phenotype 
(Supplementary Table 5). Mutations were also found in other chromatin-
modifying enzymes, including PBRM1 (ref. 44) and JARID2. Taken 
together, 24% (35/145) of EACs harbored mutations in genes encoding 
chromatin-modifying factors (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5).
Another noteworthy gene was SPG20, which was mutated in 7% 
of EACs, with five of the mutations generated by transversions at AA 
dinucleotides (Supplementary Fig. 6). Spartin, the gene product of 
SPG20, was reportedly mutated in Troyer syndrome45, a genetic dis­
order characterized by progressive muscle stiffness and limb paralysis. 
The functions of Spartin include the endosomal trafficking of growth 
factor receptors, inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein signaling 
and ubiquitin targeting46. More recently, SPG20 hypermethylation 
has been linked to colon cancer progression47.
TLR4 was mutated in 6% of EACs. Germline polymorphisms in 
TLR4 correlate with risk of Helicobacter pylori–mediated gastric carci­
noma48. In a lung cancer model, TLR4 inactivation through mutation 
contributes to greater inflammation and tumorigenesis49. TLR4 acti­
vates the innate immune response to pathogen exposure through hetero­
dimerization with MD-2 (ref. 50). Notably, the mutations in TLR4 affect 
residues between amino acids Asp379 and Phe487, a region critical for 
MD-2 interaction51. One mutation affects Glu439, a site essential for 
the hydrogen bonding of TLR4 with MD-2 (Supplementary Fig. 6). 
These mutations suggest disruption of the TLR4–MD-2 complex as a 
potential driver of tumor progression in EAC.
We also identified other significantly mutated candidate genes, 
including the protein kinase A–anchoring factor AKAP6 (mutated 
in 8% of samples), the E3 ubiquitin ligase 
HECW1 (8%) and AJAP1 (6%), which medi­
ates signaling at adherens junctions and 
increases invasiveness in cancer cell lines52. 
NUAK1 (also known as ARK5) was mutated in 
3% of cases, which is notable given that MYC-
overexpressing hepatocellular carcinoma 
models are dependent on NUAK1 (ref. 53).

The lysine acetyltransferase KAT6A (also known as MYST3), recur­
rently targeted by translocation in leukemia54, was also mutated in 
seven specimens (5%) (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Additional candidate genes
Beyond the genes mutated at a statistically significant frequency, we 
queried the data for mutations of biological relevance given their 
recurrence in other cancers. We identified mutations in EAC that 
had been seen 2 or more times across all cancers in the Catalogue 
of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database55: we found 22 
such genes (Supplementary Table 16). Additionally, ten genes were 
significantly mutated (FDR q < 0.1) in limited analysis of COSMIC 
gene territory, including KRAS, CTNNB1 and ERBB2 (Supplementary 
Table 17). These results indicate that genes not reaching statistical sig­
nificance in the cohort may harbor mutations of biological relevance 
in individual tumors.
Mutations targeting therapeutically relevant genes
We queried the data for mutations in genes encoding the therapeutic 
targets of inhibitors approved for clinical use or in preclinical 
development56. Mutations in actionable genes were discovered in 23% 
of tumors, with PIK3CA being the most frequently mutated (Fig. 4). 
When also evaluating the amplification status of genes, 48% of tumors 
in this cohort had a genomic alteration in a gene with a targeted agent. 
The high frequency of focally amplified therapeutic targets23 exceeded 
that of mutation in these same genes in EAC. Therefore, determin­
ing how to effectively treat tumors with amplified targets, especially 
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), should be considered a priority.
Somatic alterations in signal transduction pathways
To explore the functional impact of the mutations, we performed 
unbiased Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment in the overall 
ranked MutSig list using the 8,356 genes with at least 1 nonsilent 
mutation57,58. GO processes related to cell adhesion and chemotaxis 
ranked as enriched near the top of the list (Supplementary Table 18). 
These findings support the hypothesis that enhanced cellular motility 
and invasiveness has an important role in EAC disease progression.
We also studied how cancer-associated pathways were disrupted 
by mutation in EAC. Cell cycle control was altered by point mutation 
in 14% of EACs, with most of the mutations occurring in CDKN2A

A rt i c l e s
(Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4). This process was also frequently 
affected by amplifications at the CCND1, CCNE1 and CDK6 loci23. 
Although activation of β-catenin signaling is ubiquitous in CRC, 
mutations in this pathway were found in only 9% of EACs, with two 
tumors having APC mutations that coincided with mutation in either 
CDH1 or AXIN1 (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Moreover, a 
potential AXIN1 fusion was identified by whole-genome sequenc­
ing in sample ESO-1060 spanning exon 5 of AXIN1 and exon 2 of 
GALNT7, which might alter normal gene function (Supplementary 
Table 5). As in other cancer types, the TGF-β–SMAD signaling path­
way was mutated in 18% of EAC tumors. The most recurrently altered 
gene in this pathway was SMAD4, which was mutated in ten sam­
ples and was also subject to frequent copy number loss (Fig. 5 and 
Supplementary Fig. 4).
We evaluated the frequency and manner of somatic alterations in 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, two common pathways required for the 
proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Unlike in other epithelial 
tumor types where MAPK pathway mutations are common, no BRAF 
mutations were observed in EAC, and NF1 and KRAS mutations were 
seen in only three (2%) and five (3%) tumors, respectively. Three 
of the five KRAS mutations altered Gly12; however, one EAC har­
bored a KRAS c.351A>C (p.Lys117Asn) event, a mutation caused by 
a transversion at an AA dinucleotide that was previously observed in 
CRC59. The PI3K pathway was the most frequently altered oncogenic 
pathway affected by mutation (13%). PIK3CA was mutated in seven 
tumors, and PIK3R1 and PTEN were mutated in five and four tumors, 
respectively (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 4).
We explored mutations in the ErbB family of RTKs, which are 
important therapeutic targets in many cancer types. Although three 
samples harbored EGFR mutations, these alterations were not previ­
ously annotated in other tumors. Moreover, two of these alterations, 
p.Ser447Tyr and p.Ser1153Ile, were predicted by PolyPhen-2 score60 
to not be deleterious to normal function and were thus of question­
able biological relevance. By contrast, ERBB2 mutations were present 
in five tumors. Three mutations affected the kinase domain, includ­
ing two c.351A>C (p.Asp769Tyr) mutations and one c.2327G>T 
(p.Gly776Val) mutation. These alterations have been observed pre­
viously in other cancers61–63.
DISCUSSION
Here, through mutation analysis, we provide insight into somatically 
altered genes and signaling pathways, as well as confirm a high rate 
of A>C transversions in EAC13. We further establish that the rates of 
these mutations are highest in noncoding regions and, within coding 
areas, are over-represented in less expressed genes. Additionally, we 
demonstrate the context specificity of these mutations, showing that 
A>C transversions are most common when the mutated adenine fol­
lows a 5′ flanking adenine (AA), especially at AAG trinucleotides.
This mutational spectrum seems to be unique to EAC, suggesting 
that these mutations are attributable to gastroesophageal reflux, where 
the gastric and duodenal contents travel into the lower esophagus, cre­
ating an environment of inflammation22. Previous studies have linked 
particular substances such as bile acids, nitrosamines and reactive 
oxygen species to the development of metaplasia and carcinomas64, 
but the precise mutagen(s) remain poorly understood. Experiments 
in Escherichia coli exploring the mutagenic potential of an oxidatively 
damaged DNA precursor, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine triphosphate, 
showed that it preferentially induces A>C transversions65. These data 
suggest that A>C transversions in EAC might arise from the oxidative 
damage induced by GERD; however, experimental evidence is necessary 
to identify a culprit stimulus. The identification of this mutational 
signature enables future studies to define specific carcinogen(s) that 
contribute to EAC that potentially aid in the explanation of the rising 
incidence of this cancer.
Statistical analysis also enabled a comprehensive assessment of 
mutated genes in EAC and identified mutations in cancer-related 
genes such as TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4 and PIK3CA. It was notable 
that most well-annotated cancer genes were not affected by transver­
sions at AA sites. In many cases, it is impossible to generate hotspot 
mutations, such as those affecting KRAS Gly12 or PIK3CA Glu545, 
with a transversion at an AA dinucleotide. Additionally, given the base 
composition of stop codons, it is difficult to generate nonsense events 
from transversions at AA sites and impossible to create a stop mutation 
from an A>C transversion when it occurs in an AAG trinucleotide 
context, the most common context for mutations at AA sites in our 
data set. Of the 2,570 coding mutations caused by these events, none is 
a predicted nonsense mutation. Moreover, the data suggest that trans­
versions at AA sites accumulate in genes with lower expression, thus 
reducing their prevalence in the genes contributing to oncogenesis. 
Despite these caveats, it is likely that the mutations caused by transver­
sions at AA dinucleotides do affect genes relevant for these tumors. 
For example, a known transforming mutation in KRAS (c.351A>C; 
p.Lys117Asn) is created by a transversion at an AA dinucleotide.
Consistent with previous reports39–44, loss-of-function mutations 
in chromatin-remodeling enzymes are common in EAC. Previous 
gene studies have also suggested frequent activation of the MAPK, 
PI3K and β-catenin pathways. The data presented here verify the 
presence of frequent mutations in the PI3K cascade but argue against 
wide-reaching mutations in these pathways, thus drawing contrasts 
between EAC and CRC, where β-catenin activation and missense 
mutations of KRAS and BRAF are highly prevalent66.
For the first time, we detected EAC-relevant mutations in regulators 
of invasion and motility, including significantly recurrent mutations 
in DOCK2 and ELMO1. These mutations may increase tumor fit­
ness through alteration of cytoskeletal structure, increase in invasive 
properties or mitogenesis. We show that ELMO1 mutations augment 
cellular invasiveness, thus suggesting one mechanism by which these 
events contribute to tumorigenesis. Given that EAC is a highly inva­
sive tumor that is prone to early metastasis, alterations in the RAC1 
pathway may contribute to this phenotype.
Although we identified potentially actionable genomic alterations 
in 48% of samples, the trastuzumab antibody to ERBB2 (also known as 
HER2) is the only targeted agent used in the treatment of GEJ adeno­
carcinomas, which include EAC adenocarcinomas, with its use guided 
by the overexpression and genomic amplification of ERBB2 (ref. 67). 
Currently, ERBB2 mutation assessment is not performed for EAC, 
despite ERBB2 being altered by both amplification and mutation in 3% 
of samples. The current data point to a potential use of mutation as an 
additional biomarker to guide the use of ERBB2-targeting agents.
Limited knowledge of the genomic aberrations underlying EAC 
has hindered the development of new therapies. Numerous candi­
dates, not previously implicated in this disease, have emerged from 
the current analysis. Functional study of these genes will be required 
to validate and understand their roles in tumorigenesis and to iden­
tify the etiology of the unique spectrum of observed transversions at 
AA dinucleotides. These data provide an enhanced road map for the 
study of EAC and the much-needed development of new therapies 
for this deadly cancer.

ONLINE METHODS
DNA extraction and sample collection. All samples were obtained under 
institutional review board (IRB) approval and with documented informed 
consent. All samples were fresh-frozen primary resections from individuals 
with EAC not treated with previous chemotherapy or radiation. Slides stained 
with hematoxylin and eosin were examined by a board-certified pathologist 
to select cases with estimated carcinoma content of >70%. DNA was extracted 
using salt precipitation or phenol-chloroform extraction. DNA was quantified 
using PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent (Invitrogen).
Whole-exome sequencing. Whole-exome capture libraries were constructed from 
100 ng of tumor and normal DNA after shearing, end repair, phosphorylation 
and ligation to barcoded sequencing adaptors68. Ligated DNA was size selected 
for lengths between 200 and 350 bp and subjected to exonic hybrid capture using 
SureSelect v2 Exome bait (Agilent Technologies). Samples were multiplexed and 
sequenced on multiple Illumina HiSeq flow cells to average target exome coverage 
of 83.3× in neoplastic DNA and 85.9× in non-cancerous tissue.
Whole-genome sequencing. Samples were chosen for whole-genome sequenc­
ing on the basis of purity and ploidy estimates from ABSOLUTE69. Whole-
genome sequencing library construction was carried out with 500 ng of native 
DNA from primary tumor and germline samples for each individual. DNA was 
sheared to a range of 101–700 bp using the Covaris E210 Instrument and then 
phosphorylated and adenylated according to the Illumina protocol. Adaptor-
ligated purification was performed by preparatory gel electrophoresis (4% 
agarose at 85 V for 3 h), and size was selected by excision of two bands (at 500–
520 bp and 520–540 bp), yielding two libraries per sample with average sizes of 
380 and 400 bp, respectively15,16,21. Qiagen Min-Elute column-based cleanup 
was performed after each step. For a subset of samples, gel electrophoresis 
and extraction were performed using the automated Pippin Prep system (Sage 
Science). Libraries were then sequenced with the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx 
or the Illumina HiSeq sequencer with 101-bp reads, achieving an average of 
~30× coverage depth.
Identification of rearrangements. The dRanger algorithm was used to detect 
genomic rearrangements by identifying instances where the two read pairs 
mapped to distinct regions of the genome or mapped in a manner that sug­
gested another structural event such as an inversion. Candidate somatic rear­
rangements were queried in both the matched normal genome and a panel of 
non-tumor genomes to remove germline events. The final scorings of these 
somatic reads were then calculated by multiplying the number of supporting 
read pairs by the estimated quality of the candidate rearrangement (0 to 1). 
This metric is generated by taking into account the ability to align of the two 
regions joined by the putative rearrangement and the chance of detecting such 
a read pair given the library fragment size distribution. Events with scores of 
≥4 (observed in at least 4 read pairs) were included in this analysis.
Validation of selected mutations by mass spectrometry genotyping. A total 
of 45 intergenic AA>AC mutations were selected for validation in tumor and 
germline sample using mass spectrometry genotyping (Sequenom). Mutations 
were randomly selected across six samples, and sites chosen all had estimated 
mutation allelic fractions exceeding 30%, thus enabling mutation detec­
tion20,26,70. Of those assays performed, 25 yielded interpretable data, with 
others failing owing to lack of PCR amplification or probe hybridization in 
the tumor and/or germline samples.
Sequencing data processing and quality control. The processing and analysis 
of exome and whole-genome sequencing data were performed using Broad 
Institute pipelines15,16,26,70. A BAM file aligned to the hg19 human genome 
build was generated from Illumina sequencing reads for each tumor and nor­
mal sample by the Picard pipeline. The Firehose pipeline was used to manage 
input and output files and submit analyses for execution in GenePattern71.
Quality control modules in Firehose were used to compare the genotypes 
derived from Affymetrix arrays and sequencing data to ensure concordance. 
Genotypes from SNP arrays were also used to monitor for low levels of cross-
contamination between samples from different individuals in sequencing data 
using the ContEst algorithm72. One tumor-normal pair (ESO-774) analyzed 
by whole-genome sequencing was not included in the exome analysis, as the 
exome sequencing from that case failed quality control metrics.
Mutation calling. The MuTect algorithm was used to identify somatic 
mutations in targeted exons and whole-genome data14,16,17,26. MuTect identifies 
candidate somatic mutations by Bayesian statistical analysis of bases and their 
qualities in the tumor and normal BAM files at a given genomic locus. We 
required a minimum of 14 reads covering a site in the tumor and 8 in the normal 
sample to declare that a site was adequately covered for mutation calling. We 
determined the lowest allelic fraction at which somatic mutations could be 
detected on a per-sample basis, using estimates of cross-contamination from 
the ContEst pipeline72. Small somatic insertions and deletions were detected 
using the Indelocator algorithm, after local realignment of tumor and normal 
sequences14. All somatic mutations detected by whole-exome sequencing 
were analyzed for potential false positive calls by performing a comparison 
to mutation calls from a panel of 2,500 germline DNA samples. Mutations 
found in 2% of the germline samples or 2% of sequencing reads were removed 
from analysis. MutSig significant mutations, except for all TP53 mutants, 
were reviewed manually in the respective BAM files using the Integrative 
Genomics Viewer.
Mutation annotation. Somatic point, insertion and deletion mutations were 
annotated using information from publicly available databases, including the 
UCSC Genome Browser’s UCSC Genes track73, miRBase release 15 (ref. 74), 
dbSNP build 132 (ref. 75), UCSC Genome Browser’s ORegAnno track76, 
UniProt release 2011_03 (ref. 77) and COSMIC v51 (ref. 55).
Mutation significance analysis. For the purpose of discovering recurrently 
mutated genes, we used the MutSig algorithm, as described19. In short, this 
method builds a background model of mutational processes, which takes into 
account the genome-wide variability in mutation rates. We achieved this by 
considering different covariates that have been shown to affect mutation rate: 
GC content (measured on 100-kb windows), local relative replication time78,79, 
open versus closed chromatin status as determined by HiC (fine-scale mapping 
of the three-dimensional DNA contacts in the nucleus80), gene expression16 
and, finally, local gene density measured in a 1-Mb window. For each gene, we 
defined a set of nearest neighbors according to these covariates and estimated the 
background mutation rate from noncoding (in flanking sequences and introns) 
and silent mutations of these neighbors. We then assigned a score based on the 
ratio between the nonsilent coding mutation rate of the gene and the noncoding 
and silent mutation rate of the given gene and its neighbors. Furthermore, we 
performed an independent significance analysis that was restricted to events 
that had been previously reported in the COSMIC database.
MSI testing. MSI analysis was performed using ten microsatellite markers 
(D2S123, D5S346, D17S250, BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, D18S55, D18S56, D18S67 
and D18S487) as described previously23.
Copy number calling from whole-exome sequencing. Copy number 
ratios were calculated as the ratio of tumor read depth to the average read 
depth observed in normal samples for that region using the CapSeg DNA 
sequencing–based tool (A.M., S.L.C., B. Hernandez, M. Meyerson, G.G. et al., 
unpublished data).
Processing of Affymetrix expression arrays. Raw data were processed using 
the gene chip robust multiarray averaging81 (RMA) approach to provide nor­
malized expression data for each probe set on the arrays.
Cell lines and culture conditions. NIH/3T3 and 293 cells were obtained from 
the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were maintained in DMEM 
supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in 5% CO2.
ELMO1 site-directed mutagenesis. Full-length ELMO1 cDNA was obtained 
from Open Biosystems–Thermo Scientific and cloned into the EcoRI site of 
pBabe(puro). Mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the 
QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. All mutations were verified by sequencing.

ELMO1 retrovirus production and cell infection. pBabe(puro) vector encod­
ing wild-type ELMO1, ELMO1 mutants or GFP (1 µg) was cotransfected with 
1 µg of pCL-Eco into 293 cells with Fugene HD (Roche) overnight. Growth 
medium was replaced with new full-serum medium after 24 h. After an addi­
tional 24 h, retroviral supernatants were harvested, and fresh medium was 
added. Retroviral supernatants were filtered and incubated with target NIH/3T3 
cells in the presence of 5 µg/ml polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide). This 
procedure was repeated again after 24 h. Stably infected cells were selected for 
under puromycin (1 µg/ml) pressure for 2 weeks. Expression of the ELMO1 
constructs was confirmed by protein blotting with an antibody to ELMO1 
(ab2239, Abcam).
Matrigel invasion assays. Transwell chambers (BD Biosciences) coated with 
Growth Factor–Reduced Matrigel were activated in serum-free medium at 
37 °C for 2 h. NIH/3T3 cells (1 × 104) were plated in Matrigel invasion chambers 
with full-serum medium in the lower chamber only. After 24 h, non-invading 
cells in the top chamber were removed by cotton swab, and invading cells 
were fixed and stained using Diff-Quik staining solutions according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (VWR International). The number of invading 
cells from each of four fields was counted at 20× magnification.
