l Comprehensive
genomic analyses of
PMBL reveal new
genetic drivers such
as ZNF217.
l High mutational
burden, MSI, and
APOBEC signatures
may be additional
mechanisms of
sensitivity to PD-1
blockade in PMBL.
Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas (PMBLs) are aggressive tumors that typically
present as large mediastinal masses in young women. PMBLs share clinical, transcriptional,
and molecular features with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), including constitutive
activation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), JAK/STAT signaling, and programmed cell death
protein 1 (PD-1)–mediated immune evasion. The demonstrated efﬁcacy of PD-1 blockade in
relapsed/refractory PMBLs led to recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration
and underscored the importance of characterizing targetable genetic vulnerabilities in this
disease. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of recurrent genetic alterations
—somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and structural variants—in a cohort
of 37 newly diagnosed PMBLs. We identiﬁed a median of 9 genetic drivers per PMBL,
including known and newly identiﬁed components of the JAK/STAT and NF-kB signaling
pathways and frequent B2M alterations that limit major histocompatibility complex class I
expression, as in cHL. PMBL also exhibited frequent, newly identiﬁed driver mutations in
ZNF217 and an additional epigenetic modiﬁer, EZH2. The majority of these alterations were clonal, which supports
their role as early drivers. In PMBL, we identiﬁed several previously uncharacterized molecular features that may
increase sensitivity to PD-1 blockade, including high tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and an
apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) mutational signature. The shared genetic features
between PMBL and cHL provide a framework for analyzing the mechanism of action of PD-1 blockade in these related
lymphoid malignancies. (Blood. 2019;134(26):2369-2382)
Introduction
Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is a rare
aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that is thought
to arise from thymic medullary B cells.1 Typically, PMBL occurs in
young women who present with large, localized mediastinal
masses.1 After its identiﬁcation in 1986,2-4 PMBL was initially
categorized as a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL). Transcriptional proﬁling of PMBL revealed reduced
expression of B-cell receptor signaling intermediates, including
surface immunoglobulin, and constitutive activation of JAK/
STAT and nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling cascades, mo-
lecular features reminiscent of classical Hodgkin lymphoma
(cHL).5-7 In contrast to cHL, PMBL has not been associated with
previous Epstein-Barr virus infection.8 The shared clinical, patho-
morphologic, and molecular features of PMBL and cHL and the
differences between PMBL and DLBCL led to the recognition of
PMBL as a distinct lymphoma entity.1
Previous genetic analyses of PMBL deﬁned mechanisms of
NF-kB activation, including 2p16.1/REL copy gain5,6,9 and
inactivating mutations of TNFAIP3, which encodes the ubiquitin-
editing enzyme A20.10 Recently, another negative regulator of
the NF-kB pathway, NFKBIE, was found to be inactivated by a 4-
bp deletion in PMBLs.11
Additional genetic alterations that increase JAK/STAT signaling
in PMBL have been described including loss-of-function muta-
tions of the phosphatase and negative regulator PTPN112 and
gain-of-function mutations in STAT613 and IL4R.14 We and others
identiﬁed a recurrently ampliﬁed region on 9p/9p24.1 that in-
cludes JAK2 and increases JAK/STAT signaling in PMBL.15-18
Functional data also suggested a disease-essential role of the
9p24.1/JMJD2C-encoded histone demethylase in heterochro-
matin formation.16

Interestingly, the 9p24.1-ampliﬁed region also includes CD274
(PD-L1)/PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2) which increases the expression of
these programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) ligands and
provides a genetic mechanism of immune escape in PMBL.7,15,18
The coampliﬁcation of programmed death-ligand 1 and 2 (PD-
L1/PD-L2) and JAK2 increases the expression of PD-L1 and PD-
L2 both directly by increasing their copy numbers and indirectly
by increasing the expression of the ligands via JAK/STAT
signaling.15,19 Structural variants (SVs) deregulating PD-L1 and
PD-L2 by translocation, inversion, or deletion of the 39 un-
translated region (39UTR) of PD-L1 have also been reported in
PMBL.20
PMBLs exhibit additional genetic alterations leading to im-
mune escape, including SVs of the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) that are reported
to decrease MHC class II expression.21,22 Copy loss of the
MHC class I and MHC class II regions (hereafter MHCI and
MHCII) were also previously described as hallmark features in
PMBL.3,18,23,24
In newly diagnosed patients with PMBL, induction therapy in-
cludes an anthracycline-based polychemotherapy regimen and
an anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) often followed by consoli-
dation radiotherapy of residual mediastinal masses.25,26 Al-
though this approach results in durable remissions in the majority
of these young patients, comorbidities include the long-term
complications of directed radiotherapy.25 In addition, patients
with relapsed/refractory PMBL have more limited treatment
options. The recently demonstrated efﬁcacy of PD-1 blockade
with pembrolizumab in relapsed/refractory PMBL27 led to rapid
approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and under-
scored the importance of characterizing targetable genetic
vulnerabilities in this disease.
For these reasons, we performed a comprehensive genomic
analysis of a representative cohort of newly diagnosed patients
with PMBL and compared their genetic signatures to those of the
related lymphoid disease, cHL.28 These companion studies
provide new insights into shared and unique pathogenetic
mechanisms, including bases of response and resistance to
PD-1 blockade, in both of these diseases.
Material and methods
Patient characteristics and cell lines
We collected diagnostic biopsy specimens from 37 patients with
PMBL, including 2 previously described cases.29 All samples
were centrally reviewed by an expert hematopathologist (S.J.R.).
The patients characteristics are summarized in supplemental
Figure 1 and supplemental Table 1 (available on the Blood
Web site). In this cohort, 65% of the biopsy specimens were
from frozen tissue and the remainder were from formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn-embedded samples; the majority of patients (95%)
had no patient-matched normal specimens (supplemental
Figure 1; supplemental Table 1). This study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute. Three PMBL cell lines, Farage, Karpas 1106P, and
U2940, were obtained from the German Cell Line Collection
and were conﬁrmed by short tandem repeat proﬁling before
analysis.
DNA extraction, library preparation, and
whole-exome sequencing
DNA extraction, library preparation, and whole-exome se-
quencing (WES) and SV detection for the frozen tumor samples
were performed as recently reported.30 For the cell lines and
formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded samples, DNA was extracted
and libraries were prepared as previously described18 (see
supplemental Methods). All samples with successful library
preparation (yielding $250 ng of DNA libraries) were taken
forward to hybrid capture. Samples were pooled in 3-plex and
captured using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon Exome v5,
the custom DLBCL_Rearrangm_v1 bait set, and the Agilent
SureSelect hybrid capture kit as previously described.18,30
Quality control, ﬁltering, variant calling,
signiﬁcance analyses, mutational signature
analyses, purity/ploidy detection, and
immunohistochemistry
Quality controls included matching of the 2 tumor/normal pairs
by mass spectrometric ﬁngerprint genotyping, estimation of con-
tamination in samples using ContEst31 and alignment and cov-
erage matrices as previously reported (supplemental Table 1).30
Somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs)
and SVs were detected by using previously described analyt-
ical pipelines, including our algorithm for evaluating tumors
without paired normal samples.30 SVs were characterized by
using a pipeline that combines 4 detection algorithms,30 in-
cluding BreaKmer,32 Lumpy v0.2.13,33 dRanger,34 SVaBA,35
and validation by BreakPointer.36 Purity and ploidy were
inferred using ABSOLUTE.37 Genes more frequently mutated
than by chance, candidate cancer genes (CCGs), were identiﬁed
with MutSig2CV38 and recurrent SCNAs were identiﬁed by
GISTIC 2.0.39 Details of the mutational signature analysis are
described in supplemental Methods. Generation of the gene-by-
sample matrix and the mutation density (by tumor type) plot
are described in detail in Wienand et al.28 Presence or absence
of the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like
(APOBEC) signature-associated single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) rs12628403 was detected by MutTect40 in force-calling
mode (–force_alleles –force_output) at hg19 site chr22:39358037.
All other analyses were performed as previously described.30 Im-
munohistochemistry and scoring are described in detail in sup-
plemental Methods.
Results
Signiﬁcantly mutated driver genes
Diagnostic biopsy specimens from 37 patients with PMBL
(median age, 34 years; 70%, female) and 3 additional PMBL cell
lines (supplemental Figure 1; supplemental Table 1) were sub-
jected to WES with an expanded bait set that captured selected
SVs. Because the majority of PMBLs had no patient-matched
normal samples (supplemental Figure 1; supplemental Table 1),
we applied our recently reported analytical framework and al-
gorithms to analyze WES data in the absence of paired normal
specimens.30 After calling single nucleotide variants and indels in
individual patients, we applied our MutSig2CV algorithm38 and
identiﬁed 15 CCGs (q , 0.1; Figure 1A; supplemental Table 2A).
As an orthogonal means of prioritizing mutations, we applied
CLUMPS, an algorithm that overlays all identiﬁed missense mu-
tations onto known 3D structures and detects spatial mutation

clustering.41 CLUMPS detected 10 genes with signiﬁcant 3D
clustering (q , 0.25) including 6 CCGs that were also identiﬁed
by MutSig2CV (supplemental Table 2B). Notably, overlaying
the predicted protein changes onto available 3D protein
structures provided additional insights into the likely functions
of speciﬁc alterations, such as mutational clustering in DNA-
binding domains of STAT6 and zinc ﬁnger protein 217 (ZNF217)
and additional protein interaction domains of ZNF21742
(Figure 1B-C).
The list of CCGs included genes with known roles in PMBL, such
as IL4R14 and TNFAIP310 and mutational drivers in additional
B-cell lymphomas (B2M, GNA13, EZH2, STAT6, IKZF3, XPO1,
TP53, PAX5) and other cancers (TP53 and XPO1)18,30,43-49
(Figure 1A; supplemental Table 2). Pathway enrichment analysis
of the PMBL CCGs with the C2 gene sets of the Molecular
Signature Database (MSigDB)50 highlighted the role of these
alterations in the interferon-g (IFN-g), interleukin-4 (IL-4)/JAK/
STAT, and NF-kB signaling pathways (supplemental Figure 2A).
All of these pathways were previously reported to be perturbed
in PMBL.51
Speciﬁcally, we found mutations in STAT6 (43% of patients), IL4R
(30%), and CSF2RB (14%) to be CCGs within the JAK/STAT
pathway (Figure 1A-C). The mutations in the DNA-binding do-
main of STAT6 included the p.D419 hotspot that was previously
characterized as a gain-of-function alteration in follicular lym-
phoma (Figure 1A-B,D).46 Moreover, we conﬁrmed the recently
described gain-of-function mutations in IL4R, including the
hotspot at I242N, in PMBL.14 The mutations in CSF2RB, which
encodes the common b-subunit of the granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor, IL-3, and IL-5, are of note because
these receptors all signal via the JAK/STAT pathway (Figure 1A-
C).52 We also identiﬁed previously unreported recurrent muta-
tions in IRF2BP2 (19%), which encodes a transcriptional cofactor
that interacts with IRF2 and modulates IFN-g–induced PD-L1
expression in certain tumor models (Figure 1A-C).53,54
In addition to conﬁrming the frequent mutations of the negative
NF-kB regulator TNFAIP3 (41%),10 we identiﬁed recurrent mu-
tations of PAX5 (11%) and IKZF3 (11%), which encode the B-cell
transcription factors PAX5 and Aiolos, respectively (Figure 1A,C).
Recurrent mutations in TP53 were detected at a frequency
(22%) similar to that in DLBCL30 (Figure 1A,C). Interestingly, we
also identiﬁed hotspot E571K mutations in XPO1 (16%), which
encodes an importin-b family member that transports certain
proteins and RNAs to the cytosol, including p53 and STAT6
(Figure 1A,C).55,56 These XPO1 hotspot mutations cluster in the
cargo recognition groove and increase XPO1 activity, as pre-
viously described in PMBL.55-57
PMBLs exhibited several mutations that were previously re-
ported in transcriptionally deﬁned germinal center B-cell
DLBCLs.30,47,58 These included GNA13 mutations in 35% of
PMBLs and hotspot Y641 mutations in EZH2, the catalytic
subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in 14% of
these tumors (Figure 1A,D). We also identiﬁed mutations in
HIST1H1E and HIST1H2BE, histone genes that were also per-
turbed in a subset of germinal center B-cell DLBCLs.30
We identiﬁed frequent mutations in ZNF217 in 43% of PMBLs
(6 truncating, 13 missense, 1 other) (Figure 1A-C; supplemental
Figure 2B). ZNF217 binds to DNA and recruits several multi-
protein complexes that epigenetically regulate gene expression.42,59
Previous studies reported recurrent ampliﬁcations of 20q13,
which includes ZNF217, in several solid tumors, including
breast, colon, and hepatocellular carcinoma.42,59 In certain
solid tumor model systems, enforced expression of ZNF217
limited apoptosis, stimulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal tran-
sition, and increased proliferation.42 However, the mutational
pattern of ZNF217 in PMBL (Figure 1D; supplemental Figure 2B)
suggests an inactivating role. ZNF217 transcript levels were
similar in the subset of PMBLs with wild-type or mutated
ZNF217 and available gene expression proﬁles (supplemental
Figure 2C).
The most signiﬁcantly mutated gene in our PMBL cohort was
B2M, which encodes beta-2-microglobulin (b2M), the invariant
chain of the MHC class I. b2M is responsible for the correct
intracellular transport of MHC class I molecules to the plasma
membrane and is essential for the presentation of endogenously
degraded self- and non–self-antigens.60 B2M is also frequently
mutated in cHL28,61 and was reported to be infrequently mutated
in a targeted analysis of PMBL.62
Notably, we identiﬁed additional mutations in previously re-
ported modiﬁers of JAK/STAT signaling, including SOCS1 (35%
[13 of 37] at 32 sites), PTPN1 (14% [5 of 37] at 6 sites), and NF-kB
activation, including NFKBIE (19% [7 of 37] at 11 sites), that did
not reach statistical signiﬁcance in our analysis.
Mutational signature analysis
To further deﬁne the mutational processes operating in PMBL,
we used our SignatureAnalyzer tool63 (Figure 2; supplemental
Figure 3; supplemental Table 3) as we recently reported for
analyzing DLBCL.30 Interestingly, we discovered that 3 (8%) of 37
patients had a microsatellite instability (MSI) signature associ-
ated with defective DNA mismatch repair and MSI (Figure 2A;
supplemental Methods). As expected, these 3 samples were
associated with a hypermutation phenotype (Figures 1A 2A-B)
with a signiﬁcantly increased number of short indels (P 5 .0024;
1-tailed Mann-Whitney U test). The molecular bases for the
mismatch repair deﬁciency included frameshift mutations in
MLH1 in 2 tumors and biallelic likely inactivating mutations in
PMS2 in 2 tumors (1 tumor with cooccurring MLH1 and PMS2
mutations). The observed incidence of MSI-associated hyper-
mutations is similar in PMBL and cHL28 but is signiﬁcantly higher
than the prevalence of MSI in DLBCL (0.3%).30 These ﬁndings are
noteworthy because MSI has been associated with increased
sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in certain solid tumors.64-68
Despite the young age of our PMBL patient cohort, the majority
of remaining mutations were caused by spontaneous de-
amination of cytosines at cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs),
a genetic signature usually associated with older age at di-
agnosis (Figure 2A-B). The high frequency of mutations attrib-
uted to the aging signature (4.5 mutations/Mb) in young adults is
an additional shared feature of PMBL and cHL.28
In PMBL, as in cHL, the next most prevalent mutational signa-
tures were APOBEC and AID (Figure 2A-B).28 The APOBEC
signature was found in 7 (19%) of 37 PMBLs, which is of note
because APOBEC signatures have been associated with an
increased response to PD-1 blockade in non–small-cell lung

cancers.69 To identify putative molecular mechanisms of in-
creased APOBEC mutagenesis, we genotyped our PMBL pa-
tients with a high APOBEC signature for SNP rs12628403. This
SNP is a proxy for a short (30-kb) deletion that fuses the coding
region of APOBEC3A to the 39UTR of APOBEC3B and generates
a more stable chimeric transcript, APOBEC3AB, that has been
linked to increased APOBEC mutagenesis.70,71 We detected the
rs12628403 SNP in 8 of the 37 PMBL samples, including in 2 of
the 3 patients who had the highest APOBEC signatures (c_M_07
and c_M_1404). In fact, the APOBEC signature activity was
signiﬁcantly higher in patients who exhibited the rs12628403
SNP (hg19 chr22:39358037A.C; Wilcoxon rank-sum test
P 5 .032; supplemental Figure 3F).
Next, we assessed the relative contribution of the aging,
APOBEC, and AID signatures to the PMBL drivers (Figure 2C).
TP53 and HIST2H2BE mutations were exclusively caused by
spontaneous deamination of CpGs (aging), and XPO1 and
CSFR2B mutations were predominantly caused by the aging
mutational pattern (Figure 2C), as in cHL.28 In contrast, STAT6
was perturbed by each of the 3 mutational mechanisms (aging,
APOBEC, and AID (Figure 2C; supplemental Figure 3G-H). In
a combined analysis of 37 PMBLs and 3 PMBL cell lines, we
identiﬁed the above-mentioned mutational signatures and
detected 2 additional signatures, COSMIC11 and COSMIC15,
only in the PMBL cell lines. Whereas COSMIC15 is another
MSI-associated mutational signature, COSMIC11 is associated
with DNA damage caused by alkylating agents (supplemental
Figure 3D-E), likely reﬂecting the derivation of the PMBL cell
lines from heavily pretreated patients.
SCNAs and SVs
To detect SCNAs, we ﬁrst applied our copy number pipeline to
the WES data and identiﬁed 17 recurrent SCNAs by using the
GISTIC 2.0 algorithm,39 including 10 copy gains (2 focal and 8
arm level) and 7 copy losses (6 focal and 1 arm level) (Figure 3A;
supplemental Table 4). Copy gains of 9p/9p24.1/PD-L1/PD-L2
and 2p/2p16.1/REL were detected in 70% (26 of 37) and 36% (11
of 37) of PMBLs, respectively (Figure 3A; supplemental Figure 4).
These ﬁndings are in line with our previous reports and are the

bases for increased expression of PD-1 ligands and REL in
PMBL.15,18,24,72 Frequent focal copy losses included 6p21.33/
MHCI/MHCII, 6q23.3/TNFAIP3, and 15q15.1/B2M in 32%, 16%,
and 21% of the patients, respectively (Figure 3A; supplemental
Figure 4).
We detected SVs and deﬁned them at the base-pair level by
combining multiple algorithms (see “Methods”; supplemental
Table 5). These included CIITA SVs in 4 (11%) of 37 of the
patients, consistent with previous reports,21,22 and infrequent (2
of 37) SVs of PD-1 ligands, including a tandem duplication of
both PD-1 ligands and a deletion of the 39UTR of PD-L1 (Figure
3B-C). The latter has been reported as an additional mechanism
of PD-L1 deregulation in T-cell NHL (T-NHL) and DLBCL.73 In
addition, we identiﬁed 2 gain-of-function translocations in which
the immunoglobulin superenhancer74 is juxtaposed to either
BCL2 or WBP2 (Figure 3C). WBP2 is a recently described on-
cogene that functions as a transcriptional coactivator implicated
in the Hippo- and Wnt-signaling pathways in breast cancer.75
Cooccurrence of genetic alterations and perturbed
pathways
After identifying the recurrent genetic drivers in PMBL, we ex-
plored the patterns of genetic alterations in individual tumors
and the full series. For this reason, we generated a gene-sample
matrix of the recurrent CCGs, SCNAs, and SVs and performed 2-
way hierarchical clustering (Figure 4A; supplemental Table 6).
Multiple mechanisms of perturbing driver genes Combined
analyses of recurrent CCGs, SCNAs, and SVs revealed that certain
candidate driver genes were perturbed by multiple mechanisms
(Figures 4A and 5). Examples include TNFAIP3 alterations (59%
overall, 41% mutations, 24% focal copy loss, 6% biallelic) that in-
crease NF-kB signaling and B2M alterations (51% overall, 30%
mutations, 27% focal copy loss, 6% biallelic) (Figures 4A and 5) that
limit MHC class I antigen presentation.
Multiple mechanisms of perturbing signaling pathways and
immune recognition The combined analyses of the 3 types of
genetic alterations also revealed multiple mechanisms of per-
turbing speciﬁc signaling pathways (Figures 4A and 5). In par-
ticular, 81% (30 of 37) of the tumors exhibited 1 or more events
affecting components of the JAK/STAT pathway (Figures 4A and
5), including IL4R mutations (32%), 9p/9p24.1/JAK2 copy gain
(70%), STAT6 mutations (43%), CSFR2B mutations (14%), SOCS1
SVs (3%), and IRF2BP2 mutations (19%). Chromatin-perturbing
CCGs, including ZNF217, EZH2, HIST1H1E, and HIST2H2BE
mutations (Figure 1), were found in 57% (21 of 37) of PMBLs
(Figures 4A and 5).
A potential genetic basis of PD-1–mediated immune escape was
detected in 81% (30 of 37) of PMBLs. However, 73% (22 of 30) of
these PMBLs also had genetic alterations of antigen pre-
sentation pathway components, including B2M copy loss or
mutations, copy loss of 6q21.33 (which includes MHCI/MHCII),
mutations in EZH2, and SVs of CIITA (Figures 4A and 5).
Overall, we observed a convergence of genetic events in NF-kB
and JAK/STAT signaling pathways and perturbations in immune
recognition and epigenetic modulation (Figures 4A and 5). The
majority of these events were also detected in the 3 PMBL cell
lines, underscoring their utility as model systems of the disease
(Figure 4A, right panel). However, as described above, the cell
lines included additional mutational signatures reﬂecting, in
part, their previous treatment with alkylating agents (supple-
mental Figure 3E).
Additional genetic substructure Although the majority of
PMBLs exhibited 9p copy gain and frequent 6p21.33 copy loss,
hierarchical clustering revealed additional genetic substructure
(Figure 4A, left and right branches). PMBLs in the left branch of
the dendrogram included the 3 identiﬁed hypermutators and
additional tumors with a signiﬁcantly higher frequency of CCGs
(P 5 .0056, Mann-Whitney U test), including ZNF217 (P 5 .003,
Fisher’s exact test) and TNFAIP3 (P 5 .0136, Fisher’s exact test)
(Figure 4A; supplemental Figure 5A-B). Patients with tumors in
the left branch were signiﬁcantly more likely to be female (81%
female [left] vs 45% female [right]; P 5 .05, Fisher’s exact test)
and to be younger at diagnosis (33.5 years [left] vs 38 years
[right]) (supplemental Figure 5C-D), highlighting the potential
clinical relevance of the genetic substructure (Figure 4A).
Clonal and subclonal genetic events Next, we assessed purity
and ploidy of the PMBL series using ABSOLUTE37 (supplemental
Table 1). Thereafter, we estimated the cancer cell fraction for
each genetic alteration30 (ie, the fraction of tumor cells harboring
each genetic event). Of interest, the majority of recurrent genetic
alterations in PMBL were clonal (Figure 4B). Because PMBL
occurs predominantly in females, we speciﬁcally searched for
alterations that were enriched on the X chromosome and per-
formed an X chromosome–speciﬁc copy number evaluation
(data not shown). However, these analyses did not reveal X
chromosome–associated explanations for the predominance of
females in PMBL.
Assessment of antigen presentation pathways in
PMBL
As noted, the antigen presentation pathways in PMBL were
perturbed by multiple recurrent alterations, including B2M
mutations, focal copy number losses of B2M and the MHCI/
MHCII loci, and SVs of CIITA and EZH2 mutations (Figures 4A
and 5). EZH2 mutations were recently described as a mechanism
of reducing expression of MHC class I and MHC class II in
lymphomas.76 These ﬁndings prompted us to compare the
composite genetic signature to b2M, MHC class I, and class II
protein expression in our PMBL series (Figure 6A-D).
To this end, the 28 PMBLs with available tissue blocks were
stained for b2M, MHC class I, and MHC class II and scored by an
expert hematopathologist (S.J.R.) blinded to the genetic fea-
tures (Figure 6A). This analysis revealed that 46% (13 of 28), 43%
(12 of 28), and 75% (21 of 28) of tumor cells had detectable
(positive [H-score .100] or decreased [H-score 10-99]) mem-
branous expression of b2M, MHC class I, and MHC class II,
respectively (Figure 6A-B). As in cHL,77,78 we observed a sig-
niﬁcant correlation between the expression of b2M and MHC
class I in individual PMBLs (P , .0001 Spearman correlation;
Figure 6B); however, expression of MHC class I and MHC class II
were
independent
parameters
(Figure
6A;
supplemental
Figure 7A). Genetic perturbations in the MHC class I pathway
components were more common in tumors without MHC class I
expression (Figure 6A). The 3 PMBLs with EZH2 mutations lacked
MHC class I expression; 2 of these patients also lacked ex-
pression of MHC class II (Figure 6A).

The analyzed PMBLs largely had cell surface expression of both
MHC class I and MHC class II (Figure 6A,D, top row), cell surface
expression of only MHC class II (Figure 6A,D, bottom row), or
absent/decreased expression of both MHC class I and MHC
class II (Figure 6A,D, middle row). Of interest, we reported similar
patterns in cHL, in which expression of MHC class II, but not
MHC class I, was predictive for response to PD-1 blockade.78
After characterizing MHC class I and MHC class II expression in
this PMBL cohort, we assessed additional components of the
tumor immune inﬁltrate with a multiparametric spectral imaging
panel (PAX5, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, and 49,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole [DAPI]) and established methods.79 PMBLs with
higher levels of MHC class II expression had increased numbers
of tumor-inﬁltrating CD31/CD41 T cells (P 5 .08, Cuzick’s trend
test; supplemental Figure 7B-C). In addition, the number of
tumor-inﬁltrating CD681 macrophages was signiﬁcantly higher
in PMBLs that lacked MHC class I expression (P 5 .044, Cuzick’s
trend test; supplemental Figure 7D-E). Given the recently
described role of MHC class I in protecting tumor cells from
macrophage-mediated phagocytosis,80,81 the inverse relation-
ship between CD681 macrophage inﬁltration and MHC class I
expression in PMBL (supplemental Figure 7D-E) may have func-
tional relevance.
Comparison of genetic alterations in PMBL and
other lymphoid and solid malignancies
After identifying the recurrent genetic alterations (CCGs,
SCNAs, SVs) in this PMBL series, we compared their frequencies
to those in a recently described PMBL cohort82 and our own
comprehensively characterized series of cHL28 and DLBCL30
(Figure 7A; supplemental Figure 7A). Because a gene could be
perturbed in an entity but not reach the level of signiﬁcance for a
driver, we compared the raw frequencies of each alteration
(Figure 7A). Ten of the 15 CCGs and 4 SCNAs in our PMBL series
were also identiﬁed in the additional PMBL data set82 (supplemental
Figure 7A). Our cohort of PMBLs shared several genetic features
with cHL, including frequent copy gains of 9p/9p24.1/PD-1 ligands

and less common in PMBL and cHL (Figure 7A).28 TP53
mutations were detected at similar frequencies in DLBCL
(21%30) and PMBL (22%) (Figure 7A; compare left and right
columns). However, in contrast to DLBCL, in which a subset
of tumors exhibited biallelic alterations of TP53,30 PMBLs
harbored only monoallelic TP53 mutations (Figure 4). The
recurrent genetic alterations in PMBL were not coordinately
enriched in any of our recently deﬁned DLBCL genetic
clusters (C1-C5)30 (supplemental Figure 7B), highlighting the
distinctive features of large-cell lymphomas arising in the
mediastinum.
We also compared the mutational density of all, clonal, and
driver mutations in PMBL with those in the reported cancers from
The Cancer Genome Atlas project (Figure 7B). The median
mutational density (7.0 mutations/MB) in PMBLs was signiﬁcantly
higher than that in DLBCLs (P 5 8 3 1026, 1-sided Wilcoxon test)
and most solid cancers and comparable to that in bladder cancer
and lung adenocarcinomas (Figure 7B). In PMBL, the relatively
high mutational density may be an additional cause for increased
neoantigen production and responsiveness to PD-1 blockade.
Discussion
In this comprehensive genomic analysis of PMBL, we deﬁned re-
current mutations, SCNAs, and targeted SVs; assessed their clon-
ality; overlaid mutations on 3D protein structures; analyzed the
predominant mutation signatures in the coding genome; and com-
pared the molecular signature and mutational burden of PMBL to
that of related lymphoid malignancies and additional solid tumors.
In this report and in Wienand et al,28 we identiﬁed recurrent
genetic alterations of the NF-kB, JAK/STAT signaling and MHC
antigen presentation pathways that were shared by PMBLs and
cHLs (Figures 5 and 7A). Notably, it was necessary to capture all 3
types of recurrent genetic events—CCGs, SCNAs, and SVs—to
fully gauge the scope of these pervasive pathway alterations. We
also identiﬁed genetic alterations of speciﬁc epigenetic modi-
ﬁers (ZNF217 and EZH2), transcription factors (PAX5 and
IRF2BP2), and TP53 that were more common in PMBL than in
cHL (Figures 5 and 7A). Therefore, PMBLs have genetic features
and pathway perturbations that are common to cHL in addition to
more selective, potentially disease-deﬁning alterations (Figure 5).
Similarities between PMBL and cHL include a relatively high
mutational burden compared with that in other lymphoid and
solid cancers.28 Although PMBL and cHL are predominantly
tumors of young adults, these lymphomas have a high rate of
spontaneous deamination of CpGs, a clock-like mutational
signature that is typically associated with aging, potentially
reﬂecting a much higher division rate of the precursor B cells.28,83
In addition, both PMBLs and cHLs exhibit MSI and APOBEC
mutational signatures that have been associated with a more
favorable response to PD-1 blockade.28,69,84
Our analyses also revealed that PMBLs, like cHLs, exhibit mul-
tiple genetic bases of perturbed MHC class I expression and less
frequent decreased MHC class II expression (Figure 6A).28 The
relative levels of MHC class I and II expression by PMBLs also
impact the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment
(supplemental Figure 6B-D). Taken together, these data build
upon earlier observations regarding a targetable basis of immune
evasion in PMBL and cHL and provide a framework to compre-
hensively assess molecular mechanisms of response and resistance
to PD-1 blockade and develop rational combination therapies.
