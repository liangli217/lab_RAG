Glioblastomas are malignant neoplasms composed of diverse cell populations. This intratumoral diversity has an underlying
architecture, with a hierarchical relationship through clonal evolution from a common ancestor. Therapies are limited by
emergence of resistant subclones from this phylogenetic reservoir. To characterize this clonal ancestral origin of recurrent tumors,
we determined phylogenetic relationships using whole exome sequencing of pre-treatment IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastoma
specimens, matched to post-treatment autopsy samples (n = 9) and metastatic extracranial post-treatment autopsy samples (n = 3).
We identiﬁed “truncal” genetic events common to the evolutionary ancestry of the initial specimen and later recurrences, thereby
inferring the identity of the precursor cell population. Mutations were identiﬁed in a subset of cases in known glioblastoma genes
such as NF1(n = 3), TP53(n = 4) and EGFR(n = 5). However, by phylogenetic analysis, there were no protein-coding mutations as
recurrent truncal events across the majority of cases. In contrast, whole copy-loss of chromosome 10 (12 of 12 cases), copy-loss of
chromosome 9p21 (11 of 12 cases) and copy-gain in chromosome 7 (10 of 12 cases) were identiﬁed as shared events in the majority
of cases. Strikingly, mutations in the TERT promoter were also identiﬁed as shared events in all evaluated pairs (9 of 9). Thus, we
deﬁne four truncal non-coding genomic alterations that represent early genomic events in gliomagenesis, that identify the
persistent cellular reservoir from which glioblastoma recurrences emerge. Therapies to target these key early genomic events are
needed. These ﬁndings offer an evolutionary explanation for why precision therapies that target protein-coding mutations lack
efﬁcacy in GBM.

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain
tumor, with a poor prognosis. Therapies (including therapies that
target speciﬁc alterations) that have shown efﬁcacy in other
cancers have failed in GBM. In the past 3 decades, only a single
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent, temozolomide (TMZ), has been
approved and widely used for GBM and this drug only modestly
extends survival. Although the genomics of GBM at diagnosis have
been extensively characterized1–3, the existence and identity of
genomic drivers leading to GBM progression and recurrence
remain elusive.
Starting from a normal cell, cancers evolve via multiple rounds
of mutation, selection, and expansion.4, 5 Continued elaboration of
this phylogenetic process within the growing cancer-cell popula-
tion results in branched genetic variegation,6 whereby multiple
cancer subclones relate to each other in a phylogenetic tree-like
fashion.7 Consequently, cancer biospecimens are substantially
heterogeneous both across different anatomical regions8–11 and
within single cancer biopsies.11–15
GBM, when compared to many other cancers16, is a genetically
heterogeneous disease. Multiregional sampling of GBM at a single
timepoint commonly demonstrates signiﬁcant intratumoral het-
erogeneity.17–19 Studies of matched pre-treatment and recurrent
GBM after failure of therapy remain limited20–22 especially at the
extremes of disease, in large part due to the logistical challenges
associated with obtaining tissue at recurrence or the time of
death. The ongoing evolutionary processes leading to GBM
recurrence, and ultimately death of the patient, remain largely
uncharacterized.
Our objectives were to comprehensively characterize intratu-
moral heterogeneity and evolutionary patterns in GBM over the
entire course of clinical care, from initial diagnosis to time of
death. We initiated a GBM autopsy program at Massachusetts
General Hospital, which offers us the ability to compare the

evolution of genetic changes at diagnosis, during treatment, and
at the time of tumor progression and death. This served as the
basis for a phylogenetic analysis of GBM throughout the disease
course, as described herein.
RESULTS
We identiﬁed GBM patients from our autopsy tissue bank and
acquired pre-treatment tissue from diagnosis and matched post-
treatment autopsy tissue. We performed whole exome sequen-
cing of 12 GBM cases for which we had tumor tissue separated by
time (n = 10) and space (n = 2). Clinical characteristics of the 12-
patient case series are shown in Table 1. We also used a PCR-based
assay followed by next generation sequencing to evaluate the
presence and cancer cell fraction of the TERT promoter mutation.
We sequenced to high depth (mean target coverage 81X for the
exome, 21,459X for the TERT promoter Fluidigm assay). The mean
non-synonymous mutation rate in the post-treatment autopsy
samples (n = 12) was 1.78 mutations/Mb (range 1.04 to 2.63) and
the mean non-synonymous rate in the pre-treatment samples (n =
9) was 1.19 mutations/Mb (range 0.81 to 1.50), consistent with
prior reported mutation rates in GBM.2 There were no samples
that detectably exhibited a ‘hypermutator phenotype’, as has
been reported in a subset of GBMs23.
The
most
frequent
point
mutations
were
TERT
promoter
mutations, present in all patient cases where a Fluidigm assay was
available (n = 11/11). For one case (GS-05), targeted sequencing data
for the TERT promoter region was unavailable. Additionally,
mutations that were previously reported in GBM were detected at
a lower frequency compared to TERT alterations across our cohort,
including mutations in NF1 (n = 3 patients, 25% cases), EGFR (n = 5,
41.7% cases), TP53 (n = 4, 33.3%), RB1 (n = 1, 8.3%), TSC1 (n = 1, 8.3%).
The most frequent copy number alterations were loss of chromo-
some 10 and 9p21.3, as well as broad chromosome 7 gain, distinct
from focal EGFR ampliﬁcation (Fig. 1a).
We applied previously described computational methods12, 24–27
to address tumor heterogeneity and infer the evolutionary
relationship between the matched, sequenced tissue samples
from each patient. For each matched pre-treatment and post-
treatment autopsy sample, we integrated copy-number alterations
and somatic point mutation data to estimate a cancer-cell fraction
(CCF) for each mutation, which were then analyzed to construct
phylogenetic trees for clonality analysis to relate the cancer
subclones within each patient (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Figure 1A-I).
All paired cases (temporally distinct pre- and post-treatment
autopsy
samples
and
spatially
distinct
metastatic
autopsy
samples) demonstrated a branched evolution pattern, whereby
we detected a common ancestor (harboring truncal alterations),
with each sample demonstrating signiﬁcant subsequent genetic
divergence. We noted a striking difference in the truncal status
between
coding
alterations
compared
to
non-coding
and
structural alterations. Phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrated
that somatic exonic mutations, typically in the coding regions of
common GBM driver genes, occurred on all branches of the
phylogenetic tree, including in isolated subclonal branches
(Fig. 1a). However, there were no protein-coding mutations
identiﬁed as recurrent truncal events across the majority of the
cohort. In contrast, despite variable clinical presentations and
treatment courses, characteristic recurrent copy-number altera-
tions and the TERT promoter mutation events were near-
universally present clonally in the pre- and post-treatment autopsy
samples (Fig. 1b). Chromosome 10 deletion was clonal in both
matched samples in 9 of 9 cases (100%). Chromosome 7 copy-gain
was clonal in the pre- and post-treatment autopsy samples in 8 of
9 cases (89%), vs. clonal uniquely in the pre-treatment sample in 1
case (11%). Chromosome 9p21.3 deletion was clonal in both
matched samples in 8 of 9 cases (89%). TERT promoter mutations
were clonal in both pre-treatment and post-treatment autopsy
samples in 6 of 7 cases (86%) and subclonal in the pre-treatment
and clonal in the post-treatment sample in 1 case (14%). In this
latter case, the sample had clonal chromosome 10 and 9p21.3 loss
in
the
pre-treatment
and
post-treatment
autopsy
samples,
implying that the TERT promoter mutation can occur during
gliomagenesis, after chromosome gains and losses. We were

nucleotide variants, or SNVs, per Mb and small insertions and
deletions, or indels, per Mb) compared to the mutation rates
respectively in pre-treatment samples (mean 1.202 vs. 0.439; p =
0.0081, Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1). We
could not detect distinct mutational signatures in mutations
detected only in the post-treatment autopsy samples, although
we did detect signiﬁcantly more indels in post-treatment autopsy
samples than in pre-treatment samples (mean 0.096 vs. 0.015; p =
0.029, Mann-Whitney test), in addition to the overall higher
mutation rate (Fig. 3). Since all patients received radiation as part
of their care, we speculate that these are radiation-driven indels.
Recognizing the possibility that treatment with temozolomide
may in part account for the mutation rates observed in the post-
treatment autopsy samples, we examined the overall mutational
signature in these samples. The characteristic CpC > T temozolo-
mide signature was not detected in any case, suggesting that
factors other than exposure to temozolomide contributed to the
observed genetic divergence. Detailed evaluation of the muta-
tional signatures speciﬁc to pre-treatment and post-treatment
autopsy samples uncovered that cytosine to thymidine transitions
were predominant in both pre-treatment and post-treatment
autopsy cases, which can be attributed to the mutational
signature associated with spontaneous deamination of methy-
lated cytosines which occurs naturally and is associated with
number of cell divisions28, the so-called Signature 1 or “aging”
signature (Supplementary Figure 2).
The phylogenetic reconstruction of GBM provided potential
insights into possible mechanisms of resistance to different
therapies. Below we describe three representative cases that
represent a range of treatment regimens. In one case (Fig. 2a: GS-
15), a patient diagnosed with an IDH wildtype, MGMT promoter
methylated, right frontal GBM, underwent a gross total resection,
treatment
with
concurrent
temozolomide/radiation,
and
12 months of adjuvant temozolomide. 6 months after completion
of adjuvant treatment, the patient progressed, was treated with
dacomitinib (an oral irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of human
epidermal growth factor receptors, including EGFR and ERBB2),
experienced clinical and radiographic progression after 2 months
of therapy, and ultimately died. The pre-treatment and post-
treatment autopsy sample shared a common ancestor with shared
deletions (del9p21.3, del10), ampliﬁcations (focal EGFR ampliﬁca-
tion, amp7, amp19) and mutations (ERBB2 E744K, TERT promoter).
The pre-treatment sample harbored an additional broad chr20
ampliﬁcation
and
the
post-treatment
autopsy
sample
had
additional alterations, including a clonal six base pair in-frame
deletion in EGFR (p.C558_P560delinsS) which has not been
previously described. The EGFR indel may represent a resistance
mechanism that arose during treatment with the EGFR inhibitor.
Evolutionarily, this case illustrates a late phylogenetic event (EGFR
indel) altering the dominant treatment-resistant clone, forming a
“sequential” narrative of recurrence that is commonly envisioned
as the source of treatment resistance.
A second patient (Fig. 2b: GS-02) underwent a resection of a
frontal GBM, followed by combined radiation and temozolomide
then temozolomide for 6 months and after a clinical and
radiographic response, remained stable off of treatment for
6 months, when he was found to have recurrent disease. He
was initiated on a clinical trial of a MET inhibitor after his tumor
was found to have a c-MET ampliﬁcation. He progressed after
2 weeks of therapy, and was initiated on bevacizumab and
temozolomide with continued progression, and he ultimately died
1 month later. The primary and post-treatment autopsy tumor
shared a TERT promoter mutation, copy-loss of chromosome 10,
and
copy-gain
of
chromosome
7.
Thereafter,
phylogenetic
parsimony indicates that the pre-treatment and post-treatment
samples have a branched “sibling” relationship; neither branch is a
subclonal descendent of the other. Notably, the primary tumor
had a clonal high-level ampliﬁcation of MET (with an average of
over 70 copies of MET per cancer cell) that was not present in the
post-treatment autopsy sample after treatment with the MET
inhibitor. Thus, these data suggest that the primary tumor was in-
effect spatially heterogeneous, containing a minor reservoir of

TERT mutant, chr10 lost, chr7 gain, MET non-ampliﬁed precursor
cells that escape targeted therapy.
Similarly, a third patient (Fig. 2c: GS-06) underwent a subtotal
resection of a right temporal lobe GBM, followed by adjuvant
radiation,
temozolomide
and
an
mTOR
inhibitor
and
had
progressive disease 7 months later. He was initiated on the VEGF
inhibitor tivozanib for 2 months with poor tolerance, and
subsequently transitioned to a different VEGF inhibitor (bevacizu-
mab). He progressed after 4 months of bevacizumab mono-
therapy and died. His pre-treatment and post-treatment autopsy
tumors had shared deletions in 9p21.3, 22q, and chromosome 10,
ampliﬁcation of chromosome 7, and a mutation in the TERT
promoter. The pre-treatment sample had a high-level focal EGFR
ampliﬁcation, whereas the post-treatment autopsy sample did not
have the EGFR ampliﬁcation and had a number of additional
mutations and copy-number alterations including a high-level
focal MET ampliﬁcation. Increased c-Met expression and activity
may play a role in resistance during antiangiogenic therapy29–31. It
is possible that after receiving targeted therapy, episomal EGFR
ampliﬁcations may have been selected against as a result of the
treatment32. However, the presence of 17/152 total mutations
speciﬁc to the primary (vs. 70/152 mutations in the truncal MRCA
clone, and 65/152 total mutations speciﬁc to the relapse) suggests
evolutionarily that the recurrence is not merely a sequential loss of
episomal DNA, but rather outgrowth of a related subclone. These
latter representative examples (Figs. 2b,c) highlight the late
emergence of a highly-divergent clone derived from a shared
precursor pre-existing within a treatment-resistant reservoir.
DISCUSSION
We analyzed the genetic landscape of GBM at the extremes of
disease course using our unique biospecimen resource of autopsy
specimens. Comparing pre-treatment and autopsy specimens, we
demonstrated a common core of four early genetic events (loss of
chr10, chr9p21, gain of chr7 and TERT promoter mutations),
occurring before the divergence of primary tumor and post-
treatment tumor, which are detectable in virtually every case.
More generally, our results suggest that there is signiﬁcant
inter-patient heterogeneity with respect to protein coding (exonic)
mutations and that the key early events in GBM phylogeny are not
mutations in exonic regions. Exonic mutations in genes such as
TP53 and EGFR, although well-established and thought of as key
clinically-actionable mutations leading to recurrence and progres-
sion, were found in our cohort primarily as later events with
respect to GBM phylogeny, as evidenced by their presence on
both branches of the evolutionary tree and absence on its trunk. A
number of oncogenic alterations emerged after treatment with
targeted therapies, indicative of ongoing genomic evolution.
In contrast, we show that TERT promoter mutations are present
in nearly all cases, from pre-treatment and at the time of death.
Interestingly, in a single case the TERT promoter mutation was
initially subclonal and later became clonal, whereas the copy gains
and losses were clonal throughout, suggesting that the TERT
promoter mutation did not precede the copy number alterations,
and was therefore not a requirement for copy gains and losses.
Indeed, unlike other brain tumors such as meningomas33 where
copy number variations arise late during disease progression, our
data suggest that copy number changes are amongst the earliest
drivers of gliomagenesis.
Collectively, these core four alterations deﬁne the shared-origin
cell population from which later-emerging recurrences arise in the
majority of patients with GBM. Further studies may identify
additional truncal alterations contained within the shared-cell
precursor. Nevertheless, these alterations point towards the
signiﬁcance of non-coding and structural alterations in glioma-
genesis, with signiﬁcant implications for treatment strategy.
Therapies that target protein coding mutations have efﬁcacy in
other cancers but lack durable activity in GBM.34–36 Our ﬁndings
indicate this may be because these therapies do not target the

entire cellular reservoir, primarily characterized by non-coding and
structural changes. Comprehensive analysis of the functional roles
of these early events and development of novel therapeutic
strategies to target them should be given priority.
METHODS
We identiﬁed 12 GBM cases with temporally (n = 10) and spatially (n = 2)
distinct tumor tissue. The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. The study was reviewed and approved by the
human subjects institutional review board of the Dana-Farber Cancer/
Harvard Cancer Center. All patients provided written informed consent for
genetic analysis. A board-certiﬁed neuropathologist (M.F.) conﬁrmed the
histologic diagnoses and selected representative formalin ﬁxed parafﬁn
embedded samples that had an estimated purity of greater than or equal
to 40%.
Sequence data generation and pre-processing
Whole exome sequencing was performed using the sequencing platforms
at the Broad Institute. Details of whole exome library construction have
been previously described.37
A binary SAM ﬁle (BAM) ﬁle was generated for each sample using the
sequencing
data
processing
pipeline
known
as
“Picard”
(http://
broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).
Picard
consists
of
four
previously
described38 steps, detailed below.
(1) Alignment to the genome.
Alignment was performed using BWA39
(http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) to the NCBI Human Reference Genome
GRCh37/hg19. The reads in the BAM ﬁle are sorted according to their
chromosomal position. Unaligned reads are also stored in the BAM ﬁle
such that all reads that passed the Illumina quality ﬁlter (PF reads) are kept
in the BAM.
(2) Base-quality recalibration.
Each base is associated with a Phred-like
quality Q score representing the probability that the base call is erroneous.
The Q score represent −10*log (probability of error), rounded to an integer
value. In order to make sure that Q30 bases indeed have a 1 in a 1000
chance of being wrong we used a GATK tool (http://www.broadinstitute.
org/gatk) that empirically recalibrates the qualities based on the original Q
score (generated by the Illumina software), the read-cycle, the lane, the tile,
the base in question and the preceding base. The original quality scores
are also kept in the BAM ﬁle in the read-level OQ tag.
(3) Aggregation of lane and library-level data.
Multiple lanes and libraries
are aggregated into a single BAM per sample. Lane-level BAM ﬁles are
combined to library-level BAM ﬁles that are then combined to sample-level
BAM ﬁles. The BAM ﬁles contain read-groups that represent the library and
lane information. Information regarding the read groups appears in the
BAM header (see the BAM ﬁle speciﬁcations in http://samtools.sourceforge.
net/SAM1.pdf).
(4) Marking of duplicated reads.
Molecular duplicates are ﬂagged using
the MarkDuplicates algorithm from Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/
picard/). The method identiﬁes pairs of reads in which both ends map to
the exact same genomic position as being multiple reads of the same DNA
molecule and hence marks all but the ﬁrst as duplicates.
Targeted sequencing of TERT promoter region.
Targeted sequencing of the
TERT promoter region was also performed for each tumor sample using
Fluidigm sequencing technologies. A portion of the TERT promoter region
[273 bp; Chr5: 1,295,040–1,295,313 (hg19)] was ampliﬁed and sequenced
in 20 samples. These PCRs were carried out in two reactions. Round-1 PCR
primers
contained
target-speciﬁc
sequences
and
Illumina
adapter
sequences, producing a product of 341 bp. Round-2 PCR was a “tailing”
PCR in that PCR2 primers contained overlap of the Illumina adapter
sequence, as well as ﬂow cell attachment sequence, and an eight bp index
on the reverse primer between the adapter sequence and ﬂow cell
attachment sequence. This tailing PCR produced sequence-ready con-
structs of 398 bp that did not require further library construction. First-
round PCR was carried out using the Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase kit (Life
Technologies, Inc.). PCR1 reactions consisted of 50 ul: 2 ul DNA (at ~25 ng/ul),
3 ul mixed F/R tailed target-speciﬁc primer (at 20 uM mixed), 5 ul 10X Pfx
ampliﬁcation buffer, 1.5 ul dNTPs [at 10 mM each (Agilent Technologies)],
0.8 ul Pfx Platinum DNA polymerase, 1 ul MgSO4 (at 50 mM), 5 ul 10X Pfx
Enhancer Solution, and 31.7 ul nuclease free water. The polymerase (0.4 ul
polymerase + 1.6 ul water) was added to reactions after 1 min at 95 °C.
Thermal cycling consisted of 95 °C for 5 min (paused at 1 min to add
polymerase), 30 cycles of [95 °C 30 sec, 55 °C 30 sec, 68 °C 1 min]. A
sampling of PCR1 products (and negative control) were visually inspected
on the Lab Chip GX II Caliper Instrument (Perkin Elmer). Next, second-
round index-tailing PCRs were carried out using the HiFi Library
Ampliﬁcation kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc.). PCR2 reactions consisted of 60
ul: 10 ul PCR1 product, 12 ul 5X Kapa HiFi Fidelity Buffer, 1 ul dNTPs (25
uM), 1 ul Kapa HiFi HotStart Enzyme, 32 ul nuclease free water, and 4 ul
PCR2 F/R index-primer mix (25 uM mixed, plate of 96). Thermal cycling
consisted of 98 °C for 45 sec, 8 cycles of [98 °C 15 sec, 60 °C 30 sec, 72 °C 30
sec] and 1 min at 72 °C. Indexed amplicons were pooled in equal volumes
(96 reactions per pool), and puriﬁed using 1.5X solid-phase reversible
immobilization (SPRI) cleanup with Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Beckman
Coulter). Final amplicon library pools were visually inspected and
quantiﬁed on a BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The library was re-
quantiﬁed by SYBR green qPCR before denaturing and cluster generation.
PhiX library, derived from the well-characterized and small PhiX genome,
was spiked in at 15% to add diversity to single-amplicon clusters for
improved cluster imaging. One MiSeq run (2 × 150 bp paired end with
standard sequencing primers) was carried out for each pool of indexed
amplicons, using standard sequencing protocols (Illumina).
Cancer genome analysis pipeline
Whole exome sequencing data was analyzed using Firehose (developed at
the Broad Institute; https://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga). All tumor-
normal pairs passed the Firehose QC pipeline, which included testing for
DNA contamination of a sample from other individuals using the Contest
algorithm,40 as well as cross-checking lane ﬁngerprints. A more detailed
description of the QC pipeline can be found here.38
Identiﬁcation of somatic single nucleotide variants (SSNVs) and small
insertions and deletions (indels).
Candidate SSNVs were detected using
the point mutation calling algorithm MuTect,41 ran on each tumor-normal
pair. All mutations were ﬁltered using the oxoG ﬁlter, which ﬁlters
mutations that arise due to oxidation of a G base pair on only one strand
during fragmentation.42 Since the tumor samples analyzed for this study
were formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) samples, candidate SSNVs
were then ﬁltered using a Panel of Normals (PoN) ﬁlter, comprised of 374
FFPE normal samples. This step was taken to remove potential sequencing
artifacts and potential germline sites missed in the matched normal
sample. Mutant and reference allele counts were also estimated at known
hotspot mutation sites in the TERT promoter region (p.C228T and p.C250T)
in the Fluidigm targeted sequencing BAM ﬁles. Candidate indels were
detected using the Strelka indel calling algorithm43 on each tumor-normal
pair. Similarly to SSNV ﬁltering, indel calls were ﬁltered using the same PoN
ﬁlter. While many artifactual mutations were removed in the various
ﬁltering processes, we still manually reviewed all validated mutations to
remove further artifacts, which included mutations called on low mapping
quality reads, mutations called on reads which also contained indels and
other low allelic fraction point mutations, mutation supported only by
duplicate reads, mutations with strong orientation bias, as well as
mutations called in poorly mapping regions. In total, 141 mutations (3
indels, 138 SSNVs) were manually ﬁltered across 1,476 mutations calls from
all 12 patients (ﬁlter rate of 9.3%).
Identiﬁcation of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs).
A coverage
proﬁle for each tumor sample was estimated using the ReCapSeg
tool (http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/5640/recapseg-
overview). This tool works by ﬁrst normalizing read coverage over each
target segment with the total number of aligned reads. Next, coverage at
every segment is normalized against the coverage across a Panel of
Normals (PoN) generated from 25 normal FFPE samples sequenced using
the same target regions. Next, target regions are merged to form segments
corresponding to the same copy number event using the circular binary
segmentation algorithm.44 Allelic copy ratio was then estimated by
measuring allelic fraction of germline heterozygous SNPs in each tumor
sample (found in matched normal samples), and combining these
estimates with the observed copy ratio of each segment using the
AllelicCapseg tool (http://archive.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/acsbeta).
Finally, somatic copy number alterations were estimated by running the
ABSOLUTE algorithm,12 which maps allelic copy ratios to allelic copy

numbers via a linear transformation after correcting for purity and ploidy
of the sample.
Calculation of cancer cell fractions (CCFs) of SSNVs and indels, and
subsequent phylogenetic analysis.
The CCF distribution of each point
mutation (both SSNVs and indels) was estimated using ABSOLUTE. Point
mutations were force-called across each tumor sample belonging to each
patient; a process in which the aggregate set of all point mutations found
in each tumor sample belonging to a patient was formed, and the mutant
and reference allele counts in each sample estimated using samtools
(http://samtools.sourceforge.net/). Reads were only included if they had a
unique pair, had mapping quality greater than or equal to 5, and a base
quality at the site of interest greater than or equal to 20. The mutant and
reference allele counts for each mutation in the force-called set of
mutations was used as input to ABSOLUTE, which estimates the CCF
distribution of each point mutation based on purity and local ploidy of the
site.
Mutation CCFs were subsequently clustered across each individual using
a Bayesian clustering method. The ﬁnal clusters were found by sampling
from a Dirichlet process using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampler, as described here.24, 45 Five hundred MCMC iterations were used
to ﬁnd the ﬁnal number of clusters. Phylogenetic trees were then drawn for
each patient based on the CCF estimates of these clusters.
While our resolution to detect mutations at low cancer cell fraction is
limited, we can still estimate our power to detect mutations at a CCF of
0.05 given the tumor’s purity and local absolute copy number, calculated
as follows. For a mutation with coverage C (total number of reads mapping
to locus of mutation) in a sample with purity P, and total number of allelic
copies in the region containing the mutation, N, we calculate the expected
allele fraction of mutation with CCF of 0.05 as:
af¼
0:05P
2 1  P
ð
Þ þ NP
The power to detect a mutation at CCF of 0.05 at that locus is then:

C

Pr i; C; af

Þ; where Pr k; n; p

Þ is the binomial p:m:f:
We found that we had greater than 50% power to detect mutations at
CCF of 0.05 in 5 point mutations in driver genes which were found in a
clone not present in the primary but clonal in the metastasis (MSH6_p.
F11Y in PKB-GS-001, PTEN_p.I33T in PKB-GS-005, EGFR_p.A289V in PKB-GS-
009, SPEN_p.P3434S in PKB-GS-015, and EGFR_p.558_ in PKB-GS-015),
while 2 point mutations in driver genes had power to detect less than 50%
in similar clones (EGFR_p.C636F in PKB-GS-005 and MICALCL_p.G245fs in
PKB-GS-005). Although the MSH6_p.F11Y had one supporting read in the
primary sample in PKB-GS-001, it clustered with a clone with estimated
CCF of 0.01, below our threshold of subclonal presence of a clone.
