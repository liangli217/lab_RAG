Cancer is principally considered a genetic disease, and numerous mutations are thought essential to drive its growth.
However, the existence of genomically stable cancers and the emergence of mutations in genes that encode chromatin
remodelers raise the possibility that perturbation of chromatin structure and epigenetic regulation are capable of driving
cancer formation. Here we sequenced the exomes of 35 rhabdoid tumors, highly aggressive cancers of early childhood
characterized by biallelic loss of SMARCB1, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. We identified an
extremely low rate of mutation, with loss of SMARCB1 being essentially the sole recurrent event. Indeed, in 2 of the
cancers there were no other identified mutations. Our results demonstrate that high mutation rates are dispensable for the
genesis of cancers driven by mutation of a chromatin remodeling complex. Consequently, cancer can be a remarkably
genetically simple disease.

Cancer is principally considered a genetic disease, and numerous mutations are thought essential to drive its 
growth. However, the existence of genomically stable cancers and the emergence of mutations in genes that 
encode chromatin remodelers raise the possibility that perturbation of chromatin structure and epigenetic 
regulation are capable of driving cancer formation. Here we sequenced the exomes of 35 rhabdoid tumors, 
highly aggressive cancers of early childhood characterized by biallelic loss of SMARCB1, a subunit of the SWI/
SNF chromatin remodeling complex. We identified an extremely low rate of mutation, with loss of SMARCB1 
being essentially the sole recurrent event. Indeed, in 2 of the cancers there were no other identified mutations. 
Our results demonstrate that high mutation rates are dispensable for the genesis of cancers driven by muta-
tion of a chromatin remodeling complex. Consequently, cancer can be a remarkably genetically simple disease.
Introduction
Cancer is generally considered to arise due to DNA mutations 
that alter the function of numerous genes (1). Indeed, most cancer 
genomes are aneuploid, contain amplifications and deletions, and 
typically have hundreds to thousands of DNA point mutations. 
However, not all cancers are necessarily so complex as some highly 
aggressive tumors are diploid. Large-scale sequencing projects have 
revealed that mutation rates display 10- to 100-fold differences 
among cancer types and even among different cancers of the same 
type (2, 3). Even in cancer types possessing the highest mutation 
rates, there are often individual cases that contain many fewer muta-
tions. This raises a fundamental question about the nature of can-
cer: How simple can the genomes of highly aggressive cancers be?
Rhabdoid tumors (RTs) are a useful type of cancer with which 
to address these questions. These extremely aggressive pediatric 
cancers of the brain, kidney, and soft tissues are highly malignant, 
locally invasive, frequently metastatic, and particularly lethal (4), 
and yet, they are typically diploid and lack genomic aberrations 
detectable by SNP arrays (5). Early-onset cancers also offer the 
opportunity to examine cancer genomes prior to the acquisition 
of substantial numbers of age-related mutations, the vast majority 
of which are likely passenger mutations.
Near-uniform biallelic inactivating mutations in SMARCB1 (also 
known as SNF5, INI1, and BAF47), a gene that encodes a core sub-
unit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (6, 7), are 
a hallmark of RTs. Alterations in genes involved in chromatin 
remodeling, and particularly in genes encoding SWI/SNF subunits 
(8), are increasingly being identified in a wide variety of cancers, 
raising the possibility that epigenetic dysregulation may be a cen-
tral mechanism of oncogenesis.
Results and Discussion
We obtained DNA from 32 diagnostic pretreatment SMARCB1 
mutant RT samples, of which 20 were from brain, 3 were from kid-
ney, and 9 were from other soft tissues (Supplemental Table 1; sup-
plemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI64400DS1). The median age of the patients was 12 months. 
Matched non-tumor peripheral blood DNA was also obtained from 
each patient. Whole-exome sequencing and SNP array analysis was 
performed on all 32 sample pairs. Analysis of SNP arrays identified 
a single region with significant focal somatic copy number altera-
tions (SCNAs): deletions at 22q11.23 that contained the SMARCB1 
gene were identified in 25 out of the 32 samples (GISTIC2.0, ref. 9; 
q < 10–50), which comprised focal deletions in 16 cases, monosomy 
22 in 15 cases, and both in 6 cases (Figure 1). One sample (08-262A) 
had a germ line focal deletion. Tumor purity ranged from 43% to 
97%, so the lack of additional detected SCNAs was not likely due to 
stromal contamination (Supplemental Table 2).
We next performed exome sequencing of DNA to a mean cover-
age of 83-fold across 32.6 Mb of targeted coding regions for each 
sample (Supplemental Table 3). This level of coverage resulted in 
a “call-able” exome of 28.6 Mb. Detection of SCNAs by sequenc-
ing data was consistent with SNP array findings (Supplemental 
Figure 1). Analysis revealed a total of 172 somatic substitutions 
and insertions/deletions (indels) in the 32 tumors (Table 1 and 
Supplemental Table 12). Other than SMARCB1 loss, 2 tumors 
(08-114 and 09-223) had no detectable mutations, and 4 tumors 
(07-057, 07-221, 08-172, and 09-131) had only subclonal muta-
tions (Figure 2A). The mean mutation rate was 0.19 mutations 
per Mb, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 0.45 mutations 
per Mb. This rate is, to our knowledge, the lowest of all cancers 
sequenced to date, particularly for such a high-grade and lethal 
type of cancer (Figure 2B). Consistent with our tumor selection 
process, all tumors had combinations of SMARCB1 mutations 
and/or deletions predicted to cause homozygous loss of function 
(Supplemental Table 4 and Supplemental Figures 3 and 6). Over-

all, 71.5% of the mutations were classified as clonal. All 7 of the 
point mutations in SMARCB1 were classified as clonal (Figure 2A 
and Supplemental Table 5).
We looked for recurrent mutations that may cooperate with 
SMARCB1 loss to drive RTs. The only other recurrently mutated 
gene was GABRB2, a subunit of the GABA A receptor, which was 
found to be clonally mutated in 2 out of the 32 samples (10-330 
and SJDOS006; Supplemental Figure 4). However, the Catalog 
of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC v51) database con-
tains only 2 other instances of this gene being mutated, neither of 
which matched the RT mutations (10, 11). Only 2 mutations found 
among the 32 sequenced RTs, aside from SMARCB1 and GABRB2, 
were present in the COSMIC database: 1 in NF2 (10-213) and the 
other in TP53 (10-330). The NF2 nonsense mutation (Y144*) may 
have been contributory; although subclonal (26% of cells), the muta-
tion was present on a background of hemizygous deletion, implying

homozygous loss in the mutant subclone. The relevance of the TP53 
mutation (D49N) was unclear; although clonal, the variant did not 
occur in one of the canonical mutation domains and was predicted 
not to be detrimental.
In addition to the 32 primary samples, we analyzed 3 indepen-
dent recurrent tumor/normal pairs after chemotherapy (Supple-
mental Table 6). Sample 09-044 was found to be aneuploid (Figure 
3A). The range of purity and coverage was comparable to that in 
the primary samples (Supplemental Tables 7 and 8). While the 
largest number of mutations per sample found in the 32 primary 
tumors was 13, the recurrent cancers contained 38, 47, and 47 
mutations, resulting in a rate of 1.53 mutations per Mb (Supple-
mental Table 9), 8 times higher than that in the primary tumors 
(Figure 3B; P < 0.005). Other than SMARCB1, which was homo-
zygously lost in all 3 recurrent samples (Supplemental Table 10), 
none of the mutations matched any in the COSMIC database and 
no gene contained recurrent, clonal mutations (Supplemental 
Figure 5). Notably, the treated samples had significantly more 
subclonal mutations than the primary tumors (P = 7 × 10–4; Fig-
ure 2A and Supplemental Table 11). Despite their absence from 
the COSMIC database, we could not exclude the possibility that 
these mutations could be conferring a growth advantage for sub-
clones that could ultimately contribute to recurrent or refractory 
disease. Regardless, these mutations are unlikely to constitute 
effective therapeutic targets up front, given their absence from the 
predominant cancer population.
The mutational profile was also distinct in the recurrent sam-
ples, as they contained a significantly reduced proportion of C→T 
transitions (P < 10–5, 2-proportion z test) and increased propor-
tions of A→T (P < 0.05) and C→A (P < 0.005) transversions (Fig-
ure 3C). Overall, the recurrent tumors had a greater percentage of 
transversions (P < 10–4; Figure 3D and Supplemental Figure 2).
In part based upon the large number of mutations commonly 
present in tumors, genetic alterations that affect numerous pro-
tein coding genes have typically been considered a fundamental 
requirement for cancer development. The finding that SMARCB1 
is the sole gene recurrently mutated at high frequency in extreme-
ly aggressive and lethal RTs, and in some cases may be the only 
mutated gene, prompts essential questions: What accounts for the 
extreme paucity of mutations, and how can these data be recon-
ciled with current models of cancer that estimate that 5 to 15 driv-
ing mutations are required for oncogenesis (12)?
We considered 4 possible explanations. First, as we have only 
sequenced exome DNA, we cannot exclude the existence of muta-
tions in noncoding portions of the genome, such as in noncoding 
RNAs or regulatory elements or in mutations in low coverage areas. 
Further, we cannot exclude balanced translocations or inversions, 
although these are not characteristic of RTs by karyotype (13). None-
theless, occult events could cooperate with SMARCB1 loss. Second, 
as mutations were largely identified based upon differences between 
tumor and normal DNA, contributions from germ line events are 
difficult to exclude. However, since genetically engineered models 
have demonstrated that inactivation of Smarcb1 drives extremely 
rapid formation of cancer in all mice and since this occurs on sev-
eral genetic backgrounds (14, 15), it seems unlikely that germ line 
alterations are essential for cancer formation driven by SMARCB1 
loss. Third, the developmental stage/epigenetic state may serve a 
contributory role. During development, there is relative enrichment 
of minimally differentiated cell populations that have a high prolif-
erative capacity. Consequently, it is possible that developmentally 
restricted or lineage-specific populations of cells characterized by a 
certain epigenetic state are particularly susceptible, such that muta-
tion of a single chromatin remodeler can drive transformation. This 
is consistent with our mouse model in which Smarcb1 deletion in the 
T cell lineage leads to transformation of a highly specific cell type, 
CD8+CD44hiCD122lo memory T cells, a population that has a high 
intrinsic capacity for proliferation. Notably, this transformation 
arises due to aberrant responses to lineage-specific T cell receptor

signaling caused by SMARCB1 loss (16). Such specificity in lineage 
effects could explain why mutation of SMARCB1 is largely restricted 
to RTs and a few other cancers. It should be noted that the SWI/SNF 
complex contributes to differentiation control in many tissues and 
that several other members of the SWI/SNF complex are mutated 
across a variety of adult cancers, including subsets of ovarian and 
renal cancer, among other cancers, with each mutated subunit hav-
ing a distinct profile of associated cancers (8, 17–19). We speculate 
that this specificity may be related to epigenetic state and distinct 
roles for the subunits in modulating interactions with particular 
transcription factors. Fourth, it is conceivable that 5 to 15 is an 
overestimation of the number of mutations required for oncogenic 
transformation. While adult cancers that arise in tissues exposed 
to mutagens, such as those of skin, lung, and the gastrointestinal 
tract, generally contain an extremely high number of mutations, 
other adult cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 
breast cancer, are typically much simpler. Similarly, pediatric can-
cers, such as osteosarcomas, have extremely complex genomes, while 
retinoblastomas, poorly differentiated but generally good prognosis 
cancers, have extremely low mutation rates (20, 21). Regardless of 
the explanation, our data from RTs demonstrate that collaboration 
between multiple coding mutations is not essential for the genesis 
of extremely aggressive and highly lethal cancers.
It is interesting that a type of cancer that has extremely few 
gene mutations at the time of initial diagnosis is characterized by 
a much higher number of mutations in recurrent samples. The 
reason for this is unclear. While we do not have specific treatment 
data, these patients were treated with chemotherapy and poten-
tially radiation therapy. It is possible that genotoxic chemotherapy 
directly causes such damage. This possibility is supported by the 
presence in recurrent samples of a high percentage of transver-
sions, a mutation type known to be associated with chemotherapy 
and similarly seen in recurrent AML (22). This raises the possibil-
ity that chemotherapy can cause the conversion of a remarkably 
simple cancer genome into one with 8-fold more mutations, a 
possibility with substantial clinical implications, as such muta-
tions could potentially contribute to resistance. Alternatively, the 
selective pressure of chemotherapy may result in the outgrowth of 
subclones with high rates of mutation, or, conceivably, the funda-
mental nature of the recurrent disease has changed such that these 
cancers have acquired genetic instability and a high mutation rate.
Finally, while there is increasing evidence that epigenetic regula-
tors are mutated in a large variety of cancers, it has been unclear 
whether these alterations are selected for because they act to facili-
tate genomic instability, because they potentiate the effects of 
other mutations, or because they directly drive oncogenic trans-
formation. Particularly in cancers in which mutations in chroma-
tin regulators exist in a genetically complex background, it has 
been extremely difficult to determine the relative contribution of 
epigenetic alterations. Our findings from RTs demonstrate that 
mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex can 
act as potent drivers of cancer. Understanding the contributions 
of mutations in these remodelers to oncogenesis has the potential 
to facilitate development of targeted therapies for the wide variety 
of SWI/SNF mutant cancers.
Methods
Samples. Tumor tissue and matched blood from 32 newly diagnosed patients 
with cancer and from 3 recurrent tumors were collected. Mutation and dele-
tion analysis of the SMARCB1 gene was performed as previously described 
(6). Tumors were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and to estimate tumor 
content (The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Hospital Sant Joan de 
Déu). DNA was extracted using standard techniques.
SNP arrays. All of these samples were processed and hybridized to 
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays for genotyping and copy number analysis (2). 
SNP array data were further analyzed using the ABSOLUTE tool (23) to 
infer the tumor purity and ploidy (11, 24, 25).
Whole-exome sequence data. Library construction followed the procedure of 
previous publications (11, 24, 25). Descriptions of sequencing and analysis 
methods are in the Supplemental Methods. Data were deposited in dbGaP 
(accession no. phs000508). The complete list of all detected mutations can 
be found in Supplemental Table 12.
Statistics. Comparison of mutation rates was performed using a 2-tailed 
Welch’s t test for samples with unequal variance. Two-proportion z test 
and Pearson’s χ2 test with a Yates’s correction for continuity were used 
to analyze the different proportions of mutation type. Subclonal muta-
tion frequency was analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Data in figures are 
shown as mean ± SEM.
