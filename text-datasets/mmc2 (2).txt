In brief
Sklavenitis-Pistoﬁdis et al. report results
of a phase II trial of EloLenDex in patients
with high-risk smoldering multiple
myeloma and use single-cell RNA
sequencing to identify biomarkers of
outcomes. They show that immune cell
composition affects progression-free
survival and that blood-based immune
proﬁling can detect immune alterations

SUMMARY
Patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) are observed until progression, but early treatment may
improve outcomes. We conducted a phase II trial of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone
(EloLenDex) in patients with high-risk SMM and performed single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR)
sequencing on 149 bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from patients and healthy donors
(HDs). We ﬁnd that early treatment with EloLenDex is safe and effective and provide a comprehensive charac-
terization of alterations in immune cell composition and TCR repertoire diversity in patients. We show that the
similarityof a patient’simmune cellcomposition to that of HDs mayhaveprognosticrelevance at diagnosisand
after treatment and that the abundance of granzyme K (GZMK)+ CD8+ effector memory T (TEM) cells may be
associated with treatment response. Last, we uncover similarities between immune alterations observed in
the BM and PB, suggesting that PB-based immune proﬁling may have diagnostic and prognostic utility.
INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy
that resides in the bone marrow (BM) and is preceded by an
asymptomatic condition called smoldering MM (SMM) (Weiss
et al., 2009). Approximately half of patients with SMM progress
within 5 years from diagnosis, but not all patients with SMM prog-
ress (Kyle et al., 2007; Mateos et al., 2020). Therefore, patients
with SMM are observed until end-organ damage occurs, which
signiﬁes progression to overt MM, warranting treatment (Visram
et al., 2021). Two phase III clinical trials, testing lenalidomide/
dexamethasone (LenDex) or Len alone (Len) versus observation,

demonstrate that early treatment can signiﬁcantly prolong pro-
gression-free survival (PFS) in patients with high-risk SMM
(HRSMM) and, in one instance, sustainably prolong overall sur-
vival(OS)(Mateosetal.,2013,2022;Lonialetal.,2020).Identifying
patients who will beneﬁt the most from early intervention remains
an unmet clinical need (Kim et al., 2020; Mateos and San Miguel,
2015). Currently, patients withHR of progression are identiﬁed us-
ing predictionmodels based on clinical variables (Kyleet al.,2007;
Pe´ rez-Persona et al., 2007), such as the ‘‘20-2-20’’ model devel-
oped by theInternational MyelomaWorking Group (IMWG),which
stratiﬁes patients based on BM plasma cell inﬁltration (>20%), the
amountofMprotein intheserum (>2 g/dL),andthefreelight-chain
ratio (>20) (Mateos et al., 2020). In recent years, it has become
evident that genomic biomarkers detected through cytogenetics
and sequencing, including translocations t(4;14) and t(14;16),
gain or ampliﬁcation of chromosome 1q (chr1q), del13q, del17p,
translocations and copy number abnormalities (CNAs) involving
MYC, and KRAS mutations, may be associated with faster pro-
gression in untreated patients with SMM (Mateos et al., 2020;
Bustoros et al., 2020; Misund et al., 2020; Boyle et al., 2021; Bolli
et al., 2018; Oben et al., 2021). Tumor-extrinsic microenviron-
mental factors are important for disease control at early stages,
and the BM immune microenvironment is altered in composition
and functionality in patients with SMM (Zavidij et al., 2020; Bailur
et al., 2019; Dhodapkar et al., 2003; Das et al., 2016). However, lit-
tle is known about the role of BM-based immune proﬁling in pa-
tient prognostication and the utility of peripheral blood (PB) for
detection of immune alterations related to disease.
Here we conducted a phase II trial of the immunotherapeutic
anti-SLAMF7 antibody elotuzumab in combination with LenDex
(EloLenDex;
EloLenDex-PRecision
Intervention
Smoldering
Myeloma (E-PRISM) study; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02279394)
to determine the utility and safety of early immunotherapy in pa-
tients with HRSMM. We performed correlative DNA sequencing
studies on 34 BM samples at baseline (BL) and single-cell RNA
and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing studies on 149 serial BM
and PB samples from patients and healthy donors (HDs) to iden-
tify genomic and immune biomarkers for optimal patient selec-
tion and monitoring of response to treatment.
RESULTS
Early treatment with Elo, Len, and Dex is safe and
effective in patients with HRSMM
We conducted a phase II trial of EloLenDex in patients with
HRSMM (n = 51). Enrollment in E-PRISM was based on the
HRSMM criteria by Rajkumar et al. (2015). The primary objective
was to determine the proportion of patients with HRSMM who
were progression free 2 years after treatment. Patients were
initially randomized 1:1 to arm A (EloLenDex, n = 40) or arm B
(EloLen, n = 11), but accrual to arm B was halted early because
the difference in exposure to steroids was negligible between the
two arms because of the premedication requirement for Elo
infusion. Treatment was planned for 24 cycles followed by
observation until progression to overt MM. Stem cell collection
was allowed for eligible patients. The BL characteristics of all pa-
tients are listed in Table 1, and the trial schema and Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram are shown in
Figures S1A and S1B.
Treatment-related grade 3–5 adverse events (AEs) with at
least 10% frequency were hypophosphatemia (n = 19/51,
37%), neutropenia (n = 13/51, 26%), and lymphocytopenia (n =
11/51, 22%). Thromboembolic events occurred in 6 patients
(12%), and no secondary leukemias were observed. Treat-
ment-related grade 2 adverse events with at least 10% fre-
quency and all grade 3–5 events are summarized in Table 2
and Figure S1C. Overall, two deaths occurred: one because of
uncontrolled diabetic ketoacidosis, bowel perforation, and sep-
tic shock at cycle 19 and another because of hypertensive crisis
and myocardial infarction at cycle 24 (Figure S1B).
Median follow-up for all 51 patients was 50 months (range,
2–67). Six patients had PFS events, deﬁned as progression to
myeloma-deﬁning events (n = 4) or death (n = 2). Median PFS

and OS were not reached for the 46 patients who were eligible
for the study and received at least two full treatment cycles;
PFS was 88.7% at 48 months (90% conﬁdence interval [CI],
81.2%–96.9%), and OS was 95.6% at 48 months (90% CI,
90.6%–100%) (Figure S1D). The Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS
for eligible patients who received at least two cycles is de-
picted in Figure 1A.
The overall response rate (partial response or better) for these
patients was 87% (n = 40). Three patients (7%) experienced a
best overall response of stringent complete response, 1 patient
(2%) achieved complete response, 14 patients (30%) achieved
very good partial response, 22 patients (48%) achieved partial
response, and 6 patients (13%) achieved minor response
(Table S1).
Overall, approximately 13% (n = 6) of all patients and 20%
(n = 3) of patients deﬁned as having HRSMM by the 20-2-20
criteria experienced progression or death within 4 years
of follow-up (Figure S1E). Without treatment, approximately
80% of patients with HRSMM as deﬁned by the 20-2-20
criteria
are
expected
to
progress
within
5
years
of
follow-up (Mateos et al., 2020). Our data suggest that early
treatment with EloLenDex was safe and effective in patients
with HRSMM.
Genomic predictors of PFS in patients with HRSMM
treated with EloLenDex
We observed three main categories of progression in our cohort:
those who developed overt myeloma (n = 4), those who were
treated based on evolving biomarkers and the physician’s deci-
sion (n = 4), and those who presented biochemical progression
(n = 19). For two of the four individuals who developed overt
MM and had samples available for testing, we performed
whole-exome sequencing (WES) on CD138+ BM cells taken at
BL and end of treatment (EOT) to assess whether early treatment
had selected for aggressive subclones with HR genetic abnor-
malities. Both individuals had HR genomic features at BL: pro-
gressor patient 1 had del17p and a TP53 single-nucleotide
variant (SNV), and progressor patient 2 had t(4;14), del1p, and
TP53 and KRAS SNVs. We did not observe selection of sub-
clones carrying abnormalities associated with increased risk of
progression (Figures 1B and 1C). In progressor patient 1, several
large-scale CNAs increased in frequency with treatment,
although none are known to be associated with an increased
risk of progression. In both patients, we observed a post-treat-
ment contraction of potentially aggressive subclones that
harbored amp1q (progressor patient 1), and del1p and a TP53
SNV (progressor patient 2), suggesting that, in some instances,
early treatment can alter the tumor’s clonal dynamics.
A total of 15 patients showed no evidence of clinical or
biochemical progression, suggesting that our patient selection
can improve to identify patients with HRSMM who are more likely
to beneﬁt from early treatment. Although our study was under-
powered, we did not observe a signiﬁcant association between
20-2-20 risk staging and PFS in our cohort or the treatment
arm in Lonial et al. (2020) (Figures S2A and S2B). To search for
genomic biomarkers of PFS, we performed WES (n = 31) and
deep targeted sequencing (DTS) (n = 3) on BM samples collected
at BL to detect coding genetic alterations and explore their asso-
ciation with patient outcomes (Figure 1D). Testing events present
in at least 3 individuals, del17p, t(4;14), and del16q, were signif-
icant predictors of PFS at the univariate level, whereas del17p
was an independent predictor of progression at the multivariate
level (Figures 1E and 1F). These results are consistent with our
prior study showing that del17p is a risk factor for progression
in untreated patients with SMM (Bustoros et al., 2020) and sug-
gest that patients with SMM and del17p may need a different or
longer regimen to prolong PFS, a hypothesis that requires valida-
tion in larger cohorts.
Comprehensive characterization of changes in the BM
immune cell composition and TCR repertoire of patients
with HRSMM
Next we set out to explore whether immune proﬁling can help to
identify patients with HRSMM who are more likely to beneﬁt from
EloLenDex. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on
211,374 immune cells from 149 samples of 34 patients enrolled
in E-PRISM (60 CD138 BM mononuclear cell samples at BL [n =
28], cycle 9 day 1 [C9D1; n = 16] and EOT [n = 16], and 68 PB
mononuclear cell [PBMC] samples at BL [n = 33], cycle 4 day 1
[C4D1; n = 1], C9D1 [n = 13], and EOT [n = 21]) and 21 age-
matched HDs (BM samples [n = 11] and PBMCs [n = 10]). We
also integrated E-PRISM data with our cohort of non-trial pa-
tients

signiﬁcance (MGUS; n = 6), low-risk SMM (LRSMM; n = 3),
HRSMM (n = 12), newly diagnosed MM (NDMM; n = 9), and
HDs (n = 11) (Zavidij et al., 2020), reaching a total of 190 samples
and 231,608 cells (Figures 2A–2L). For 9 samples, we thawed
two cell vials and found that the inter-replicate divergence of im-
mune cell composition was signiﬁcantly lower compared with
cross-replicate estimates, suggesting that the quantiﬁcation of
immune cell composition is reproducible (Figure S3A). To assess
whether RNA-based quantiﬁcation is consistent with protein-
based estimates, we performed cytometry by time-of-ﬂight
(CyTOF) on 17 BM samples (10 drawn at BL and 7 drawn at
EOT) with matched single-cell RNA sequencing data and
observed signiﬁcant positive correlation between protein-based
and
RNA-based
abundance
estimates
(Figure
S3B).
By
comparing the BM immune cell composition of patients with
HRSMM at BL (n = 32) and HDs (n = 19) with at least 100 cells,
we observed a signiﬁcant increase in the abundance of naive
and memory CD4+ T cells (including regulatory T [Treg], Th1,
Th2, and Th17 cells), granzyme B (GZMB)-expressing CD8+
T cells, and CD56dim natural killer (NK) cells in patients and a
signiﬁcant decrease in the abundance of CD14+ monocytes,
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), AXL+ SIGLEC6+ DCs (AS-
DCs), progenitor cells, and immature B cells (Figure 3A). We
observed a relative decrease in the abundance of mucosa-asso-
ciated invariant T (MAIT) cells in patients, a shift from CD14+ to
CD16+ monocyte subpopulations, and a bias toward memory
B cells (Figures S4A–S4C).
Next we set out to characterize changes in the TCR reper-
toire of patients compared with HDs and performed single-
cell TCR sequencing on 91 samples with available single-cell
RNA sequencing data. Speciﬁcally, we proﬁled 70 BM and
PB patient samples drawn before and after therapy (BM: 14
at BL, 3 at C9D1, 2 at EOT; PB: 26 at BL, 8 at C9D1, 17 at
EOT) and 21 samples from HDs (BM, 11; PB, 10). To control
for variability in T cell numbers, which can affect diversity
estimates, we randomly sampled a range of T cell numbers
(n = 75–300) from each sample over 100 iterations and aver-
aged repertoire
diversity estimates
across iterations.
We
observed that patient BM TCR repertoires were signiﬁcantly
less diverse compared with those of HDs, as assessed by the
Chao index, independent of the number of T cells sampled
(Figure 3B). The observed decrease in repertoire diversity ap-
peared to be driven by broad low-level clonal expansion rather
than a targeted expansion of a few large clones dominating the
repertoire (Figure 3C). Treg cells and GZMB+ CD8+ TEM cells
from patient BM were more likely to be part of an expanded
clone compared with those from HD BM, where clonal expan-
sion was contained within cytotoxic populations (Figures 3D
and 3E). This ﬁnding is consistent with the increase in Treg
cell and GZMB+ CD8+ TEM cell abundance observed in patient
BM and suggests that these cells may be expanding in an
antigen-speciﬁc manner. To gain more insight into the pheno-
type of clonally expanded GZMB+ CD8+ TEM cells in patients,
we compared their gene expression with that of clonally
expanded GZMB+ CD8+ TEM cells from HDs (Figure 3F).
Compared with HDs, clonally expanded cytotoxic T cells from
patients expressed higher levels of ZNF683 (which encodes
the tissue residence transcription factor Hobit), the senescence
markers KLRG1 and B3GAT1 (which encode CD57), genes
associated
with
effector
function
(ITGB1,
ITGA4,
ITGB2,
ITGB7, S100A4, S100A10, S100A6, TNF, PRF1, CCL5, and
GZMH), and genes induced by interferon signaling (STAT1,
XAF1, IFITM1, and IFITM2) and lower levels of genes related
to induction of potent cytotoxic responses (GZMB, FGFBP2,
TBX21, PRDM1, EOMES, and IFNGR1) or granule formation
and degranulation (VAMP2, OCD1, and SRGN). These results
suggest that, despite their increased abundance in patient
BM, cytotoxic T cells may be dysfunctional. Further mecha-
nistic studies are required to determine the effect of these
changes on T cell functionality and tumor clearance.
Immune reactivity at BL and post-therapy immune
normalization are associated with longer PFS in patients
with HRSMM treated with EloLenDex
We hypothesized that the similarity of a patient’s BM immune
cell composition to that ofHD could be harnessed for prognostica-
tion. We trained a naive Bayes classiﬁer with 10-fold cross-valida-
tion and 100 iterations on a training set of 41 BM samples from
patients and HDs to predict the presence of malignancy based
onthecompositionoftheBMimmunemicroenvironment;theclas-
siﬁerachieved94% accuracyinthe testing set (n= 16;FigureS5A).
We then computed a weighted sum score of the product of each
cell type’s proportion and its corresponding signed importance
to the classiﬁcation (‘‘normalization score’’) and classiﬁed patients
based on the median score at BL as reactive (least normal like) or
non-reactive (most normal like) (Figure 4A). Patients who were
classiﬁed asreactiveatBLhad signiﬁcantlylongerPFS(Figure4B).
Immune
reactivity
was
independent
of
the
patients’
risk
stage but signiﬁcantly associated with the presence of del17p,
although patients with del17p were only a fraction of the non-reac-
tive group (Figures 4C and 4D). pDCs and pro-inﬂammatory
cytokine+ CD14+ monocytes, which expressed genes related to
neutrophil chemotaxis and acute inﬂammation, were among the
top 3 cell types with the highest importance for a sample to be
classiﬁed as normal like. Aside from monocytes, this pro-inﬂam-
matory signaling was also active in DCs and pDCs (gene

effectors (IL7R and CD27),markers associated withterminal effec-
tors (GZMB, GZMH, FCGR3A, FGFBP2, and NKG7), and markers
associated with functionality (IFNG and TNF), a proﬁle consistent
with long-lived memory effector cells of increased potency (Fig-
ure 4F). In GZMB+ CD8+ TEM cells from reactive patients, we
observed upregulation of exhaustion markers (TIGIT and LAG3)
and the senescence marker KLRG1, along with higher levels of
IFNG and TNF, and downregulation of cytotoxicity markers
(GZMB, FCGR3A, and PRF1), a proﬁle consistent with exhausted,
senescent terminal effector cells (Figure 4G). Consistent with the
hypothesis that these cells may be exhausted because of chronic
antigenic stimulation, GZMB+ CD8+ TEM cells from reactive pa-
tients were more likely to be clonally expanded compared with
those from non-reactive patients (Figure 4H). These results sug-
gest that immune reactivity captures a patient subpopulation
with decreased pro-inﬂammatory myeloid signaling, long-lived
GZMK+ effector memory cells of increased potency, and clonally
expanded, exhausted GZMB+ terminal effectors.
On average, patients showed signiﬁcantly higher normaliza-
tion scores at EOT compared with BL (Figure 4I). Using a
threshold of 0.1 based on the distribution of change in normaliza-
tion scores at EOT, we deﬁned a state of post-therapy immune
normalization (PIN) and classiﬁed four patients who showed no
or minimal increase in their normalization score at EOT as PIN
(Figures 4J and 4K). Patients who achieved PIN at EOT (PIN+)
had signiﬁcantly longer PFS (Figure 4L), suggesting that PIN
may be important for prognostication. Both patients who had
del17p of the 12 patients with matched BL and EOT BM samples
were classiﬁed as PIN, so the effect of PIN on PFS needs to be
deconvolved from that of del17p in larger cohorts.
Higher abundance of GZMK-expressing CD8+ T cells is
associated with longer PFS in patients with HRSMM
treated with EloLenDex
We have shown previously that patients with HRSMM have
decreased abundance of memory-like GZMK+ CD8+ TEM cells
in favor of more mature GZMB+ effectors and that lower levels
of memory T cells in vivo are associated with shorter OS (Zavidij
et al., 2020). Therefore, we hypothesized that higher levels of
GZMK+ CD8+ TEM cells in the BM may be associated with pro-
longed PFS in our patients. Consistent with our prior ﬁndings,
patients with HRSMM showed a signiﬁcant shift from GZMK+
to GZMB+ CD8+ TEM cells in the BM, with a signiﬁcant decrease
in the abundance of GZMK+ CD8+ TEM cells relative to all cyto-
toxic T cells at BL compared with HD (Figure 5A). However, the
average levels of GZMK expression in patient T cells increased
signiﬁcantly at EOT, reﬂecting a signiﬁcant increase in GZMK-
expressing cells, which was validated by CyTOF (Figures 5B
and S6A). In the PB, where we were powered to investigate
changes in T cell clonality at EOT, we found that GZMK+ CD8+
TEM cells from EOT samples were more likely to belong to
expanded clones (Figure 5C). These results suggest that this
subpopulation may play a role in response to immunotherapy.
Compared with GZMB+ CD8+ TEM cells in our cohort, GZMK+
CD8+ TEM cells showed higher expression of CXCR4 and lower
expression of S1P receptors, suggesting preferential retainment
of GZMK+ CD8+ TEM cells in the BM (Figure 5D). By comparing
the abundance of these cells between matched BM and PB pa-
tient samples, we observed enrichment of GZMK+ CD8+ TEM
cells in the BM (Figure 5E). This enrichment was also observed
in BM samples from HDs (data not shown), suggesting that this
may be a physiological bias. GZMK+ CD8+ TEM cells had higher
expression of the canonical exhaustion markers TOX, TIGIT,
TNFRSF9 (encoding 4-1BB), and TNFSF9 (encoding 4-1BBL)
as well as markers of long-lived memory effector cells, including
TCF7 (encoding Tcf-1), CD27, and CD28, a phenotype consis-
tent with progenitor exhausted T (TPEX) cells (Figure 5D). At the
protein level, GZMK+ CD8+ TEM cells were a major source of
PD-1 expression within cytotoxic T cells in patients (Figures 5F
and S6B), in accordance with the suspected TPEX phenotype.
TPEX cells maintain their proliferative capacity, can differentiate
into terminal effector cells, and are thought to mediate the clin-
ical beneﬁts observed in patients treated with immune check-
point inhibitors (Galletti et al., 2020). In our cohort, patients
with a higher abundance of GZMK+ CD8+ TEM cells had signiﬁ-
cantly longer PFS in response to EloLenDex (Figure 5G). Simi-
larly, patients with higher average GZMK expression across their
T cells had signiﬁcantly longer PFS (Figure S6C). No association

was observed between the abundance of GZMK+ CD8+ TEM
cells and age (Wilcoxon, p = 0.55), whereas age had no effect
on PFS (log rank, p = 0.7).
These results suggest that GZMK+ CD8+ TEM cells may be
important for disease control and response to therapy in patients
with SMM.
PB-based immune proﬁling accurately detects
alterations in immune cell composition and TCR
repertoire diversity observed in the BM
Next we set out to determine whether PB can be used reliably for
immune proﬁling of patients with HRSMM because BM biopsies
are invasive and carry risk, which precludes regular patient
testing. First, we compared the Jensen-Shannon divergence of
immune cell composition between matched and unmatched
PB and BM samples and observed signiﬁcantly lower diver-
gence in matched pairs, which was also low overall, suggesting
that matched PB samples reﬂect BM composition well (Fig-
ure 6A). In principal-component analysis (PCA) space, where
principal component 1 (PC1) captured the compositional
changes observed in patient BM (Figure 6B), HD PB and BM
samples clustered together on the right end of the axis, whereas
patient PB and BM samples clustered together on the opposite
side of PC1 (Figure 6C). This observation suggests that the
compositional differences between patient and HD PB are
similar to those observed in patient BM compared with HD
BM. When we compared PB samples between patients and
HD, we recovered compositional changes originally discovered
in our BM-based analysis (Figure 6D). However, patient PB
showed a signiﬁcantly lower abundance of CD16+ monocytes,
which are enriched in patient BM. Contrary to HDs, where
CD16+ monocytes are signiﬁcantly enriched in the PB compared
with the BM, in patients there was no signiﬁcant difference be-
tween the PB and the BM, suggesting that these cells may be
homing to the patient BM (Figure S7). Last, consistent with
what we observed in patient BM, the patient PB TCR repertoire
showed signiﬁcantly lower diversity compared with HDs,
suggesting that the observed effect on diversity may not be
constrained to the tumor microenvironment (Figure 6E). These
results suggest that certain immune biomarkers may be measur-
able in the PB. Consistent with what we saw in the BM, higher BL
levels of signature GEX-13 in patient PB were associated with
signiﬁcantly shorter PFS (Figure 6F). Neither signature GEX-6
nor immune reactivity were prognostic in PB, suggesting that
PB-based immune proﬁling may not be able to entirely replace
BM-based proﬁling.
Last, given the concordance of compositional changes be-
tween patient BM and PB, we tested whether immune proﬁling
of PB samples alone could enable the diagnosis of an individual
with HRSMM. Remarkably, a classiﬁer we trained on BM compo-
sition data (this time excluding progenitor cells, which are pri-
marily encountered in the BM) to infer the presence of SMM
was able to correctly classify nearly all of our patient and HD
PB samples with an accuracy of 97% (Figure 6G). Our ﬁndings
demonstrate that PB-based immune proﬁling accurately detects
compositional changes observed in the BM and may hold diag-
nostic and prognostic potential.
DISCUSSION
Although early treatment has been shown to delay progression in
patients with HRSMM, identifying those who will beneﬁt the
most remains an unmet clinical need (Mateos and San Miguel,
2015; Kim et al., 2020). Despite the availability of clinical and
genomic biomarkers of progression (Kyle et al., 2007; Mateos
et al., 2020; Pe´rez-Persona et al., 2007; Bustoros et al., 2020; Mis-
und et al., 2020; Boyle et al., 2021; Bolli et al., 2018; Oben et al.,
2021), little is known about the role of BM immune dysregulation
indiseaseprogressionandresponsetotreatmentorthediagnostic
and prognostic utility of PB-based immune proﬁling. Here we con-
ducted a phase II trial to determine the utility and safety of early
treatment with EloLenDex in patients with HRSMM and performed
correlative DNA sequencing and single-cell RNA and TCR
sequencing studies to develop genomic and immune biomarkers
for optimal patient selection and monitoring of response to treat-
ment. The overall response rate was 87%, PFS was 88.7% at
48 months (90% CI, 81.2%–96.9%), and OS was 95.6% at
48 months (90% CI, 90.6%–100%). Although this trial did not
have an observation arm, this progression rate (13% at 4 years)
is substantially lower than that determined for patients with

within 5 years from diagnosis (Rajkumar et al., 2015; Kyle et al.,
2007; Mateos et al., 2020). This was also true for patients in our trial
who had HR by the 20-2-20 criteria and who showed a 20%
progression rate within 4 years of follow-up. Treatment was well
tolerated with minimal toxicity of grade 3 or higher, including hypo-
phosphatemia and cytopenias, which were expected. Because
this was a single-arm study, we cannot comment on how the
response rate and PFS of EloLenDex compare with those of
LenDex alone, and future clinical trials randomizing these 2 regi-
mens would be required to answer this. Overall, EloLenDex was
deemed safe and effective, with no evidence of aggressive sub-
clone selection after treatment in two patients who progressed.
In fact, in those patients, we observed a regression of subclones
harboring amp1q or del1p and a TP53 SNV. Although preliminary,
these results suggest that, in some instances, early treatment
could alter the clonal dynamics in patients who progress, which
could potentiallyresultinimprovedOSinthelongterm.Theseﬁnd-
ings would need to be validated in larger trials with more available
samples before and after therapy. Aggressive tumor biology, as
determined by the presence of del17p, was a signiﬁcant predictor
of shorter PFS in patients treated with EloLenDex in our cohort.
Therefore, patients with HRSMM and del17p may perhaps need
different regimens or longer duration of therapy.
Patients with HRSMM showed increased abundance of naive
and memory CD4+ T cells, GZMB+ CD8+ TEM cells, and CD56dim
NK cells and decreased abundance of CD14+ monocytes and
pDCs compared with HDs. Their TCR repertoire diversity was
signiﬁcantly lower compared with HDs because of broad low-level
clonal expansion, which was mostly observed in GZMB+ CD8+
TEM cells and Treg cells. More studies are required to determine
the functionality and antigen speciﬁcity of these immune cell
populations and their role in controlling or promoting disease
progression.
We found that the similarity of a patient’s BM immune microen-
vironment to that of HDs may be useful for prognostication. At BL,
patients with the least normal-like immune cell composition,
presumed to be reactive to the tumor, had signiﬁcantly longer
PFS under treatment with EloLenDex. Reactive patients had lower
proportions of pro-inﬂammatory myeloid cells and pDCs, long-
lived GZMK+ CD8+ TEM cells of increased potency, and clonally
expanded,exhausted GZMB+CD8+ TEMcells.GZMK-expressing
cells, which are normally enriched in the BM, had a phenotype
compatible withprogenitorexhausted cells and clonallyexpanded
after treatment, suggesting that they may play a role in response to
therapy. Patients with a higher abundance of GZMK+ CD8+ TEM
cells in their BM showed signiﬁcantly longer PFS. Patients whose
BM normalization scores increased after therapy (PIN) had signif-
icantly longer PFS. This ﬁnding suggests that immune proﬁling
may be useful to monitor response to treatment, although valida-
tion in larger cohorts and with different regimens is required.
Last, immune proﬁling currently requires a BM biopsy, which
precludes its regular use for prognostication. By comparing PB
from patients and HDs, we identiﬁed nearly the same alterations
in immune cell composition and TCR repertoire diversity as those
seen in our BM-based comparisons. A classiﬁer trained to detect
the presence of SMM based on BM immune proﬁling was able to
correctly classify nearly all PB samples from patients with SMM
and HDs. Our results suggest that PB-based immune proﬁling
may have diagnostic and prognostic utility, although it may not
be able to entirely replace BM-based proﬁling.
Our results demonstrate the utility and safety of EloLenDex in
patients with HRSMM, provide a comprehensive characteriza-
tion of alterations in immune cell composition and TCR repertoire
diversity in patient BM and PB, nominate immune biomarkers for
optimal patient selection and assessment of response to treat-
ment, and demonstrate that PB-based immune proﬁling may
have diagnostic and prognostic utility in patients with SMM.

(A) Boxplots, violin plots, and scatterplots showing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between matched BM and PB samples (n = 22) compared with unmatched
samples. Violin outline width represents density. The p value was computed using Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test (box: ﬁrst quartile, median, third quartile;
whiskers: ±1.5 3 IQR).
(B) Heatmap of Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (r) between BM immune cell abundance and the ﬁrst 10 PCs. The x axis was sorted by decreasing PC1 value. The
top panel shows the log2 fold change in abundance between BM samples from patients with HRSMM (n = 32) and those from HDs (n = 19). p values were
corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg approach, and stars correspond to pairs with signiﬁcant (q < 0.05) correlation.
(C) Two-dimensional density plot of BM and PB samples from patients (BM, n = 26; PB, n = 29) or HDs (BM, n = 22; PB, 10) according to PC1 and PC2.
(D) Volcano plot of proportion changes in the PB of patients with HRSMM (n = 19) compared with HDs (NPB, n = 10) with at least 100 cells overall. p values were
computed with Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test and corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg approach. Cell types with q < 0.2 are marked with stars.
(E) Boxplots, violin plots, and scatterplots comparing PB TCR repertoire diversity, as assessed by the Chao index, between patients with HRSMM (n = 22) and
healthy individuals (NPB, n = 10) given different numbers of downsampled cells. Each data point represents the average diversity estimate across 100 random
samples of the given size for a single sample; the range of diversity estimates across all iterations for each sample is visualized in error bars (dotted line). Violin
outline width represents density. p values were computed with Wilcoxon’s rank-sum tests (box: ﬁrst quartile, median, third quartile; whiskers: ±1.5 3 IQR).
(F) Forest plot showing the effect of mean BL GEX-13 activity in the PB on PFS. Hazard ratio, 95% CI, and p value were computed using Cox proportional hazards
regression.
(G) Confusion matrix visualizing the accuracy of a naive Bayes classiﬁer trained on BM samples from patients and HDs (training set, n = 41) and tested in PB
samples (n = 29).

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Clinical trial and patients
Study design
The primary objective of this trial was to determine the proportion of patients with high-risk SMM (HRSMM) who were progression-
free at 2 years post-treatment. Secondary objectives included safety and toxicity, time to progression, overall response rate, duration
of response, and overall survival.
From January 2015 to November 2016, patients were enrolled at Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts; Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts; Carolina HC Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, North Carolina; Colorado Blood
Cancer Institute, Denver, Colorado; Eastern Maine Medical Center, Bangor, Maine; Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan;
Marlene and Stewart Greenbaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, Maryland; Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts;
Newton-Wellesley Hospital, Newton, Massachusetts; St. Francis Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut; and University of Chicago, Chi-
cago, Illinois.
Patients were eligible for this trial if they were 18 years of age or older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status of 0 to 2, and were classiﬁed as HRSMM. HRSMM was deﬁned according to Rajkumar et al. as the presence of BM clonal
plasma cells R10% (but less than 60%) and at least one of the following: serum M protein R3.0 mg/dL; IgA SMM; immunoparesis
with reduction of two uninvolved immunoglobulin isotypes; serum involved/uninvolved free light chain ration R8 (but less than 100);
evolving type of SMM, i.e., progressive increase in M protein level; BM clonal plasma cells 50–60%; abnormal cell immunophenotype
(R95% of BM plasma cells are clonal) and reduction of one or more uninvolved immunoglobulin isotypes; t(4;14) or del17p or amp1q;
increased circulating plasma cells; MRI with diffuse abnormalities or 1 focal lesion (R5 mm); PET-CT with one focal lesion (R5 mm)
with increased uptake without underlying osteolytic bone destruction (Rajkumar et al., 2015). Furthermore, patients had to show no
evidence of myeloma-deﬁning events as described by the IMWG (Rajkumar et al., 2014), and the following laboratory values had to
be shown within 28 days prior to registration: Absolute Neutrophil Count R1000/mm3, Platelets (PLT) R 50,000/mm3, Total Bilirubin
<2.0 mg/dL, Aspartate and Alanine Aminotransferase (AST/ALT) % 3 3 ULN, and an estimated creatinine clearance >50 mL/min/
1.73m2. Patients with other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investiga-
tional, serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation, a diagnosis or treatment for another malignancy
within 2 years of enrollment were excluded.
All patients provided informed consent. The review boards of all participating centers approved the study in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference of Harmonization Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. This study was regis-
tered as a phase II study with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02279394.
Study treatment
This phase II trial used a single-stage design to assess the efﬁcacy of the combination of Elotuzumab and Lenalidomide with or
without Dexamethasone in patients with HRSMM. Patients were randomized 1:1 to Arm A (EloLenDex) or Arm B (EloLen), based
on the stratiﬁcation factors described below.
In the treatment schema a cycle is deﬁned as 28 consecutive days. In cycles 1 and 2, 10 mg/kg of intravenous push Elotuzumab
was administered on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. In cycles 3–4, it was administered on days 1 and 15. A 25 mg dose of oral Lenalidomide
was administered on days 1–21 of each cycle. In Arm A, 40 mg of oral Dexamethasone was administered on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in
cycles 1 and 2 and on days 1, 8, and 15 in cycles 3–8. Patients on maintenance treatment (cycles 9–24) were administered 20 mg/kg
of intravenous push Elotuzumab on day 1 and 15 mg oral Lenalidomide on days 1–21. All patients received thromboprophylaxis.
In consideration of the Mateos et al. study, investigators were given the option to allow high-dose Dexamethasone to be resumed
during maintenance due to biochemical progression (progressive increase in serum M-spike by at least 25% with an absolute in-
crease of at least 0.5 g/dL or urine M-spike by at least 25% with an absolute increase of at least 200 mg/24 hours, on two successive
evaluations, as determined by the IMWG response criteria or documented progression by serum free light chain criteria in the
absence of serum or urine involvement; Mateos et al., 2013). A total of 5 patients were given Dexamethasone during maintenance.
The dosing schedule for this followed that of cycles 3–8, with 8 mg intravenous push and 32 mg oral Dexamethasone on days 1 and 15
and 40 mg oral Dexamethasone on day 8.
Stratiﬁcation factors
Originally, the study aimed to secondarily determine whether Dexamethasone is beneﬁcial or detrimental in this immunotherapy
regimen for SMM. Therefore, the study was designed with two arms, meant to serve as two independent phase II studies to determine
the activity of EloLen with or without Dexamethasone in the patient population. Patients were stratiﬁed by age (R65 vs <65) and high-
risk cytogenetics [t(4;14), t(14;16), del17p, TP53 mutation, amp1q] (high-risk, low-risk, FISH failure) before being randomly assigned
to one of the two arms.
Arm B accrual
Arm B accrual was halted in April 2016 for two reasons: 1) treatment with Elotuzumab required premedication with high doses of
steroids to avoid infusion reactions and the difference in Dexamethasone dosing between the two arms (approximately 4 mg Dexa-
methasone per dosing day) for the ﬁrst 2 cycles was not signiﬁcant, and 2) a publication by Paiva et al. (2016). demonstrated that once
weekly high-dose Dexamethasone does not have a detrimental effect on the immune system in patients with SMM in a clinical trial of
Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone. The patients who were originally enrolled in Arm B remained in Arm B until the completion of
therapy.

Cohort details
In total, 51 patients enrolled and received at least one dose of treatment. Three patients were deemed ineligible soon after they
received treatment, due to misdiagnosis (overt myeloma with lesions on PET-CT, amyloidosis, and light chain deposition disease),
and were excluded from further analysis. Two patients received less than 2 full cycles of treatment and were excluded from our overall
response assessment and correlative studies but were included for toxicity assessment. Out of the 46 patients remaining in the
cohort, 29 were female and 17 were male, while the median age at registration was 62 (range: 29–77).
Imaging
To assess the extent of disease involvement, imaging studies were performed at both BL and EOT. All patients had either an MRI with
a skeletal survey or a PET/CT scan.
Efﬁcacy and safety assessments
Toxicities were monitored throughout the study and for up to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. Adverse events (AEs) were
graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 4.0; Bethesda,
MD). In addition, neuropathy symptoms were assessed using the FACT/GOG- Neuropathy questionnaire (Version 4.0). Efﬁcacy was
measured using the IWMG criteria for response.
Treatment discontinuation and patient disposition
The median duration of treatment was 24 cycles (range = 1–24). In total, 40 of 51 patients received all 24 cycles. Of those, 30 (75%)
were in arm A and 10 (25%) in arm B. Of the 10 patients in Arm A who did not complete all 24 cycles, 3 patients discontinued therapy
during the induction cycles due to an incorrect initial diagnosis (one participant had myeloma lytic lesions on a PET scan that was
originally misread at an outside institution and re-checked at DFCI afterward; another participant had amyloidosis that was missed
at the time of enrollment but was discovered after 3 cycles of therapy—the patient achieved VGPR on therapy before being removed
from the protocol and placed on active amyloidosis therapy with a proteasome inhibitor-based approach; one ﬁnal patient had light
chain deposition disease, which was identiﬁed on a kidney biopsy after one cycle of therapy—the patient was then removed from the
protocol to start active therapy). Six other patients discontinued therapy due to toxicity and withdrawal of consent or physician de-
cision. Patient disposition is visualized in Figure S1B.
Overall, two deaths occurred. One patient had Type I Diabetes and was hospitalized for Diabetic ketoacidosis (cycle 19). This was
at a time when the patient was not receiving Dexamethasone. The patient developed diverticulitis, bowel perforation, and sepsis and
died due to sepsis. The second patient was on the last cycle of therapy when they experienced uncontrolled hypertension due to non-
compliance with their hypertension medications. They then developed heart failure and died of hypertensive crisis.
METHOD DETAILS
Sample processing
Bone marrow (BM) aspirate and peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected in EDTA tubes, and mononuclear cells (BMMCs &
PBMCs) were isolated using Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer (ThermoFisher). Tumor and immune cells were then isolated by magnetic
enrichment for CD138 (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and cryopreserved in FBS with 10% DMSO.
Whole-exome and deep targeted sequencing
We performed WES on baseline BM aspirate specimens from 37 study participants. Tumor DNA was extracted from CD138+ cells
from the patients’ BM. For germline control, DNA was obtained from PBMCs. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA
mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocols, and the DNA concentration was quantiﬁed using PicoGreen dsDNA
Assay kit (Life Technologies). WES libraries were prepared by Agilent SureSelect XT2 Target Enrichment kit (V5+UTR probes). For
three individuals, libraries for deep targeted sequencing (DTS) were prepared using SureSelect XT Reagent Kits (Agilent) and an
in-house bait set targeting 117 genes, comprising pan-cancer driver genes and frequently mutated genes in MM (Bustoros et al.,
2020). Lastly, for two out of four patients who progressed to overt myeloma, tumor samples were available at the time of progression
and were also studied by WES (Roche MedExome+) to characterize the landscape of clonal evolution under treatment. All
sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform at the Genomics Platform of the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard.
Six WES samples were excluded from analysis due to low tumor purity (<15%). Our ﬁnal baseline cohort comprised 31 WES samples
and 3 DTS samples.
Single-cell RNA sequencing
We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 149 CD138- BMMC and PBMC samples from 34 patients enrolled in the E-PRISM trial.
Speciﬁcally, we sequenced 60 CD138- BMMC samples at BL (n = 28), C9D1 (n = 16), and EOT (n = 16), 68 PBMC samples at BL (n =
33), C9D1 (n = 13), C4D1 (n = 1), and EOT (n = 21)], 11 CD138- BMMC samples from age-matched HD, and 10 PBMC samples from
age-matched HD. For 23 patients, BL BM and PB samples were matched; for 8 patients, C9D1 BM and PB samples were matched;
for 13 patients EOT BM and PB samples were matched (Figure S8A). Of note, in contrast to our patient samples, HD BM and PB
samples were from different individuals.
For library preparation, we used Chromium Single Cell 30 Gene Expression (n = 40) and Chromium Single Cell 50 Gene Expression
kits (n = 109) by 10X Genomics. Speciﬁcally, we performed 30 single-cell RNA sequencing on 40 CD138- BMMC samples drawn at BL
(n = 11), C9D1 (n = 13) or EOT (n = 9), and PBMC samples drawn at BL(n = 4) and C9D1 (n = 3). We performed 50 single-cell RNA

sequencing on 98 CD138- BMMC samples drawn at BL (n = 17), C9D1 (n = 3) or EOT (n = 7), and PBMC samples drawn at BL (n = 29),
C4D1 (n = 1), C9D1 (n = 10) or EOT (n = 21). We also performed 50 single-cell RNA sequencing on 11 CD138- BMMC samples and 10
PBMC samples from HD. All 30 libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 instrument and all 50 libraries were sequenced on a
NovaSeq 6000 instrument at the Genomics Platform of the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard.
Reproducibility of cell type abundance quantiﬁcation via single-cell RNA sequencing
To assess the reproducibility of our cell type quantiﬁcation, we thawed two cell vials for each of 9 samples; for ﬁve of them, both
replicate libraries were prepared using the same technology (30- or 50-end sequencing) (technical replicates); for four of them,
each replicate library was prepared with a different technology (technology replicates).
Single-cell TCR sequencing
We performed single-cell TCR sequencing on 91 samples with available single-cell RNA sequencing data (Figure S8A). Speciﬁcally,
we proﬁled 70 BM and PB patient samples drawn before and after therapy [BM: 14 at BL, 3 at C9D1, 2 at EOT; PB: 26 at BL, 8 at
C9D1, 17 at EOT], and 21 samples from HD [BM:11; PB:10]. Complementary DNA generated from barcoded CD138- immune cells
using Chromium Single Cell 50 Gene Expression and V(D)J enrichment kits by 10X Genomics was subjected to V(D)J enrichment and
library preparation and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 instrument at the Genomics Platform of the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard.
Cytometry by time-of-ﬂight (CyTOF)
Metal-tagged antibodies used for the mass cytometry panel are listed in the Key Resources table. In-house conjugation of Granzyme
K antibody was performed with Maxpar labeling kit per manufacturer instructions (Fluidigm). All antibodies were used per the man-
ufacturer’s recommendation (Fluidigm).
Cryopreserved patient CD138- BM Mononuclear Cell (BMMC) samples were thawed, counted using AO/PI, and pelleted by centri-
fugation at 400g for 10 minutes. Cells were then incubated in 103Rh viability stain for 15 minutes, washed in CyFACS, and incubated
with undiluted Human TruStain FcX for 10 min for Fc receptor blocking. Antibody master mix was applied to the cell suspension
for 30 minutes, washed, and ﬁxed/permeabilized with FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Concentrate and Diluent following manufac-
turer’s guidelines (eBioscience). A mix of intracellular antibodies prepared with 1X Perm Wash was added to each sample and
incubated for 30 minutes. Next, cells were washed with 1X Perm Wash, and incubated overnight at 4C in FoxP3 Fixation/Permea-
bilization Concentrate and Diluent, containing 191/193Ir DNA Intercalator. Prior to acquisition, samples were transferred to 5 mL
round-bottom polystyrene tubes with cell strainer caps, washed and ﬁltered with Cell Staining Buffer (CSB), Cell Acquisition Solution
(CAS), and resuspended in CAS supplemented with EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (1:10).
All mass cytometry data was collected on a HeliosTM Mass Cytometer (Fluidigm). The instrument was tuned using CyTOF Tuning
Solution according to the Helios User Guide (Fluidigm, p. 60–68). A brief overview of tuning steps includes Pre-XY Optimization, Mass
Calibration, XY Optimization, DV Calibration, Dual Calibration, Gases/Current Calibration, and QC report. EQ Four Element Calibra-
tion Beads (1:10 in CAS) were used according to the manufacturer protocol before and during acquisition.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Clinical trial statistical analysis & biomarker discovery
Patient baseline characteristics were summarized as the number of patients or median values. Responses to study treatment were
reported as proportions with 90% exact binomial conﬁdence intervals.
We assessed the proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 2 years, compared to the previously published rate for
HRSMM—a median time to progression of only 1.9 years according to the Kyle et al. model (Kyle et al., 2007). Therefore, we decided
that for this study, a 2-year progression-free survival rate of 50% would not be considered promising; instead, a progression-free
survival rate of 70% or higher would be a promising result.
This phase II study used a single-stage binomial design. With a sample size of 39 patients, the probability of concluding that the
treatment is effective if the true rate is 50% was 0.10 and was >0.9 if the true rate is 70%. Assuming an ineligibility rate of 5%, we
aimed to accrue 41 patients per Arm to the trial. Time to response (TTR) was measured from treatment initiation to the date the
response was ﬁrst observed. Duration of response was measured from response to progressive disease (PD) or death, censored
at the date of last disease assessment for those who did not progress. Time-to-progression (TTP), and progression-free survival
(PFS) were measured from the time of treatment initiation to event (PD for TTP; PD or death for PFS). Patients without event were
censored at the date of last disease assessment for both TTP and PFS. If non-protocol therapy, excluding erythropoietin, was added
prior to an event, patients were censored in the time-to-event analyses at the initiation of non-protocol therapy. Six total patients had
progression-free survival events deﬁned as progressive disease to myeloma-deﬁning events (n = 4) or death (n = 2). Another four
patients (n = 4) were treated based on worsening biomarkers and the physician’s decision and were considered progressors for
our correlative studies only. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time to event and the log-rank test was used to compare
time to event. Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to assess the signiﬁcance of variable associations with outcome.
Continuous variables, such as cell type proportions, were tested as such and were dichotomized based on the median for Kaplan-
Meier curves. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.1.3. All results with p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to correct for multiple hypothesis testing, when appropriate. Our data cut-off
was November 7, 2020.

ECOG randomized trial of Lenalidomide versus observation in patients with HRSMM
Due to the unavailability of patient-level information, survival data were recapitulated from published Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots in Lo-
nial et al. (2020). The curves and at-risk tables were extracted as raster images, and their x and y coordinates were digitized using the
commercial software DigitizeIt (https://www.digitizeit.xyz/). Using the algorithm proposed by Guyot et al., the coordinates and num-
ber of patients at-risk during each time interval were used to estimate censored, time-to-event data (Guyot et al., 2012). With the pa-
tient-level data, we were able to re-generate the survival curves, at-risk tables, log-rank tests, etc. In particular, we used the KM
method to explore the effect of the 20-2-20 risk stratiﬁcation system on PFS in the Lenalidomide arm of the ECOG trial and the
log-rank test to compute the p-value.
WES analysis
The output from Illumina software was processed by the Picard data processing pipeline to yield BAM ﬁles containing well-calibrated,
aligned reads. We utilized the Getz Lab CGA WES Characterization pipeline developed at the Broad Institute to call, ﬁlter, and anno-
tate somatic mutations and copy number variation. The pipeline employs the following tools: MuTect, ContEst, Strelka, Orientation
Bias Filter, DeTiN, AllelicCapSeg, MAFPoNFilter, RealignmentFilter, ABSOLUTE, GATK, PicardTools, Variant Effect Predictor, Onco-
tator (Cibulskis et al., 2011, 2013; Saunders et al., 2012; Costello et al., 2013; Taylor-Weiner et al., 2018; Landau et al., 2013; Law-
rence et al., 2014; Carter et al., 2012; McKenna et al., 2010; McLaren et al., 2016; Ramos et al., 2015). SNVs and CNVs were further
cleaned with a custom PoN made of matched normal samples (Lawrence et al., 2014), and a bait bias ﬁlter was developed to correct
for observed artifacts in the SNV data, as described before (Bustoros et al., 2020). ABSOLUTE was applied to estimate sample purity,
ploidy, and absolute somatic copy numbers, which were used to infer the CCFs of point mutations and CNVs from the WES data,
following the framework previously described (Carter et al., 2012).
Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis
Analysis workﬂow
CellRanger v.5.0.1. was used for FASTQ ﬁle extraction and generation of count matrices (Zheng et al., 2017). We integrated E-PRISM
data with our cohort of non-trial patients with MGUS (n = 6), low-risk SMM (LRSMM, n = 3), HRSMM (HRSMM, n = 12), newly diag-
nosed MM (NDMM, n = 9) and HD (n = 11) (Zavidij et al., 2020). Non-trial patients with SMM were risk-stratiﬁed based on the original
Mayo Clinic criteria (Kyle et al., 2007), and NDMM was diagnosed based on the CRAB criteria.
We performed ambient RNA correction with SoupX; doublet detection with Scrublet, scDblFinder, and SCDS; normalization with
Scran; and integration with Harmony (correcting for sample ID and technology) (Young and Behjati, 2020; Wolock et al., 2019; Ger-
main et al., 2021; Bais and Kostka, 2019; Lun et al., 2016; Korsunsky et al., 2019). Samples prepared with 30-end or 50-end technology
mixed well in PCA, demonstrating successful integration across technologies (Figure S8B). Droplets were deemed to be doublets
when at least 2 out of four methods classiﬁed them as such and they were only removed from consideration when they clustered
together and co-expressed markers of multiple cell types. Droplets containing dying cells with more than 15% mitochondrial
gene expression were removed before clustering. Clusters with higher mitochondrial and ribosomal gene expression that clearly
separated from well-annotated clusters and lacked interpretable expression markers were removed downstream. In total, we proﬁled
211,374 immune cells (1,419 cells/sample), comprising T cells, NK cells, B cells, Monocytes, Dendritic cells, and progenitor pop-
ulations. For each cell population (T cells, NK cells, B cells, Monocytes, Dendritic cells, progenitor cells), feature selection, dimen-
sionality reduction, and clustering were also performed separately, to identify cell subpopulations (see below for annotation strategy).
Cell type/subtype proportions were calculated as the fraction of cells belonging to said type/subtype out of all immune cells unless
otherwise speciﬁed. For comparisons of cell type proportions, samples with fewer than 100 cells were removed from consideration.
Proportion changes were assessed with Wilcoxon’s rank-sum tests or paired t-tests when comparing serial timepoints within the
same patients or matched BM and PB samples. When multiple hypotheses were tested, p-values were corrected using the
Benjamini-Hochberg approach. For survival analysis, cell type abundance was discretized based on the median.
Differential expression was performed using Wilcoxon’s rank-sum tests at the single-cell level and DESeq2 at the pseudobulk level
(Love et al., 2014). Genes with more than 3 counts in at least 10 cells were considered for differential expression. For pseudobulk
analyses, genes with more than 10 counts in at least 25% of samples were considered for differential expression. p-values were cor-
rected for multiple hypotheses testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg approach.
Cell type and subtype annotation
Gene expression markers used for cell type and subtype annotation can be found in Figure 2. Scran-normalized expression values
were Z-scored and the mean Z-score per cluster was used to plot the heatmaps.
Within the T cell compartment, we identiﬁed naı¨ve CD8+ (CD8+ TN) and CD4+ T cells (CD4+ TN) (LEF1, TCF7, SELL, CCR7), central
memory CD8+ (CD8+ TCM) and CD4+ T cells (CD4+ TCM) (FAS, IL7R, HNRNPLL), helper type 1 T cells (Th1) (CD4, CXCR3, GZMA,
GZMK, LYAR, CCL5), helper type 2 T cells (Th2) (CD4, GATA3, KRT1, CCR4), helper type 17 T cells (Th17) (CD4, RORA, KLRB1,
CCR6, TNFRSF4), regulatory T cells (Treg) (CD4, IL2RA, FOXP3, CTLA4, RTKN2, IKZF2), mucosa-associated invariant T cells

genes of the AP-1 module and general activation markers (aCD4+ TN & aCD4+ TCM) (JUN, FOS, FOSB, CD69, DUSP1, TSC22D3).
Lastly, we identiﬁed a second CD4+ regulatory subpopulation, clustering adjacent to Tregs and expressing high levels of CTLA4 and
MHC-II-encoding genes, a proﬁle most consistent with effector Tregs, which we annotated as eTregs.
Within the NK cell compartment, we identiﬁed CD56bright NK cells (CD56br NK) (NCAM1), CD2, XCL2, KLRC1, IL7R, SELL, GZMK),

(CXCL12, LEPR, KITLG, VCAM1, COL1A1, COL1A2, CCL2).
Gene expression signature discovery & annotation
A Bayesian version of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) was performed using SignatureAnalyzer on the count matrix of the top
5,000 highly variable genes for gene expression signature discovery (Kasar et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016). Half-normal priors were
imposed for both the W (gene by signature) and the H matrix (cell by signature), as we reasoned that a single gene could contribute
towards multiple expression programs and a single cell could be described by multiple expression programs. The tool was run 30
times and the run that resulted in a K (i.e., number of signatures) equal to the mode of the K distribution and had the lowest objective
was selected for downstream analysis (Figure S5B). Gene expression signature markers were nominated by (i) multiplying the W ma-
trix by the sum of signature activity across all cells in the H matrix, (ii) calculating the fraction of each signature’s activity for each gene
(matrix F) and (iii) ranking genes based on the product of W (i.e., how strongly each gene contributes to the signature) and F (i.e., how
strongly each signature contributes to the gene). A total of 26 gene expression (GEX) signatures were extracted (Figure S5C): GEX-1
corresponded to cytokine signaling associated with GZMK-expressing subpopulations (XCL1, XCL2, CCL3, CCL4); GEX-2 captured
naı¨ve T cells (TCF7, LEF1, TXNIP, IL7R, LTB, NOSIP); GEX-3 captured dendritic cells (CLEC10A, FCER1A, CD74, HLA-DRA, HLA-
DRB1); GEX-4 captured B cells (CD19, MS4A1, IGHM, IGHD, CD79A, CD79B); GEX-5 was associated with ferritin heavy and light
chain expression (FTH1, FTL) and was primarily active in myeloid cells; GEX-6 corresponded to pro-inﬂammatory signaling (IL1B,

(MX1, STAT1, XAF1, IFI6, IFI44L, ISG15) and was active in T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes; GEX-8 was associated with
thymosin expression and the alpha and beta chains of the TCR (TMSB4X, TMSB10, TRAC, TRBC1), and was primarily active in
T cells; GEX-9 was associated with histone 1 gene expression (HIST1H1C, HIST1H1D, HIST1H1E) and was primarily active in den-
dritic cells; GEX-10 was associated with metabolic programming (GLUL, SLC43A2, SLC25A37) and hypoxia-related signaling
(HIF1A, TIMP1, NEAT1), and was primarily active in myeloid cells; GEX-11 corresponded to CD14+ monocytes (CD14, MS4A6A,
FCN1, LYZ); GEX-12 corresponded to immature B cells (ACSM3, IGLL1, VPREB1, TCL1A, MME, SOX4); GEX-13 corresponded
to pDCs (LILRA4, JCHAIN, SERPINF1, PTGDS, ITM2C, IRF4, IRF8); GEX-14 corresponded to a different program within classical
monocytes (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, VCAN); GEX-15 corresponded to Th17 cells and MAITs (RORA, KLRB1, CCR6); GEX-16
was associated with interferon type-I signaling (IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, PMAIP1, OASL, TNF, HERC5, ZC3HAV1); GEX-17 was associated
with T cell surface antigens (CD5, CD6, CD7); GEX-18 and GEX-19 were associated with genes of the AP-1 module (JUN, FOS, FOSB)
and general activation markers (DUSP1, TSC22D3, NFKBIA); GEX-20 corresponded to CD16+ monocytes (FCGR3A, CDKN1C, SER-
PINA1, MS4A7); GEX-21 corresponded to cytotoxic T cells (GZMK, GZMH, NKG7, CD8A, CD8B); GEX-22 corresponded to GZMB+
cytotoxic T cells and NK cells (GZMB, GNLY, SPON2, CLIC3, FGFBP2); GEX-23 was associated with genes frequently expressed by
myeloid cells (AHNAK, TLR2, CYBB) and was primarily active in monocytes; GEX-24 was associated with memory CD4+ T cell
expression markers (GATA3, CD28, PRDM1, ITGB1, ANXA1) and was primarily active in those populations; GEX-25 and GEX-26
were associated with cytoskeleton-related genes (ACTB, ACTG1, PFN1, CFL) and were primarily active in myeloid cells.
For survival analysis, each sample was assigned its mean signature activity across cells, and mean activity was discretized based
on the median.
Naı¨ve Bayes classiﬁer and normalization scores
We trained a Naı¨ve Bayes classiﬁer using the R package caret on a training set (n = 41) comprising BM samples from patients with
HRSMM and HD, using 10-fold cross-validation and 100 iterations, following a parameter sweep (Kuhn, 2008). The input to the clas-
siﬁer was the composition matrix of cell type proportions and included data on 63 subpopulations. The accuracy in the testing set (n =
16) was 94% (95% CI: 69.8%–99.8%, p = 0.0057) (Figure S5A). For each cell type, we compute its importance to the classiﬁcation
using the varImp() function, which employs an ROC approach, and signed it based on whether the cell type had a higher mean abun-
dance in disease (minus) or HD (plus). We then computed the weighted sum of the product of each cell type’s proportion and its
signed importance (normalization score), and classiﬁed patients as reactive (least normal-like) or non-reactive (most normal-like),
based on the median normalization score of patients at BL.
Single-cell TCR sequencing analysis
CellRanger v5.0.1 was used to extract FASTQ ﬁles and produce clonotype matrices (Zheng et al., 2017). When multiple alignments
were called for a single chain, the alignment with the most UMIs was selected, and when multiple chains were called for a single cell
barcode, the top two chains in terms of UMI counts were selected.
To control for variability in T cell numbers across samples, we downsampled a range of T cell numbers (n = 75–500) from each
sample with 100 iterations and averaged repertoire diversity estimates across iterations. Repertoire diversity was assessed using
the Chao index, as implemented in the vegan R package. To estimate the proportion of clonotypes belonging to a given clone
size (Rare: %1%; Small: >1% and <5%; Medium: R5% and <10%; Large: R10%) in a given sample, we downsampled 100
T cells from each sample with 100 iterations, converted clonotype counts into frequencies, computed the frequency of each clone
size, and subsequently averaged the frequency of each clone size across iterations and renormalized those frequencies for plotting.
To estimate the probability of a given T cell subtype to be clonally expanded in patients or HD, we ﬁrst computed stable clone sizes for
each clonotype in each sample, by downsampling 100 T cells with 100 iterations, converting clonotype counts into frequencies,
computing each clonotype’s clone size, and subsequently assigning each clonotype the mode of its clone size distribution across
all iterations. Next, for each T cell subtype, we randomly sampled 100 cells across all patients (or HD), and for each iteration, we
computed the frequency of rare (proportion of singletons) and expanded (1-rare) clonotypes. For visualization purposes, the average
frequencies were renormalized and plotted. p-values were computed by bootstrapping with 10,000 iterations.
CyTOF analysis
The data was normalized using the FCS Processing tab of the Fluidigm CyTOF Software 7.0.8493. Data analysis was manually per-
formed using FlowJo 10.7.1. For initial data clean-up, cell events were gated to remove dead cells and debris through biaxial plots of
Time vs. Event Length, Beads (for removal of the EQ Calibration Beads), and Gaussian-derived parameters (Residual, Width, Offset).
The viability stain 103Rh was used to gate out dead cells on PBMC populations. All viable cells were backgated on both DNA pa-
rameters (191Ir and 193Ir) to ensure no doublets were included. Please refer to Hallisey et al. for the detailed protocol (Hallisey
et al., 2022).

Figure S5. Immune cell classifier and gene expression signature analysis, related to 
Figure 4. (A) Confusion matrix visualizing the performance of the disease classifier on a 
testing set of BM samples from patients and HD (n=16). (B) Scatterplot of the number of 
signatures extracted (K, x-axis) and the corresponding value of the objective function (y-
axis) for each of the NMF runs (n=30). On the top axis, a histogram of the frequency of 
runs supporting a given K is visualized in black (mode=26). On the right axis, a density 
plot of the objective function values across all runs is visualized in yellow. The selected 
run, which has the lowest objective among runs with K equal to the distribution’s mode 
(i.e., K=26), is highlighted in red. (C) Heatmap of mean z-scored gene expression (GEX) 
signature activity in cells assigned to those signatures through NMF. (D) Boxplots 
visualizing the activity of gene expression signature GEX-6 across lymphocytes and 
antigen-presenting cells. Cell types with significant activity are denoted in red. The 
horizontal black line corresponds to the median, the box’s hinges correspond to the first 
and third quartiles, the whiskers extend to the largest value within 1.5 times the 
interquartile range, and outliers are visualized with dots past the whisker ends. (E) Forest 
plot showing the effect of mean BL GEX-6 and GEX-13 signature activity in the BM on 
PFS. Hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval, and p-value were computed using Cox 
proportional hazards regression. (F) Boxplots, violin plots, and scatter plots comparing 
the abundance of Cytokine+ CD14+ Monocytes and pDCs between patients classified as 
reactive (n=12) or not (n=12). Violin outline width represents density. P-values were 
computed with Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test. (Box: 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile; 
whiskers: +/- 1.5*IQR).

Figure S6. Granzyme K-expressing CD8+ TEM cells are associated with response to 
therapy, related to Figure 5. (A) Boxplots, violin plots, and scatter plots comparing mean 
GZMK expression levels in T cells of untreated patients (BL) compared to patients at 
EOT. Violin outline width represents density. The p-value was computed using Wilcoxon’s 
rank-sum test. (Box: 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile; whiskers: +/- 1.5*IQR). (B) 
Scatterplot of the proportion of CD8+ T cells that were positive for PD-1 (x-axis), and the 
proportion of CD8+ T cells and were positive for both PD-1 and GZMK (y-axis) by CyTOF. 
A regression line is visualized (in orange), together with its standard error (in light blue). 
The dashed grey lines correspond to the diagonal (y=x) and the vertical distances from 
the regression line to the diagonal. (C) Kaplan-Meier curve of progression-free survival in 
the E-PRISM cohort, stratified based on the mean expression of GZMK across all T cells.

Figure S7. Possible homing of CD16+ monocytes to the patient BM, related to Figure 6. 
Boxplot, violin plot, and scatter plot showing the abundance of CD16+ monocytes in 
patient BM (BM), patient PB (PB), HD BM (NBM), and HD PB (NPB). Violin outline width 
represents density. P-values were computed using a paired t-test for matched patient BM 
and PB samples, and Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test for unmatched HD BM and PB samples. 
(Box: 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile; whiskers: +/- 1.5*IQR).

Figure S8. Cohort diagram and dataset integration, related to STAR Methods. (A) Cohort 
diagram. (B) Scatterplot of immune cell composition principal components 1 (PC1, x axis) 
and 2 (PC2, y axis) demonstrating the absence of an observable batch effect due to the 
samples’ tissue of origin or library preparation technology (n=176).
