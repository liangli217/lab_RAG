Analyzing Frequently Mutated Genes
and the Association With Tumor Mutation Load
To the Editor In their recent article, Li et al1 found that somatic
mutations in MUC16 were associated with high tumor muta-
tion load (TML) and improved survival in patients with gas-
triccancer(GC).Theauthorsconcludedthattheirfindings“may
be immediately applicable for guiding immunotherapy treat-
ment for patients with GC,” giving the impression that MUC16
mutations are special with regard to high TML and improved
survival. However, MUC16 mutations are more likely to be the
result of high TML rather than the cause and do not have a pre-
dictivevalueforprognosisbeyondthatofotherfrequentlymu-
tated genes.
Any gene in the genome has a higher chance of being ran-
domly mutated in tumors with high TML. The MUC16 gene,
which is the second longest gene and covers approximately 65
kb, has a reasonable chance of being mutated in tumors with
high TML. In fact, when reanalyzing the Cancer Genome At-
las GC cohort used by Li et al,1 210 of the 212 genes mutated
in more than 10% of patients with GC are significantly associ-
ated with higher TML (all with P < 10−6, Wilcoxon signed rank
test). This suggests that mutations in highly mutable genes are
indicators, not drivers, of high TML.
This problem of determining significant associations
occurs across many disciplines, and we recently adopted an
approach,2 first applied in the field of numerical ecology,3 to
perform association analyses while controlling for TML.
Empirical P values are calculated by randomizing the muta-
tions in a cohort while maintaining both the total number of
mutations in each patient and each gene. Genes with muta-
tions simply owing to random chance will have the same
association with TML as in the random permutations, and
hence will not be statistically significant. Applying this
approach to the data used by Li et al, MUC16 mutations are
not significantly associated with high TML (empirical
P = .32) or improved survival (23 of 100 randomized sets had
log rank P values < .007 and 32 had lower Wilcoxon test
P values; empirical P = .23).
Furthermore, when associating genes with survival using
a naive approach (without controlling for TML), 25 of the 212
most frequently mutated genes (those mutated in >10% of pa-
tients reported on by Li et al1) are nominally associated with
prolonged survival (log-rank comparison of patients with vs
without a mutation in the gene; P < .05 for all 25 genes). In-
deed, 6 genes (eg, CDH23 and ANK1) were even more signifi-
cant than MUC16, demonstrating that the association with sur-
vival is not unique to MUC16.
Given that almost all frequently mutated genes are asso-
ciated with high TML and that the associations of MUC16 mu-
tations and improved survival with TML are not significant
when controlling for the overall mutation load, we believe that
MUC16 is merely one of many long genes that can reflect high
TML. There is no reason to assume from these analyses that
MUC16 has a special functional association with survival or a
unique prognostic predictive value. Any further analyses re-
garding the functional role of mutations in MUC16 or any other
gene (eg, association with gene expression changes) in GC
shouldtestwhetherthemutationsinthegenereflecthighTML
or selection owing to a functional role.

In Reply Maruvka et al analyzed the associations of MUC16 mu-
tation with tumor mutation load (TML) and survival out-
come in the Cancer Genome Atlas gastric cohort by using the
Curveball algorithm1 to randomize the mutation matrix with-
out altering the row and column totals. In our view, their analy-
sis underestimated the variability of genetic mutation in the
cohort. Their interpretations of the conclusions of our study2
may have resulted from some misunderstanding.
We agree that most frequently mutated genes are associ-
ated with high TML. A higher TML in the tumor genome is
largely reflected by frequent mutation in genes. However, the
associationofMUC16mutationwithTMLdoesnotindicatethat
MUC16 mutation is the driver of high TML. We did not make
this claim in our article.

scribed by Strona and colleagues,1 was developed to random-
ize presence-absence matrices in numerical ecology by fixing
row and column totals. Herein we demonstrate that the vari-
ability of the mutation matrix is likely to be underestimated
when both margin totals are fixed. Let A and B denote 2 bi-
nary mutation matrices with identical dimension ordered
by TML. The dissimilarity d of A and B was measured as
1 −sum(A and B) / sum(A|B). For the binary mutation matrix
of the Cancer Genome Atlas data set, we performed random
permutation with the Curveball algorithm 1000 times and cal-
culated the dissimilarity d between each permutated matrix
and the original binary mutation matrix; the final dissimilar-
ity vector was denoted as dCurveball. In addition, we randomly
sampled with replacement 2 matrices from the original bi-
nary mutation and calculated their dissimilarity. This proce-
dure was also repeated 1000 times; we denoted the dissimi-
larity vector as dsampling. The average value of dCurveball was
significantlysmallerthandsampling(ttest,0.83vs0.88;P < .001),
which suggests that randomizing the binary mutation matrix
with the row and column totals fixed cannot fully capture
the variability of the original mutation matrix. Furthermore,
the TML of a tumor also varies over the course of disease de-
velopment and progression. Thus, application of the Curve-
ball algorithm to examine the associations of gene mutation
with TML and clinical phenotypes is rather conservative.
In our study,1 the association of MUC16 mutations with
TML and improved survival in patients with gastric cancer was
addressed for confounding factors in multivariate models in-
cluding DNA mismatch repair signatures that can be used as
surrogate variables for high TML. These associations were vali-
dated in the independent Asian cohort. The CDH23 and ANK1
genes mentioned by Maruvka et al were not associated with
prognosis in the multivariate Cox analysis of the Asian cohort
(hazardratio[HR],2.15;95%CI,0.55-8.30;P = .27andHR,2.15;
95% CI, 0.59-7.76; P = .24, respectively).
Different algorithms often give rise to different results. The
association of MUC16 mutations with high TML and improved
survivalobtainedfromtraditionalmultivariatelogisticandCox
modelsinourstudyshouldnotbenegatedwhentheresultswere
not significant based on the Curveball algorithm, especially
when the application of this algorithm in such a circumstance
still needs to be discussed. We would like to note that 2 recent
studies reported the association of MUC16 mutations with fa-
vorable prognosis in gastric cancer3 and endometrial cancer by
enhancing cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infiltration.4

Omitted Disclosures of Potential Conflicts of Interest
in Articles Published in JAMA Oncology
To the Editor I write to amend my disclosures of potential
conflicts of interest in articles1-11 published in JAMA Oncology
in 2016 through 2018. In 1 of these articles, “Safety and Effi-
cacy of Pembrolizumab Monotherapy in Patients With Pre-
viously Treated Advanced Gastric and Gastroesophageal
Junction Cancer: Phase 2 Clinical KEYNOTE-059 Trial,”8
which represented a clinical trial of a novel therapeutic in
patients with gastric cancer, I reported relevant disclosures
related to consulting work with the biotechnology and phar-
maceutical industry focused on cancer drug development
as follows: “Dr Fuchs has been a consultant for Eli Lilly,
Entrinsic Health, Pfizer, Merck, Sanofi, Roche, Genentech,
Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Dicerna, Bayer, Agios, Gilead
Sciences, Five Prime Therapeutics, and Taiho.” However,
that disclosure did not include my relationships at the time
with Celgene and KEW. The other studies assessed the role
of obesity, diet, lifestyle habits, and genetic mutations
in cancer risk and outcome,1-7,9-11 and for those articles I
reported that I had no potential conflicts of interest to dis-
closure. With respect to these analyses of obesity, diet, life-
style habits, and genetic mutations and cancer, I did not
consider that my consulting work in drug development rep-
resented a potential conflict of interest or a relevant finan-
cial activity to the submitted works. Additionally, I did not
believe that my consulting work would be perceived by
readers to have influenced or give the appearance of poten-
tially influencing analyses of obesity, diet, lifestyle habits,
and genetic mutations in cancer risk and outcome.
Nevertheless, in the interest of full transparency, I wish to
disclose all relationships with companies that produce prod-
ucts and services related to cancer care and to add the follow-
ing disclosures to each of these articles1-11: “Dr Fuchs has been
a consultant and/or a scientific advisor for Eli Lilly, Entrinsic
Health, Pfizer, Merck, Sanofi, Roche, Genentech, Merrimack
Pharmaceuticals, Dicerna, Bayer, Celgene, Agios, Gilead Sci-
ences,FivePrimeTherapeutics,Taiho,andKEW.”Mostofthose
disclosures were included in the article on pembrolizumab
monotherapy for gastric cancer.8 For that article, published on
March 15, 2018, the following disclosure should also be added:
“Dr Fuchs has been a consultant for Celgene and KEW and also
serves on the Board of Directors for CytomX Therapeutics; in
