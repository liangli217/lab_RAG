one marrow (BM) plasma cell malignancy MM remains an 
incurable disease1. Despite the readily detectable monoclonal 
gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) and smol-
dering MM (SMM) precursor states1–3, treatment is not adminis-
tered until patients progress to MM. Since early premalignancy not 
always leads to progression, treatment cannot be justified solely on 
this basis. Low- and high-risk SMM exhibit 5-year progression rates 
of 15 and 70%, respectively, compared to a 20-year rate of 2 and 27% 
for low- and high-risk MGUS4,5. Therefore, further molecular char-
acterization is required to accurately identify and thwart high-risk 
premalignant MM.
Genomic studies have shown that MGUS/SMM clones may 
already harbor chromosomal alterations that define MM (translo-
cations involving IgH or hyperdiploidy2,6) and that progression can 
be driven by the acquisition of events like MYC translocations, 1q 
gains and TP53 mutations7,8. However, not all patients with MGUS/
SMM with a similar genetic makeup eventually progress to MM, 
implying that further nongenomic alterations may be required for 
disease progression4,9–11. Indeed, it is becoming more recognized 
that tumors represent complex ecosystems12. Not only can tumor 
behavior be regulated by the extracellular milieu13–15, but emerging 
evidence documents that compositional and expression changes 
of individual immune and stromal components correlate with dis-
ease subtypes and prognostic and therapeutic outcomes in breast, 
colorectal and other solid cancers16–20.
Prior studies have confirmed that the BM microenvironment in 
MM exhibits dysregulation in receptor signaling21, cytokine expres-
sion21,22 and numerical alterations in T, natural killer (NK) and 
dendritic cells23–26. MM cells induce immunosuppression, which 
comprises expansion of regulatory T (Treg) cells27,28, myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs)29,30, tumor-associated macrophages31,32 
and dysfunction of NK cells33. Alterations to the microenviron-
ment have been linked to reduced antitumor responses, induction 
of angiogenesis, chemotherapy resistance and progression27,31,34,35.
In this study, we used single-cell transcriptomics to dissect the 
immune microenvironment in the BM in people with MGUS, SMM 
and overt MM compared to healthy donors. We observe that the 
tumor microenvironment exhibits substantial alterations begin-
ning at the MGUS stage, with increased populations of NK cells, 
T  cells and nonclassical monocytes. Among T  cells, we observe 
an early accumulation of regulatory and gamma delta T cells, fol-
lowed by loss of CD8+ memory populations and elevation of IFN 
signaling at the SMM stage. We demonstrate the critical impor-
tance of memory T cells for MM immunosurveillance. In CD14+

Precursor states of multiple myeloma (MM) and its native tumor microenvironment need in-depth molecular characterization 
to better stratify and treat patients at risk. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of bone marrow cells from precursor stages, 
monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance and smoldering MM, to full-blown MM alongside healthy donors, we dem-
onstrate early immune changes during patient progression. We find that natural killer cell abundance is frequently increased 
in the early stages and associated with altered chemokine receptor expression. As early as smoldering MM, we show loss of 
granzyme K+ memory cytotoxic T cells and show their critical role in MM immunosurveillance in mouse models. Finally, we 
report major histocompatibility complex class II dysregulation in CD14+ monocytes, which results in T-cell suppression in vitro. 
These results provide a comprehensive map of immune changes at play over the evolution of premalignant MM, which will help 
develop strategies for immune-based patient stratification.

monocytes, we find dysregulated expression of major histocompat-
ibility complex (MHC) type II genes. We show that MM cells lead to 
loss of antigen presentation, inducing a T-cell suppressive phenotype 
in monocytes. Together, our results characterize transcriptional and 
compositional changes occurring in the BM compartment during 
MM progression. They hint at mechanisms of antitumor immune 
response and immune evasion. Importantly, the immune patterns 
we observed are often heterogeneous across patients and thus may 
prove important biomarkers for risk assessment and therapeutic 
strategies for the prevention of progression in MM.
Results
To better understand the changes occurring in the tumor micro-
environment during MM progression, we performed single-cell 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq; 10x Genomics) on BM aspirates from 
patients at varying stages of progression. We sequenced approxi-
mately 19,000 CD45+/CD138− cells from the microenvironment 
(approximately 15,000 from MM stages) from patients with MGUS 
(n = 5 patients), low-risk SMM (SMM-low; n = 3), high-risk SMM 
(SMM-high; n = 8) and newly diagnosed MM (n = 7), as well as nine 
healthy donors (normal BM (NBM), n = 9; Supplementary Tables 
1 and 2). One patient contributed sequential samples (SMM-low-1 
and MM-8). Patients with SMM were stratified by risk of progres-
sion into low (SMMl) and high (SMMh) based on the Mayo clinic 
established criteria10,36.
The CD45+CD138− subset was isolated using magnetic bead 
sorting of the BM samples and further in silico cell filtering based 
on gene expression (Experimental procedures). By clustering cells 
based on expression profile, we isolated 21 subpopulations. Using 
(1) the expression of known marker genes (Extended Data Fig. 1) 
and (2) finding the top differentially expressed genes for each cluster 
(Supplementary Table 3), we classified our clusters with ten broad cell 
types, ranging from hematopoietic progenitor cells and pre-B cells to 
mature populations engaged in the immune response (Fig. 1a).
Compositional alterations in the microenvironment occur early 
in MM progression. To investigate the relative contribution of dif-
ferent cell types to the microenvironmental repertoire across differ-
ent stages of disease, we searched for populations that were enriched 
on average in the disease microenvironment compared to normal 
BM. Consistent with previous data23–26, we observed a significant 
enrichment in NK, T and CD16+ cells in the diseased BM, as well as 
a relative decrease in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, immature neu-
trophils, CD14+ monocytes and other progenitor cells (Fig. 1b,c). 
Several of these alterations could already be observed as early as 
the MGUS stage. Interestingly, the degree of this compositional shift 
was not uniform across patients. While BM samples from healthy 
donors universally had <2% CD16+ macrophages and <10% NK 
cells, patient samples occupied a spectrum from unaltered composi-
tions to approximately 12% CD16+ macrophages and approximately 
40% NK cells. These changes were observed independent of disease 
stage or tumor burden, suggesting they were mediated by the prop-
erties of the tumor itself or the immune response of the individual 
patients (Fig. 1c). In particular, NK-cell fractions correlated with 
the proportion of nonclassical monocytes and this relationship did 
not correspond to the cytogenetic characteristics of the tumor, dis-
ease stage or tumor burden (Fig. 1d).
NK levels were most elevated in patients with immunoglobulin 
G–secreting tumors, which given their interaction with immuno-
globulin G via the Fc receptor III in normal physiology37, could indi-
cate a reason for their presence or be a factor in their failure to clear 
the disease (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Furthermore, samples with 
overall increases in NK cells were accompanied by a shift in their 
phenotype. Subclustering of NK cells revealed three populations: 
a CXCR4+, a CX3CR1+/CCL3+ and a less frequent IL7R+CD62L+ 
population (markers of the classical immature CD56bright subset38) 
(Fig. 1e). Notably, we observed a correlation between the over-
all fraction of NK cells in a given sample and the representation 
of the CXCR4+ subset (Spearman ρ = 0.60, 95% bootstrapped con-
fidence interval (0.18,0.86), n = 23, samples with ≥5% NK cells; 
Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 2b). Samples with enrichment 
(greater than the median) for NK cell frequency also had signifi-
cant enrichment for the CXCR4+ subset (Fisher exact test, P = 0.012, 
n = 23), while samples with lower NK-cell frequencies displayed 
a shift toward the CX3CR1+ subset (Extended Data Fig. 2c). The 
current understanding is that CXCR4 is required for NK homing 
toward CXCL12-producing cells in the BM and signifies less mature 
NK cells, while CX3CR1 expression causes migration toward BM 
sinusoids, leading to egress from the BM39. This suggests chemotac-
tic relocalization could be the basis for the observed heterogeneity 
in NK-cell frequency.
To further validate the compositional changes observed in our 
sequencing data, we performed simultaneous deep phenotyping of 
viably frozen BM aspirates of patients with MGUS, SMM and MM 
(n = 13) and healthy BM controls (n = 4) using mass cytometry by 
time-of-flight (CyTOF). Overall, CyTOF data correlated with the 
RNA-seq results (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c), with the exception that 
we observed substantially lower neutrophil output from the 10x 
Genomics assay compared to the CyTOF data. While in CyTOF 
neutrophils represented 8–50% of live cells in the BM (Extended 
Data Fig. 3d), the 10x Genomics cell distribution favored T cells and 
monocytes. Due to low messenger RNA content in mature neutro-
phils, they may not be distinguishable as cells in single-cell RNA 
data from empty droplets with ambient RNA. However, this type 
of bias decreases neutrophil counts in both healthy-donor and MM 
samples, and thus should not alter the results for comparisons of a 
given cell type across samples.
Composition of noncytotoxic T cells shows increased Treg num-
bers and patient-specific heterogeneity. To delve deeper into the 
T-cell subtypes and states, we used two complementary approaches. 
First, we performed additional subclustering at higher resolu-
tion using genes variably expressed among T cells, resulting in 12 
subclusters (Fig. 2). Then, because activation of continuous gene 
expression modules may not be captured by discrete clustering, 
we used a Bayesian variant of nonnegative matrix factorization to 
extract seven expression signatures (Fig. 3). First, we examined the 
noncytotoxic subsets marked by high expression of signature T-sig1 
(Fig. 3a). T-cell clusters distinguished by T-sig1 included three 
CCR7-expressing naive CD4 subsets, two populations of helper 
CD4 cells and a population of Treg cells (Fig. 2a–c). An additional 
cluster of helper CD4 cells showed upregulated interferon (IFN) 
type I-activated genes; indeed, in our signature analysis we found 
a corresponding signature of IFN response that was highly upregu-
lated in five late-stage samples (T-sig2, Fig. 4a, 1 SMM-high and 
four MM). In addition, as described previously27,28, we saw a sig-
nificant upregulation of Treg cells in the diseased microenvironment 
(Fig. 2d,e, q = 0.0005, d.f. = 26.1, Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected 
t-test of NBM versus disease samples). Interestingly, transcriptional 
profiles of Treg cells demonstrate high expression of MHC type II 
proteins, which have been reported to inhibit T-cell proliferation 
and cytokine production via an early contact-dependent mecha-
nism40. Additionally, our patient with sequential samples had CD4+ 
subsets that express corticotropin-releasing hormone, which pro-
motes inflammation41.
Cytotoxic T-cell populations shift toward effector phenotype dur-
ing disease progression. Our cytotoxic T cells were broadly sepa-
rated by two signatures of (T-sig4 and T-sig7; Fig. 3a), most notably 
corresponding to the expression of either granzymes B (GZMB, 
GrB) and H (GZMH, GrH; T-sig4) or granzyme K (GZMK, GrK; 
T-sig 7; Fig. 3b), present exclusively in CD8+ cells. The GrK-to-GrB

transition has been associated with the differentiation of cytotoxic 
T cells from memory to effector state42. The T cells marked by the 
GrB expression signature included clusters of CD8+ cytotoxic effec-
tor and gamma delta T cells, in addition to a subpopulation of CD4+ 
cytotoxic cells and NK T  cells predominantly derived from one 
patient (Fig. 2d).
Among cells expressing one of two cytotoxic signatures (con-
sidered as >100 and >50 activity for signatures T-sig4 and T-sig7 
based on their distribution), T-sig7 was more prevalent in healthy 
individuals and patients with MGUS (P = 0.0013, d.f. = 21.5, 
n = 30, t-test on patient mean signature activity across these 
cytotoxic cells between healthy/MGUS and SMM/MM), whereas

the SMM and MM stages presented a striking shift to T-sig4 
(P = 3.1 × 10−4, d.f. = 27.9, n = 30, Fig. 3c), suggesting a depletion of 
memory CD8+ T cells later during disease progression. In support 
of this result, we observed in our CyTOF data a twofold decrease 
in memory CD8+ cells in the BM aspirates of patients with SMM 
(central memory and effector memory T cells, GrA+GrB−; Fig. 3d 
and Extended Data Fig. 4a).
We next examined whether these populations displayed the 
characteristics of T-cell exhaustion. Of four key markers of exhaus-
tion (PDCD1, HAVCR2, LAG3 and TIGIT), we found that only 
LAG3 and TIGIT were expressed at detectable levels and were rela-
tively specific to the cytotoxic subsets (with the exception of TIGIT 
expression on Treg cells; Extended Data Fig. 4b). Across cytotoxic 
T cells, we did not see a difference between healthy individuals and 
patients in the expression of these genes (Extended Data Fig. 4c). 
However, since healthy donor samples primarily were composed of 
GrK+ cytotoxic subsets, we cannot reliably compare the expression 
of specifically GrB+ subsets, which probably would be the relevant 
subsets to display classical exhaustion.
Of note, in our CyTOF data, we observed significantly higher 
expression of the checkpoint receptor programmed cell death 
protein 1 (PD-1) on memory cells in healthy individuals than in 
patients with SMM (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e, P = 0.047). Recent 
publications have connected the expression of PD-1 at the early 
stages of T-cell differentiation with a mechanism for T-cell activa-
tion to balance effector and memory responses43,44; however, its role 
in MM remains to be elucidated.
Notably, the degree of the shift from memory to effector 
was variable, and in several samples, such as MM-7, it was com-
pletely absent. We did not observe any correlation between

plasma cell cytogenetics and types of cells composing the cytotoxic 
T-cell cluster.
To address the role of GrK-expressing cytotoxic memory cells 
in MM progression, we performed in vivo assays using syngeneic 
transplantable myeloma mice with different maturation stages of 
the memory cell pool. For this, 10-week-old KaLwRiJ mice with 
impaired memory cell function and fully immunocompetent older 
animals (1.5 years old) were injected with 5TGM1 MM cells. Young 
mice with impaired memory cells showed significantly shorter sur-
vival than older animals (Fig. 3e). In a similar assay with C57BL/6J 
mice injected with Vk*MYC MM cells, we observed early accumu-
lation of plasma cells in the spleen and faster abundance of mono-
clonal proteins in the blood of younger animals (Fig. 3f,g). However, 
no difference in survival of myeloma-injected mice was obtained 
when animal groups with fully established memory cell pool were 
compared (6-month-old versus 1.5-year-old KaLwRiJ mice; Fig. 3e, 
right panel), providing compelling evidence for a previously unde-
termined critical role of memory cells for immunosurveillance 
against MM. Future studies in age-matched mice are necessary to 
further eliminate potential age-associated confounding factors.
IFN response is seen across immune cell types in late-stage dis-
ease. The T-sig2 signature was highly enriched for IFN-responsive 
genes (for example, STAT1, IFI44L and ISG15) and uniquely present 
in a subset of late-stage patients (Fig. 4a). Likewise, signature analy-
sis in CD14+ monocytes isolated an expression program (M-sig1) 
with highly overlapping marker genes. This signature was present 
in precisely the same samples, suggesting a common response to the 
external signals. Indeed, when we visualized expression of the top 
genes, we observed IFN response in subpopulations of different cell 
types, including NK, nonclassical monocytes and small numbers of 
B cells (Fig. 4b). While this signature was strongly present in 4 out of 
23 samples, which means we are underpowered to directly link it to 
myeloma progression (Fisher exact test, P = 0.054, n = 27), we have 
shown in previous work that IFN signaling is significantly upregu-
lated in malignant plasma cells27. Interrogating a publicly available 
dataset from CD138-enriched plasma cells at different stages of the 
MM disease (n = 147) and healthy donors (n = 15, GSE6477) for the 
expression of ISG15 and MX1, which scored highly in gene signature 
analyses in our single-cell data, we found a significantly increased 
expression of these genes throughout MM progression (Extended 
Data Fig. 5). Thus, our data from the immune microenvironment 
provide evidence that signaling in this context occurs not just in 
myeloma cells, but across immune populations.
CD14+ monocytes in the MM microenvironment show defec-
tive antigen presentation due to intracellular accumulation of 
human leukocyte antigen DR isotype (HLA-DR). In addition to 
the IFN signature found in CD14+ monocytes, we discovered that 
the M-sig2 signature was significantly upregulated in all malig-
nant cases (t-test, n = 30, d.f. = 19.7, q = 1.3 × 10−6). The majority of 
genes highly contributing to this signature were encoding the MHC 
class II cell surface receptor (HLA-DRA, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRB1 
and HLA-DPA1; q ≤ 2 × 10−4; Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). 
Expression of MHC class II encoding genes individually was sig-
nificantly upregulated in CD14+ monocytes/macrophages across 
all disease stages, including MGUS (Fig. 5a and Extended Data 
Fig. 6a). The mRNA levels of MHC class II receptors together with 
the expression of IFN-activated genes predominantly determined 
the organization of CD14+ monocytic subclusters (Extended Data 
Fig. 6b). Additional subclusters were built from individual patients 
with high expression of the mannose receptor C-type 1 (MRC1), 
CCL3/4 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein signaling (Extended 
Data Fig. 6b).
However, study of MHC class II expression using CyTOF 
revealed that despite elevated mRNA levels, CD14+ cells from 
patients with SMM and MM exhibited significantly lower HLA-DR 
surface expression compared to those from healthy donors 
(Fig. 5b), suggesting pathway dysregulation yet resulting in com-
promised antigen presentation in these cells. To elucidate whether 
this change in expression represented a shift in cell subpopula-
tions (for example, MDSCs are known to have low levels of MHC 
class II surface presentation) or a phenotypic change specifically 
induced by the myeloma cells, we cocultured CD14+ cells isolated 
from the peripheral blood of healthy donors with MM.1S or RPMI 
8226 myeloma cells and analyzed HLA-DRA mRNA and HLA-DR 
and HLA-DP surface expression levels. Indeed, while quantita-
tive reverse-transcription PCR showed a significant increase of 
HLA-DRA mRNA in monocytes cocultured with MM cells, as 
compared to coculture with CD19+ control cells (Extended Data 
Fig. 7a), a dramatic drop in the surface expression of both HLA-DR 
and HLA-DP molecules was observed (Fig. 5c, left panel). However, 
the proportion of CD14+ cells expressing HLA-DR and HLA-DP 
intracellularly remained similar or slightly lower compared to that 
in controls (Fig. 5c, right panel). We observed intracellular accu-
mulation of HLA-DR in CD14-expressing cells in tissue microarray 
(TMA) slides of patients with MM compared to membrane-bound 
HLA-DR in CD14 monocytes from healthy donors (Fig. 5d and 
Extended Data Fig. 7b). Taken together, our results suggest that MM

on CD14+ cells cocultured with CD19+ cells or with RPMI 8226 cells in Transwells or direct coculture were 94.2, 60.4 and 31.3 for HLA-DR and 64.6, 35.9 
and 1.7 for HLA-DP, respectively. The median values of 97.0, 97.2 and 91.2 for HLA-DR and 75.8, 86.2 and 6.4 for HLA-DP were detected on the surface of 
CD14+ cells after similar experimental settings with MM1.S cells. The median proportion of CD14+ cells expressing HLA-DR intracellularly was 97.8, 96.4 
and 98.0; 96.7, 95.9 and 96.0 for HLA-DP in coculture with RPMI 8226; 97.9, 98.6 and 91.9 for HLA-DR; and 96.8, 97.8 and 90.9 for HLA-DP in coculture 
with MM1.S cells, respectively. The experiment was performed with three independent donors for two different cell lines in triplicate. Significance was

cells induce internalization of MHC class II in CD14+ cells, reduc-
ing their potential for antigen presentation.
Looking for the alterations in the expression of genes 
responsible for the posttranslational control of MHC class II, 
we found the gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 
MARCHF1/MARCH1 to be progressively upregulated in patients 
compared to healthy individuals (P = 0.008) and found decreased 
levels of the gene encoding ER-resident protein VAMP associ-
ated protein A (VAPA), which plays a role in the inward trans-
port of MHC class II (P = 0.01, Fig. 5e). By treating CD14+ cells 
cocultured with MM cell lines with anti-MARCHF1/MARCH1 
small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), we rescued HLA-DR surface 
presentation (Extended Data Fig. 8). Thus, our results suggest 
that the upregulation of MARCHF1/MARCH1 observed in our 
single-cell RNA dataset could indeed lead to internalization of 
MHC class II in monocytes in the MM microenvironment.
CD14+ monocytes in the MM microenvironment can promote 
proliferation of myeloma cells and suppress T-cell activation.

as one of the subsets of monocytic MDSCs (mMDSC), we wanted to 
further characterize the CD14+HLA-DRlow cell population from the 
MM environment and understand its role in myeloma progression 
and immune suppression. According to our sequencing results, the 
population of CD14+ cells expressed CD11b at levels similar to those 
in healthy cells. Likewise, it expressed various markers that define 
mature macrophages, such as CD86, CD163 and CD68, with highly 
elevated CD206 in one patient (Extended Data Fig. 9a). According 
to suggested guidelines for the characterization of MDSCs45, we 
did not observe increased expression of MDSC-associated genes 
in patients relative to healthy donors (Extended Data Fig. 9b). 
Furthermore, CD14+ cells from healthy donors after coculture 
with MM cells expressed inducible nitric oxide synthase, CD206 
and CD163 and did not polarize toward the Lin−CD11b+CD33+ 
mMDSC phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Thus, while this cell 
population may overlap with CD14+CD11b+HLA-DRlow popula-
tions termed mMDSCs described in other studies, our results agree 
with the observation of others that additional markers are needed to 
isolate myeloid cells with a specific mMDSC phenotype.
Interestingly, after coculture of myeloma cell lines (MM1.S, 
RPMI 8226, OPM-2, KMS-18) with CD14+HLA-DRlow cells, we 
observed significant changes in the cell cycle of MM1.S cells result-
ing in a significantly increased fraction of cells in the S (P = 0.006) 
and G2M (P = 0.0012) phases of the cell cycle, as compared to that in

CD44 activation marker in T cells after coculture with CD14+ cells 
that were preconditioned with MM cells (Fig. 6c). In contrast to 
B-cell controls, CD8+ cells after coculture with CD14+ monocytes 
from the MM environment showed reduced expression of CD44 
(Fig. 6d), indicating suppression of T-cell activation. In a similar 
experiment with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
cocultured with either CD14+ cells or CD19+ B cells isolated from 
the BM aspirates of patients with SMM (Fig. 6e), we observed 
downregulation of CD44 in CD4+ T cells cocultured with CD14+ 
cells (Fig. 6f).
Altogether, these results indicate that CD14+HLA-DRlow cells 
from the myeloma environment can accelerate proliferation of MM 
cells and exhibit suppressive activity by inhibiting T-cell activation.
Discussion
Myeloma is an incurable disease that can cause irreversible organ 
damage. Early intervention represents an attractive alternative for 
treatment, although we cannot accurately predict which patients 
with MGUS/SMM will progress. Further understanding of dis-
ease progression requires comprehensive molecular character-
ization, including that of the tumor’s microenvironment and the 
host’s immune response. In this study, we used single-cell RNA-seq 
(scRNA-seq) of patient samples across all stages of MM to elucidate 
the transcriptomic alterations within the immune microenviron-
ment along disease progression.
Through analysis of the cellular composition of the tumor 
microenvironment, we showed a significant, albeit heterogeneous, 
enrichment of T cells, CD16+ monocytes and NK cells established 
at the MGUS stage of the disease, indicating an early launch of 
an immune response. Indeed, expansion of T and NK cells in the 
peripheral blood and BM of patients with hematopoietic malig-
nancies, including MM, has been reported previously23–25,46–48 and 
has been associated with improved outcomes in MM33,38,49,50. Using 
scRNA-seq, we characterized the subtypes and expression states of 
these populations.
Our analysis further revealed that in patients with high 
NK-cell infiltration, this fraction is predominantly composed of 
CXCR4-expressing cells, while samples with fewer NK cells have a 
shift toward CX3CR1 expression. Previous studies have shown that 
these receptors are responsible for chemotaxis, mediating homing 
to the BM or facilitating BM egress39. If in certain subsets MM may 
initiate the egress of NK cells into the circulation51, this may explain 
the heterogeneous frequency of NK cells observed in our data and 
could suggest an MM-orchestrated mechanism of immune evasion.
Interrogation of the cytotoxic compartment demonstrates that, 
starting from SMM, there is a loss of memory cells with consider-
able skewing of T-cell differentiation toward the GrB/H-expressing 
effector state. From our in vivo results, we demonstrate the previ-
ously unrecognized pivotal role of memory cells in the immune 
response against tumor cells. It is important to note that the pro-
portion of the effector cell subtypes did not correlate with the cyto-
genetic characteristics of the tumor. Individual subpopulations of 
cytotoxic effectors, including NK T cells, gamma delta T cells, CD4+ 
and CD8+ effector cells are well described and their functionality in 
MM is under extensive investigation. In MM, these cytotoxic cells 
often exhibit either suppressed phenotype (as CD8+ T  cells52) or 
anergy (as in gamma delta T cells53) and impaired functionality as 
reported for NK T cells54, and several approaches have been tested 
to overcome this dysregulation55,56.
The immunosuppressive role of MDSCs, CD14+HLA-DRlow/neg 
cells from the monocytic lineage, has been previously established 
in lymphoma, glioblastoma, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma 
and MM29,57–59. Our data demonstrate that in addition to MDSCs, 
mature CD14+ monocytes/macrophages also undergo a phenotypic 
shift leading to loss of MHC class II surface representation as early 
as in the MGUS stage. These CD14+ cells with compromised MHC 
class II representation acquire immunosuppressive potential and can 
suppress T-cell activation. We demonstrated that overexpression of 
MARCHF1/MARCH1 contributes to the internalization of MHC 
class II proteins. Importantly, this condition can be rescued by down-
regulating MARCHF1/MARCH1 expression, offering a potential for 
therapeutic interventions. Overall, this signaling was impaired in 
the majority of patients already at the early precursor MGUS stage, 
indicating that monocytes/macrophages are very sensitive to the 
MM-directed shaping of a permissive tumor microenvironment.
Extensive coregulatory networks have been described in the 
tumor microenvironment, whereby tumor cells regulate the stromal 
and immune microenvironment and vice versa, all in support of 
tumor growth and dissemination16,17. We have previously demon-
strated that IFN type I secreted from MM cells promotes immu-
nosuppression, which favors MM growth60. In this study, we found 
highly upregulated IFN signaling across immune subsets. Thus, our 
results further implicate IFN signaling in MM and indicate that 
such a complex regulatory network could already be in place at the 
high-risk SMM stage of disease, identifying it as a potential target 
for therapeutic intervention to prevent progression.
We profiled sequential immune alterations occurring during 
MM progression, beginning at the earliest stage (Extended Data 
Fig. 10). MM represents a unique setting with a readily detectable 
premalignant stage; observing early immune alterations in response 
to a neoplastic environment raises the possibility of similar mecha-
nisms appearing in the precursors of other cancers. It is our hope 
that understanding this evolution of the myeloma microenviron-
ment will provide new targets for therapeutic approaches, and that 
leveraging inter-patient heterogeneity will enable stratification of 
patients by risk of progression and create the opportunity for early 
intervention.
Methods
Patient samples and cell preparation. Primary peripheral blood cells or BM 
samples from patients with MGUS, SMM or MM, as well as healthy donors were 
collected at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. These studies were approved by 
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board. Informed consent 
was obtained from all patients and healthy volunteers in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki protocol (fifth revision from 2000 with Clarifications of 
Articles 29, 30 (2002–2004), and the most recent iteration from 2013). CD138− 
or CD45+ BM cell fractions were isolated using magnetic-activated cell sorting 
technology (Miltenyi Biotec). Selected cells were either viably cryopreserved 
in dimethylsulfoxide at a final concentration of 10% or used immediately for 
scRNA-seq.
Human MM.1S and RPMI 8226 cells were purchased from ATCC, while the 
KMS-18 myeloma cell line was obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research 
Bioresources and the OPM-2 cell line was obtained from DSMZ. For the in vitro 
experiments, these cell lines were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 
(RPMI) 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM of 
l-glutamine, 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin (Gibco).
Sequencing library construction using the 10x Genomics platform. Frozen BM 
cells were rapidly thawed, washed, counted and resuspended in PBS and 0.04% 
bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 1,000 cells per μl. The Chromium 
Controller (10x Genomics) was used for parallel sample partitioning and molecular 
barcoding61. To generate a single-cell Gel Bead in EMulsion, cellular suspensions 
were loaded on a Single Cell 3′ chip together with the Single Cell 3′ Gel Beads, 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics). scRNA-seq libraries 
were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library Kit v.2 (10x Genomics). 
Fourteen cycles were used for the total complementary DNA amplification reaction 
and for the total sample index PCR. Generated libraries were combined according 
to Illumina specifications and paired-end sequenced on HiSeq 2500/4000 
platforms with standard Illumina sequencing primers for both sequencing and 
index reads; 100 cycles were used to sequence Read1 and Read2.
Preprocessing of scRNA-seq data. Sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, 
alignment to the human genome (hg38) and single-cell 3′ gene counting was 
performed using the Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite v.2.0.1. Cells called by

Cell Ranger were further filtered to those with <10% mitochondrial expression, 
>200 genes covered and >600 total unique molecular identifiers. Expression values 
were calculated as:
eg;c ¼ log 104
Nc
ng;c þ 1


for a cell c with Nc total unique molecular identifiers, ng,c of which map to gene g.
Separation of plasma and immune cell populations. To remove cells incorrectly 
sorted during bead selection (that is, plasma cells in the CD138− fractions), we first 
performed coarse clustering of the data including all cells. We selected 2,744 genes 
with high expression and dispersion, excluding genes on the sex chromosomes, 
and z-normalized the data after regressing out variation due to total number of 
unique molecular identifiers or percentage mitochondrial RNA in each cell. We 
then performed Seurat k-nearest neighbors clustering with resolution 0.6 on 
the first 20 principal components of the resulting data. A plasma cell score was 
calculated for each cluster as the mean expression of CD138 (SDC1), CD319 
(SLAMF7) and BCMA (TNFRSF17); clusters with a score of >1 were identified as 
plasma cell clusters. Clusters with >4 mean HBA1 expression were deemed to be 
erythroid clusters, and cells in these clusters were excluded from future analyses. 
Cells originating from the CD138− fraction in nonplasma, nonerythroid clusters 
formed our immune cell dataset.
Gene selection. When selecting genes for downstream analysis, we excluded 
genes with high potential to be influenced by cross-cell contamination effects. 10x 
technology exhibits lows rates of mRNAs associated with the barcodes of cells from 
which they did not originate, possibly from sources such as extracellular mRNAs 
captured in the droplet. While in the vast majority of cases this is undetectable, 
for ultra-highly expressed genes such as immunoglobulins, the contributions 
can become noticeable. Thus, we excluded genes that were drastically higher in 
expression for the excluded compartments (plasma cells and erythroid cells).
In addition, we filtered genes found to have a strong sex bias in our data. 
For the purposes of clustering analyses, we removed all genes from the sex 
chromosomes to avoid any cumulative effects that could separate samples based on 
sex. For downstream gene- or signature-level analyses, so as not to lose informative 
genes on the X chromosome, we only excluded genes found to have a statistically 
significant sex bias (two-sample t-test on mean gene expression at a false discovery 
rate threshold of 10%).
Analysis of immune cell populations. A total of 2,100 variably expressed genes 
were identified using the filtering procedure described earlier and the same 
expression and dispersion criteria as in the analysis of principal components. 
Clusters were identified using Seurat k-nearest neighbors clustering with resolution 
1.4 on the first 20 principal components of the z-normalized data. Cell types were 
then identified for each cluster by examining the expression of marker genes, as 
well as the top differentially expressed genes, in each cluster. Cells were visualized 
by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) on the same 20 principal 
components.
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-derived gene expression signatures. 
We defined gene expression signatures for T cells and CD14+ monocytes 
using our SignatureAnalyzer-GPU62 tool (https://github.com/broadinstitute/
SignatureAnalyzer-GPU), which implements a previously described Bayesian 
NMF algorithm63. This method approximates the expression profile of each cell 
(represented as a column in the input matrix) as an additive combination of 
latent expression programs (each column in the W-matrix output), each with an 
associated weight or ‘activity’ in each cell given by the H-matrix. This Bayesian 
variant of NMF encourages sparse interpretable solutions by imposing an 
exponential prior distribution on the weights of the W- and H-matrices and allows 
automatic discovery of the number of signatures required to explain the data.
After signature discovery, the columns of W were normalized to a sum of 1 and 
all the weight was shifted into the H-matrix:
W0
g;k ¼
Wg;k
PG
g0¼1 Wg0;k
H0
k;p ¼
XG
g¼1 Wg;k


Hk;p
for gene g (out of G total genes), signature k and patient p. Signatures significantly 
altered between disease states were identified by calculating the mean signature 
activity for each patient and performing a two-sample t-test, reporting results 
below a 10% Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate level. Marker genes for each 
signature were identified by sorting genes according to their relative contribution 
to each signature:
Wg;k
PK
k0¼1 Wg;k0
and taking the top 10 genes where the gene contributed at least 1% of the total 
signature activity.
Analysis of cells by CyTOF. Sample staining for mass cytometry (CyTOF) was 
performed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Fluidigm). Briefly, the 
CD138− or CD45+ populations of BM samples from patients with MM or healthy 
donors were thawed, washed and barcoded using the Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd Barcoding 
Kit (Fluidigm). After barcoding, cells were incubated with human Fc Receptor 
Blocking Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec) and human surface marker antibodies as 
a single multiplexed sample (Maxpar Human Immune Monitoring Panel Kit, 
29-marker panel; Fluidigm). After staining, cells were washed in Maxpar Cell 
Staining Buffer (Fluidigm), resuspended at the concentration of 1 × 106 cells ml−1 
and acquired on a CyTOF Helios mass cytometer (Fluidigm). Downstream 
analysis of the individual component samples was performed after running the 
debarcoding application. An automated analysis GemStone MC software (Verity, 
provided by Maxpar, Fluidigm) was used to clean the data files by automatically 
identifying and removing cell doublets, debris and dead cells, as well as identifying 
major immune cell subsets. Expression levels of HLA-DR molecules on the cell 
surface were analyzed in Cytobank (Cytobank).
To phenotype the Gr-expressing T-cell populations, CyTOF was performed 
on CD138− cells from the BM aspirates of patients with SMM and healthy donors 
using TIGIT-143Nd, PD-1-175Lu, TIM3-153Eu (Maxpar) and the Maxpar Human 
T-Cell Phenotyping Panel Kit, 16 Marker. T-cell subsets were defined as suggested 
by the manufacturer.
Flow cytometry analysis. Antihuman antibodies against CD138 (clone MI15), 
CD14 (clone 63D3), HLA-DR (clone L243) were obtained from BioLegend. 
HLA-DP (clone DP11.1) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. iNOS 
(catalog no. ab115819) was obtained from Abcam. CD33 (catalog no. 303413), 
CD11b (catalog no. 301341), CD206 (catalog no. 321113), CD163 (catalog no. 
33362) and FITC antihuman Lineage Cocktail (catalog no. 348801) were obtained 
from BioLegend. Antibodies were used for fluorescence-activated cell sorting 
(FACS) analyses. The LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) was used for the discrimination of dead cells. Data from the 
stained samples was acquired using a FACS Canto II Flow Cytometer (BD 
Biosciences). The results were analyzed in Cytobank (Cytobank).
Myeloma cell coculture assay. Human CD14+ monocytes or CD19+ B cells were 
obtained from fresh peripheral blood cells using CD14 and CD19 MicroBeads 
(Miltenyi Biotec). Briefly, red blood cells were lysed (RBC Lysis Buffer; BioLegend), 
washed and CD14+ and CD19+ cell populations were isolated according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. CD14+ monocytes at 2 × 106 were cocultured 
with 1 × 106 myeloma cell lines. CD19+ B cells were used as a negative control. 
Transwell-permeable inserts with a pore size of 0.4 μm were used to prevent 
cell–cell interactions (Corning). After 3–4 d of coculture, cells were collected and 
analyzed for HLA-DR expression using flow cytometry or quantitative PCR.
siRNA knockdown of MARCHF1/MARCH1. MARCHF1/MARCH1 knockdown 
in CD14+ cells was performed using anti-MARCHF1/MARCH1 siRNAs (catalog 
nos. 127048 and 127049; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX 
Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Briefly, CD14+ monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of 
healthy donors using CD14 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and plated into 24-well 
plates at 0.5 × 106 in 500 μl; 5 pmol of siRNA was used per well. Silencer Negative 
Control No. 1 siRNA (catalog no. AM4611; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as 
a negative control. Twelve hours posttransfection, 1 × 106 MM cells were added and 
cultured for the next 24 h. Cells were collected and analyzed for the HLA-DR and 
MARCHF1/MARCH1 expression using flow cytometry or immunofluorescence 
microscopy.
RNA isolation and quantitative PCR with reverse-transcription (RT–qPCR). 
mRNA was isolated with the miRNeasy Mini Kit (catalog no. 217004; QIAGEN). 
Purified RNA was measured by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cDNA 
was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse 
Transcription Kit (catalog no. 4368814; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Expression levels 
of HLA-DRA were obtained using a TaqMan qPCR assay (Hs.PT.58.14332844) 
and an actin assay as the internal control (Hs.PT.39a.22214847) from Integrated 
DNA Technologies. To measure the expression of different MARCHF1/MARCH1 
transcripts, two primer pairs were designed and MARCHF1/MARCH1 RT–qPCR 
reactions were prepared using the PowerTrack SYBR Green Master Mix (catalog 
no. 4367659; Thermo Fisher Scientific). TaqMan and SYBR green reactions were 
carried out on Quant Studio 7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The assays were run in 
triplicate using CD14+ cells isolated from three independent donors. The ΔΔCt 
method was used for normalization on the actin and GAPDH housekeeping 
genes. The primer sequences of MARCHF1/MARCH1 and GAPDH were: 
MARCHF1/MARCH1 pair 2 forward, 5′-CAGGAGCCAGTCAAGGTTGT-3′; 
MARCHF1/MARCH1 pair 2 reverse, 5′-AGAGCTCACAGCAGCGTGTA-3′; 
MARCHF1/MARCH1 pair 3 forward, 5′-TAATCGCGATCACCTGTGTG-3′; 
MARCHF1/MARCH1 pair 3 reverse, 5′-GCGCCACAACTGAACATAGA-3′;

5′-GCCCAATACGACCAAATCC-3′.
5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) proliferation assay. MM cells were cocultured 
with CD14+ monocytes isolated from the PBMCs of healthy donors for 48 h. MM 
cells cocultured with CD19+ B cells were used as the control. After coculture, 
cells were labeled with 1 mM of BrdU for 2 h and then stained with antibodies for 
surface expression of CD138 (clone MI15) and CD14 (clone 63D3). After this, 
cells were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm Buffer according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol (catalog no. 552598; BD Biosciences) before staining with 
allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-BrdU for 20 min. Total DNA was stained 
using a 7-AAD solution (catalog no. 555816, BD Biosciences). The cell cycle of 
CD138+ MM cells was analyzed using flow cytometry.
Mixed lymphocyte reaction. The mixed lymphocyte reaction was performed in 
duplicate in 96-well, round-bottom plates (catalog no. 7007; Corning). PBMCs 
were cultured in the RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, 11875) supplemented with 
100 U ml−1 of penicillin-streptomycin (catalog no. 15140122; Gibco), 10% (vol/vol)  
fetal calf serum (catalog no. A31604; Gibco) and 50 μM of 2-mercaptoethanol 
(catalog no. M6250; Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM of l-glutamine (catalog no. 25030081; 
Gibco) for 3 d at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. Cells were stimulated with 4 μg ml−1 of 
antihuman CD3 antibody (clone OKT3, catalog no. 317302; BioLegend), 4 μg ml–1 
antihuman CD28 antibody (clone CD28.2, catalog no. 302902; BioLegend) and 
200 ng of recombinant human IL-2 (catalog no. 200-02; PeproTech).
CD14+ cells were isolated from healthy PBMCs and cocultured with either 
MM cell lines (OPM-2, MM1.S) or healthy CD19+ B cells for 24 h in a 1:2 ratio. 
After 24 h, CD14+ cells were isolated and added as modulators to the freshly 
isolated PBMCs from healthy donors. The cell number of responder versus 
modulator cells was 1 × 105:8 × 103 in the final volume of 200 μl per well. PBMCs 
without modulator cells served as a reaction system control. In the second 
experimental setup, CD14+ or CD19+ cells isolated from fresh BM aspirate of a 
patient with SMM were used as modulators and PBMCs from the same patient 
were used as responders. Cells were collected at days 3–5 for flow cytometry 
(FACSCanto II; BD Biosciences). The LIVE/DEAD Fixable Green Dead Cell 
Stain Kit (catalog no. L23101; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to gate out the 
dead cells. The antibodies used in this experiment were (all BioLegend): PerCP/
Cy5.5 antihuman CD4 (clone OKT4; catalog no. 317428); Brilliant Violet 510 
anti-mouse/human CD44 (clone IM7, catalog no.103044); APC/Cy7 antihuman 
CD8a (clone HIT8a; catalog no. 300926).
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded tissue sections were baked in an Isotemp Oven at 60 °C for 
30 min to melt excess paraffin. Tumor sections were stained with BOND RX 
Autostainer (Leica Biosystems) using the BOND Polymer Refine Detection Kit 
(catalog no. DS9800; Leica Biosystems). Antigen retrieval was performed with 
the BOND Epitope Retrieval Solution 1 (citrate, pH = 6.0; Leica Biosystems) for 
30 min. Dual-immunohistochemistry staining was performed using anti-CD14 
(1:100, clone D7A2T; Cell Signaling Technology), which was detected by the Alexa 
Fluor 594 Tyramide Reagent (catalog no. B40957; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 
anti-HLA-DR (1:500, clone TAL.1B5; Dako) detected by Alexa Fluor 488 Tyramide 
Reagent (catalog no. B40953; Thermo Fisher Scientific). NucBlue Fixed Cell 
ReadyProbes Reagent (DAPI; catalog no. R37606; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was 
used as the background stain.
For cytospins, CD14+ cells transfected with siRNA and cocultured with  
MM cells for 24 h were purified using flow cytometry. Cells were fixed  
with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS and diluted to no more than  
0.5 × 106 cells ml−1. Then, 100 μl of cell suspension was loaded into a cuvette with 
the slides mounted with the paper pad. The cuvette was placed into a metal holder 
and centrifuged at 800 r.p.m. for 5 min. After centrifugation, cells were immediately 
fixed, permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer and incubated with primary 
antibodies for MARCHF1/MARCH1 (1:100, catalog no. PA5-53199; Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and HLA-DR (1:100, catalog no. 307602; BioLegend) for 1 h. Slides were 
washed for 15 min in PBS and incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies 
(Abcam) for 1 h. Post-incubation, slides were washed twice and mounted using 
DAPI mounting solution (Dako).
In vivo assays. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. 
C57BL/KalwRiJ mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories. All mice were 
treated, monitored and euthanized in accordance with the approved protocol of the 
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee; 4 × 106 5TGM1 
cells were injected intravenously into C57BL/KalwRiJ mice for survival studies, 
while 4 × 106 Vk*MYC cells were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice for 
monoclonal protein secretion (M spike) and plasma cell infiltration analyses.  
At 3 weeks postinjection, BM cells and peripheral blood were collected. BM cells 
were obtained through flushing of femurs with 1× PBS. The proportion of CD138+ 
plasma cells was determined after cell staining with the APC anti-mouse CD138 
antibody (catalog no. 142505; BioLegend) by flow cytometry. An M spike analysis 
was performed with 1 μl of blood serum using QuickGel electrophoresis  
(Helena Laboratories).
Statistical analysis of in vivo and in vitro studies. One-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) and Tukey multiple comparison test were used when three or more 
independent groups were compared. An unpaired Student’s t-test was used to 
compare two independent groups. All tests were two-tailed. The log-rank test was 
used to analyze survival data. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistics and reproducibility. No statistical method was used to predetermine 
sample size. Samples with insufficient numbers of cells or library complexity were 
excluded from the analyses. Investigators were not blinded to the study of human 
sequencing data.
