Although a few cancer genes are mutated in a high proportion of tumours of a given type (.20%), most are mutated at
intermediate frequencies (2–20%). To explore the feasibility of creating a comprehensive catalogue of cancer genes, we
analysed somatic point mutations in exome sequences from 4,742 human cancers and their matched normal-tissue
samples across 21 cancer types. We found that large-scale genomic analysis can identify nearly all known cancer genes in
these tumour types. Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not previously known to be significantly mutated in
cancer, including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion,
RNA processing and protein homeostasis. Down-sampling analysis indicates that larger sample sizes will reveal many
more genes mutated at clinically important frequencies. We estimate that near-saturation may be achieved with 600–
5,000 samples per tumour type, depending on background mutation frequency. The results may help to guide the next
stage of cancer genomics.
Comprehensive knowledge of the genes underlying human cancers is a
critical foundation for cancer diagnostics, therapeutics, clinical-trial
design and selection of rational combination therapies. It is now pos-
sible to use genomic analysis to identify cancer genes in an unbiased
fashion, based on the presence of somatic mutations at a rate signifi-
cantly higher than the expected background level.
Systematic studies have revealed many new cancer genes, as well as
new classes of cancer genes1,2. They have also made clear that, although
some cancer genes are mutated at high frequencies, most cancer genes
in most patients occur at intermediate frequencies (2–20%) or lower.
Accordingly, a complete catalogue of mutations in this frequency class
will be essential for recognizing dysregulated pathways and optimal
targets for therapeutic intervention. However, recent work suggests
majorgapsinourknowledgeofcancergenesofintermediatefrequency.
For example, a study of 183 lung adenocarcinomas3 found that 15% of
patients lacked even a single mutation affecting any of the 10 known
hallmarks of cancer, and 38% had 3 or fewer such mutations.
In this paper, we analysed somatic point mutations (substitutions
and small insertion and deletions) in nearly 5,000 human cancers and
their matched normal-tissue samples (‘tumour–normal pairs’) across
21 tumour types. The questions that we examine here are: first, whether
large-scale genomic analysis across tumour types can reliably identify
all known cancer genes; second, whether it will reveal many new can-
didate cancer genes; and third, how far we are from having a complete
catalogue of cancer genes (at least those of intermediate frequency). We
used rigorous statistical methods to enumerate candidate cancer genes
and then carefully inspected each gene to identify those with strong
biological connections to cancer and mutational patterns consistent
with the expected function.
The analysis reveals nearly all known cancer genes and revealed 33
novel candidates, including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis,
genome stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA pro-
cessing and protein homeostasis. Importantly, the data show that the
catalogue of cancer genes is still far from complete, with the number of
candidate cancer genes still increasing sharply with sample size. These
analyses enable us to estimate the sample sizes that will be needed to
approach saturation.
Cancer-genome data
We collected and analysed data from 4,742 samples, consisting prim-
arily of whole-exome sequence from tumour–normal pairs. The sam-
ples span 21tumourtypes,whichinclude 12fromThe Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) and 14 from non-TCGA projects at the Broad Institute,
with some overlapping tumour types (Table 1 and Supplementary
Table 1). The number of samples per tumour type varied between 35
and 892.
Data were all analysed through the Broad’s stringent filtering and an-
notation pipeline to obtain a uniform set of mutation calls (Methods).
The data set consists of 3,078,483 somatic single nucleotide variations
(SSNVs), 77,270 small insertions and deletions (SINDELs) and 29,837
somatic di-, tri- or oligonucleotide variations (DNVs, TNVs and ONVs,
respectively), with an average of 672 per tumour–normal pair. The muta-
tions include 540,831 missense, 207,144 synonymous, 46,264 nonsense,
33,637 splice-site, and 2,294,935 non-coding mutations (used to improve
ourbackgroundmodel).Theanalysishassensitivityof.90%basedonthe

Mutation frequencies vary over more than five orders of magnitude

approximately3,000samples(ofwhich2,502 areincluded in thisdata set)
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Mutation spectra also vary sharply within and
across tumour types6 (Supplementary Fig. 2).

and small insertion or deletions) at a statistically significant rate or
pattern in cancer. (Such genes will ultimately need to be verified by
biological experiments to be considered validated cancer genes.) In this
paper,wedonotseektoimplicategenes basedonother criteria(suchas
amplification or deletion, translocations or epigenomic modification;
however, see ref. 7 for an analysis of copy-number alterations across
many tumour types).
In principle, candidate cancer genes can be discovered by sequencing
enough tumour–normal pairs; based on the presence of an excess of
somatic mutations compared to expectation. However, careful analysis
is required to assess statistical significance. The mere presence of so-
matic mutations is insufficient to implicate a gene in cancer, inasmuch
as 93% of genes carried mutations in at least five samples.
We showed recently6 that heterogeneity of mutation rates and pat-
terns in cancer can give rise to false positives and described methods to
overcome this problem. We applied these methods to identify candidate
cancer genes. We used the most recent version of the MutSig suite of
tools (Supplementary Fig. 3a and Methods), which looks for three inde-
pendentsignals:highmutationalburdenrelativetobackgroundexpecta-
tion, accounting for heterogeneity; clustering of mutations within the
gene8; and enrichment of mutations in evolutionarily conserved sites8.
We combined the significance levels(P values) fromeach test to obtain a
single significance level per gene (Methods).
We analysed each tumour type separately, as well as the entire cohort
(‘combined’ set), using the same methodology to ensure that the results
can be compared across types. We verified that each analysis accurately
calculates the significance level of genes, based on the fact that the vast
majority of genes fit the nullhypothesis and lie on thediagonal in a Q–Q
plot(SupplementaryFig.3b).Foreachanalysis,geneswithfalsediscovery

Using an FDR of q # 0.1 ensures that the expected fraction of false posi-

tives,whilecontrollingtheproportionoffalsepositives.Wealsoanalysed
the merged set of gene3 tumour-type pairs identified from the 22 indi-
vidual analyses (here we include the combined set as one of the ‘tumour
types’), using methods discussed below.
Data and results are posted at http://www.tumorportal.org/. The
site includes graphical displays of the mutations in each of the 18,388
genes studied; see examples in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4. The
site also includes tables of mutational data for each significant gene
and Q–Q plots for each statistical test.
Candidate cancer genes across 21 tumour types
A total of 334 gene 3 tumour-type pairs were found by our analysis to
be significantly mutated. These 334 pairs involve 224 distinct genes.
The number of genes detected per tumour type varied considerably
(range of 1–58), with 7 types having fewer than 10 genes and 2 (breast
and endometrial) having more than 30 (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 5
and Table 1). The specific genes differed substantially across tumour
types, although some pairs of tumour types showed clear similarity,
such as lung squamous cancer and head and neck squamous cancer
(Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6).
Notably, only 22 genes were found to be significant in three or more
tumour types. The well-established cancer genes TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN,
RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, CDKN2A, FBXW7, ARID1A and MLL2, as
well as STAG2, were significant in four or more tumour types. An addi-
tional 10 genes (ATM, CASP8, CTCF, ERBB3, HLA-A, HRAS, IDH1,
NF1, NFE2L2 and PIK3R1) were significant in three tumour types.
Althoughthepower todetectcancer genesvariedacrosstumourtypes
(based on samplesize and background mutation frequency),the marked
differences across tumour types do not simply reflect differences in
detection power. For example, tumour types with low mutation fre-
quency or many samples often show fewer cancer genes despite having
greater statistical power to detect them (Table 1). Moreover, many
genes that are highly enriched in one (for example, VHL, WT1) or a
few (for example, HRAS, FBXW7) tumour types fail to show detectable
enrichmentacrosstheentiredataset(SupplementaryTable2).Notably,
most of the significant gene3 tumour-type pairs involve only a small
fraction of patients (with one half of the significant pairs invol-
ving#6.1% of patients, and one quarter involving #3.1%).
We then analysedthecombinedset,which produced114 genes (Fig.3
and Supplementary Table 2). Although 84 of these genes were already
identified from analysis of individual tumour types, the remaining 30
achieved significance based only on the frequency of mutations across
tumour types, underscoring the value of cross-tumour-type analysis.
Conversely, 140 of the 224 genes found in analysis of individual tumour
types didnotreach significance when analysing the combined set (Fig. 3,
bottom-right quadrant), consistent with the observation that many
genes show strong enrichment in only one or a few tumour types.
By merging the 22 lists above, we obtained a Cancer5000 set con-
taining 254 genes. Although the expected proportion of false positive
genes in each list does not exceed 10%, the expected proportion in the
merged list is actually higher (because true positives will tend to occur

singletons). A rigorous solution is to analyse the gene3 tumour-type
pairs as approximately 400,000 distinct hypotheses (approximately
18,400 genes 3 22 types) and apply an FDR of q # 0.1. This analysis
produces 403 significant pairs, which involve 219 distinct genes. We
refer to this set as the Cancer5000-S (for ‘stringent’) genes. (All but six
ofthegenesarecontainedintheCancer5000set.)Ofthe403significant
pairs,10%(approximately40)atmost are expectedtobefalsepositives.
Assuming conservatively that the 40 pairs affect 40 distinct genes, we
expect 179 of the 219 genes to be true cancer genes. Below, we discuss
genes from both the Cancer5000 and Cancer5000-S sets.
Coverage of known cancer genes
We first asked whether all cancer genes that have been discovered and
validated to date can be identified by hypothesis-free genomic analysis.
As a reference set, we used the Cancer Gene Census (CGC), which is a
manually curated catalogue of cancer genes. The current version (v65)
contains 130 cancer genes driven by somatic point mutations (as well
as additional genes mutated by other mechanisms), of which 82 are
associated with 1 or more of the 21 tumour types studied here.
Of these 82 genes, 60 were identified in our Cancer5000 set. Of the
remaining 22 genes, 8 fell just below significance in our data set, 6
appear in the CGC based on focused studies of the gene in very large
samples (typically .1,000), and 8 genes harboured few mutations and
seem to lack adequate evidence to justify association with any of the
tumour types we studied. The first two categories would clearly be
captured with larger sample sizes.
Analysis of novel candidate cancer genes
Of the 219 genes in the Cancer5000-S set, 81 are neither listed in the
CGC as affected by point mutations in these tumour types (v65) nor
discussed in papers published so far (Supplementary Table 4). (The
list includes three genes that appear in tables in published papers
based on mutations in a handful of samples, but were not noted or
interpreted in the text.) Of the 41 additional genes in the Cancer5000
(but not Cancer5000-S) set, none are in the CGC but 3 are reported in
recent publications (Supplementary Table 4).
We closely analysed these 81 ‘novel’ genes to look for connections
with cancer biology, together with a mutational pattern consistent with
the biology. Where loss-of-function would be expected, we looked for
an excessof disruptivechanges, suchasnonsense and frameshift muta-
tions. In cases in which gain-of-function would be expected, we exam-
ined whether the overall collection of mutations included hotspots that
resulted in recurrent changes at identical or nearby amino acids (often
causing precisely the same change). Conversely, where we observed
distinctive mutation patterns, we examined whether they were consist-
ent with known biology.
As discussed above, the Cancer5000-S set is expected by design to
contain approximately 40 false positives. Assuming conservatively
that these false positives fall exclusively in the novel set, we expect
approximately 41 of the 81 novel genes to be true positives.
In fact, we identified strong and consistent connections to cancer
for at least 21 of the novel genes in the Cancer5000-S set. Among the
38 additional novel genes in the larger Cancer5000 set, we found 12
additional strong candidates. (References supporting the biological

roles of the genes are provided in Supplementary Table 5.) We briefly
describe below these 33 genes not previously reported as significantly
mutated in cancer.
Four genes encode anti-proliferative proteins, in which loss-of-
function mutations would be expected to contribute to oncogenesis.
A notable example is ARHGAP35 (previously called GRLF1), which
encodes a Rho-GTPase-activating protein, for which only a single
tumour type reaches statistical significance on its own, but which gives
a strong signal (q 5 2 310212) in the combined set of 4,742 tumours
(83missense, 38 nonsense, 16 frameshift and 2 splice site).Notably, the
gene resides in a small genomic region that is focally deleted in many
tumours. Other examples are MGA, whose product competes with
Myc for binding to Max and which resides in small focal deletions
(containing #4 genes) in ovarian and various epithelial cancers; the
interferon regulatory factor IRF6, which is known to have tumour
suppressive roles in keratinocytes and is mutated in head and neck
squamous cancer; and the delta/notch-like EGF-repeat gene DNER.
Six additional genes encode proteins that are clearly involved in cell
proliferation: RHEB, RHOA, SOS1, ELF3, SGK1 and MYOCD. Notably,
RHEB and RHOA encode small GTPases, in which recurrent mutations
affect the 9-amino-acid effector domain. For RHEB, five tumours (two
endometrial and three kidney clear cell cancer) carry Tyr35Asn muta-
tions,whichalterthefirstaminoacidoftheeffectordomain.ForRHOA,
seven tumours(sixheadand neck, one breast)carrymutationsaffecting
the effector domain: these include six Glu40Gln mutations and a single
Tyr42Ile mutation, which alter the seventh and ninth amino acids of
the effector domain, respectively. SOS1 encodes a guanine nucleotide
exchange factor that promotes activation of Ras proteins, in which
gain-of-function mutations might contribute to oncogenesis. Consistent
with this notion, SOS1 carries Asn233Tyr mutations in six tumours
(four endometrial and two lung adenocarcinoma) and Arg 552 altera-
tions in three tumours (two endometrial and one AML). Notably, the
same Arg 522 alterations in SOS1 have been found to be germline muta-
tions causing Noonan syndrome and to cause gain of function, resulting
in Ras activation. ELF3 encodes an ETS-domain transcription factor
that functions in cell differentiation; it carries many truncating muta-
tionsinbladderandcoloncancer.Myocardin(MYOCD),whichencodes
a transcriptional regulator involved in differentiation and cell migration,
has a cluster of 9 mutations at amino acids 750–770 (7 in melanoma, 1
headandneck,1lungadenocarcinoma)witha hotspotoffouratSer 763.
The retinoid X receptor alpha RXRA, which forms a heterodimer with
retinoic acid receptors to regulate cell growth and survival, shows a
clear hotspot of recurrent mutations at Ser 427 in bladder cancer and
nearby mutations in lung, head and neck, and oesophageal cancers.
Five genes encode pro-apoptotic factors, in which loss-of-function
mutations would be expected to promote oncogenesis. These genes
encode alpha-kinase 2 (ALPK2); Bcl2-associated factor 1 (BCLAF1); a
MAP kinase (MAP4K3) reported to post-transcriptionally regulate the
apoptotic proteins PUMA (also known as BBC3), BAD and BIM (also
known as BCL2L11); a zinc-finger protein (ZNF750, which harbours
manyearly frameshift and nonsense mutations inhead and neckcancer
and is the only known gene residing in a small current focal deletion in
headand neckand lungsquamouscancers);and tumour necrosis factor
(TNF, which harbours mutations in five diffuse large B-cell lymphomas
that are tightly clustered in the region encoding the membrane and
cytoplasmic domain, rather than the soluble TNF protein).
Six genes encode proteins related to genome stability. These include
CEP76 (encoding a centrosomal protein, whose depletion drives aber-
rant amplification of centrioles), which harbours early nonsense muta-
tions in many tumour types and resides in a focal deletion peak in acute
myeloidleukaemia;RAD21(encodingaproteincrucialforchromosome
segregation and double-strand break repair), which is mutated at sig-
nificant rates in acute myeloid leukaemia and also harbours mutations
in other tumour types; the p53-binding protein TP53BP1 (encoding a
check-pointprotein that binds todouble-strand breaks), which does not
reach significance in any single tumour type, but is significant in the
combined data set owing to truncating mutations in many tumour
types; TPX2 (encoding a protein involved in mitotic spindle formation,
whosedepletionleadstoaneuploidy);andZRANB3(encodingatranslo-
case that helps to rescue stalled replication forks). In addition, STX2
encodes a protein required for cytokinesis, whose disruption may pro-
moteaneuploidy;STX2harboursrecurrentmutationsatArg 107inlung
and endometrial tumours.
Fivegenesareassociatedwithchromatinregulation.SETDB1encodes
a H3K9 histone methyltransferase (SETD2, which encodes a H3K36
histone methyltransferase, has been shown previously to be mutated
in cancer). MBD1 encodes a protein that binds methylated-CpG and
is required for SETDB1 activity; it contains five mutations in endomet-
rialcancerintheamino-terminalmethyl-bindingdomain.EZH1encodes
a H3K27 histone methyltransferase; it does not reach significance in
any individual tumour type, but is significant in the combined set
owing to truncating mutations in multiple tumour types. EZH1 shows
a similar pattern of mutations as seen in the well-established cancer
gene EZH2, with truncating mutations along the gene and a hotspot of

mutations within the SET domain. CHD8 encodes a chromatin heli-
case DNA binding protein (like the known cancer gene CHD4) that
suppressesthe b-catenin–Wnt signalling pathway. The histone protein
HIST1H4E is mutated in multiple tumour types; two other histone
genes, HIST1H1E and HIST1H3B, have previously been reported as
significantly mutated in CLL and DLBCL, respectively.
Three genes encode proteins whose loss is expected to help tumours
evade immune attack; they all recurrently subject to truncating muta-
tions across several tumour types. These include the major histocom-
patibility protein HLA-B (loss of the HLA-A gene has been implicated
in lung cancer), TAP1 (which processes intracellular peptides for
presentation to the immune system) and CD1D (which presents lipid
antigens to natural killer cells), the last of which shows a cluster of
truncating mutations at the internalization domain that are likely to
abolish antigen-presentation function.
Three genes are associated with RNA processing and metabolism.
PCBP1, whose protein product blocks translation of certain mRNAs
by binding to poly(C) regions of messenger RNAs, carries two muta-
tions in each of two nearby leucines (Leu 100 and Leu 102) that medi-
ate dimerization of the protein’s K-homology domains. We speculate
that disruption of PCBP1 leads to increased translation of one or more
pro-oncogenic mRNAs. QKI encodes an RNA-binding protein that
regulates pre-mRNA splicing, including the known cancer gene
CDKN1B; the gene harbours caboxy-terminal truncating mutations
in several tumour types that are likely to remove the nuclear local-
ization signal; and the gene resides in a recurrent deletion peak in
glioblastoma and ovarian cancer. Finally, the ribosomal protein gene
RPL5 contains early truncating mutations in glioblastoma and other
tumour types and resides in a focally deleted region in glioblastoma;
heterozygous loss of certain ribosomal proteins has been reported to
contribute to cancer.
One gene, TRIM23, is involved in protein homeostasis. It encodes
an ubiquitin E3 ligase and harbours recurrent mutations at Asn 93
(four tumours) and Asp 289 (three tumours). Mutations in this gene
may promote cancer by altering the substrate specificity of the E3
ligase in a manner that leads to accumulation of an oncogenic protein.
Beyond these 33 genes, the set of 81 novel genes is likely to contain
additional true cancer genes. For example, we omitted genes with
connections to cancer (such as HSP90AB1, PPM1D and ITGB7) in
situations in which we could not easily reconcile the function in
cancer with the observed pattern of mutations. In addition, we may
have overlooked additional candidate cancer genes because we did not
identify clear connections with cancer, owing to gaps in the literature
or in our knowledge.
Saturation analysis
We next explored whether the discovery of candidate cancer genes is
approaching saturation or whether many more genes are likely to be
found. An effective test is to perform ‘down-sampling’; that is, to study
how the number of discoveries increases with sample size, by repeat-
ing the analysis on random subsets of samples of various smaller sizes.
For each tumour type (omitting those with five or fewer candidate
cancer genes), the number of genes increases roughly linearly with
sample size (examples in Fig. 4a; see also Supplementary Fig. 7),
indicating that the inventory for each of the tumour types is far from
complete. The number of genes also increases linearly with the num-
ber of tumour types studied (Fig. 4b), suggesting that it is valuable to
increase both the sample size per tumour type and the number of
tumour types.
Wealso studied howthetotal number of candidate cancer genes varies
with sample size when applying the ‘stringent’ methodology used to
createtheCancer5000-Sset.Heretoo,thetotalnumberofgenesincreases
steadily with sample size (Fig. 4c). Notably, the saturation analysis varies
considerably with the mutation frequency (Fig. 4d). Genes mutated in
.20% of tumours are approaching saturation; those mutated at frequen-
cies of 10–20% are still rising rapidly, but at a decreasing rate; those at
5–10% are increasing linearly; and those at ,5% are increasingly at an
accelerating rate.
We next sought to infer the nature of the genes awaiting discovery
in each tumour type. One possibility is that some of these genes are
already contained in the Cancer5000 set (by virtue of their contri-
bution to other tumour types) but have not yet reached statistical
significance in the given tumour type due to insufficient sample size.
To test this idea, we performed restricted hypothesis testing (RHT):
for each tumour type T, we omitted that tumour type, determined the
set of genes (GT) that are significant based on the remaining tumour

types, and determined which genes in GT reached significance in the
omitted tumour type when correcting for multiple-hypothesis testing
based on only the number of genes in GT rather than all (approxi-
mately 18,400) genes in the genome.
The RHT analysis implicated many additional Cancer5000 genes in
the individual tumour types (median 6 per tumour type, range 0–15).
The number of significant gene 3 tumour-type pairs increased from
334 to 461 across the 21 tumour types. The RHT analysis indicates
that, with somewhat larger sample size, these genes are likely to reach
significanceinanunrestrictedtest(Table1andSupplementaryTable3).
For some tumour types, the number of implicated genes more than
doubled: lung squamous cell carcinoma increased from 11 to 24; CLL
from7to15;andovarianfrom5to10.Notably,threegenesnowbecame
significantinfourtumour types each(ARID2,ERBB2,ARHGAP35) and
seven genes in three types each (CTNNB1, FGFR3, KRAS, PTEN,
SMAD4, MLL3). Although nine of these genes are well known cancer
genes, one (ARHGAP35) is absent from the current CGC list. Notably,
ARHGAP35 appears in the Cancer5000 set because it is significantly
mutated in endometrial cancer (although not discussed in the recent
TCGA publication9), but our RHT analysis also finds it to be significant
in lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, kidney clear
cell, and head and neck cancer. The genes found to be significant in
additional tumour types in the RHT analysis are mutated at a median
frequency of 3.4%.
However, the data alsoclearly show that many newcandidatecancer
genes remain to be discovered beyond those in the current Cancer5000
set. First, in addition to the Cancer5000 genes being shown by RHT to
be significant in additional tumour types, the down-sampling analysis
shows that the number of novel genes being identified is increasing
sharply (using the stringent analysis used to create the Cancer5000-S
set). Second, adding additional tumour types typically adds novel
‘tumour-type-specific’ genes, which are unique to (or at vastly higher
frequency in) the tumour type.
Power analysis
As the cancer-gene catalogue remains far from complete, we explored
what sample sizes are needed to approach saturation. The power to
detect a gene as significantly mutated depends on the properties of the
tumour type, namely the average background somatic mutation fre-
quency along the genome for the tumour type (‘noise’), and the target
frequency (across patients)—above the background rate—that one
wishes to detect (‘signal’). It also depends on the properties of the gene,
namely its background mutation frequency relative to other genes
(which depends on length and local mutation rate). We set a target
of having 90% power to detect 90% of all genes. In addition, we allow
for a false negative rate of 10% in detecting mutations, which increases
the sample size by slightly more than 10%.
Figure 5 shows that the current collection lacks the desired power to
detect genes mutated at 5% above the background rate for 17 of the 21
tumour types and even at 10% for 7 of the tumour types. These results
are consistent with the down-sampling analysis showing that candid-
ate cancer genes with frequency $20% are approaching saturation,
whereas the number of candidate cancer genes at lower frequencies is
continuing to grow rapidly with sample size.
Creating a reasonably comprehensive catalogue of candidate can-
cer genes mutated in $2% of patients will require between approxi-
mately 650 samples (for tumours with ,0.5 mutations per Mb, such
as neuroblastoma) to approximately 5,300 samples (for melanoma,
with 12.9 mutations per Mb).
Discussion
Precision medicine for cancer will ultimately require a comprehensive
catalogue of cancer genes to enable physicians to select the best com-
bination therapy for each patient based on the cellular pathways dis-
rupted in their tumour and the specific nature of the disruptions. Such a
catalogue will also guide therapeutic development by identifying drug-
gable targets. In addition, the catalogue and its underlying data will
facilitate the interpretation of cell lines, animal models and clinical
observations and will reveal patterns of co-occurrence, mutual exclus-
ivity and lineage restriction, which may provide mechanistic insights
with profound therapeutic implications.
Although a handful of cancer genes are mutated at high frequency,
most cancer genes mutated in most patients occur at intermediate
frequencies (2–20%). To provide therapeutic options for most patients,
it will therefore be critical to identify and understand the pathway-level
implications of all genes mutated at intermediate frequencies (2–20%).
With growing data sets across many tumour types, pan-cancer ana-
lyses are becoming of great interest10,11. In this paper,westudied somatic
point mutations in a collection of nearly 5,000 tumour-normal pairs
across 21 cancer types. We identified a Cancer5000 set containing 254
genes, based on merging results from each tumour type and the com-
bined set, and a stringent Cancer5000-S set containing 219 genes,
accounting for multiple-hypothesis testing across the types. Nearly all
previously known cancer genes in these tumour types are contained
within these sets or just below statistical significance.
After eliminating genes reported in the CGC or recent papers and
accounting for the expected number of false positives, the stringent
Cancer5000-S set is expected to contain approximately 41 novel can-
didate cancer genes, with additional candidate cancer genes expected
in the larger Cancer5000 set. After close inspection, we found 33 genes
(21 in the stringent set and 12 more in the larger set) with strong
functional connections to cancer and mutation patterns consistent
with the presumed function. These genes fall within known ‘hallmarks’
of cancer3,12, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability,
chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA processing and protein
homeostasis. Follow-up studies will be required to confirm and under-
stand the functional impact of the mutations in these genes.
Beyond identifying new candidate cancer genes, our study demon-
strates that we are far from having a complete catalogue of cancer genes,
with many genes at clinically important frequencies within individual
tumour types and across cancer as a whole still awaiting identification.
The number of such genes is still increasing steeply with the number of
samples and the number of tumour types studied. Importantly, these
new candidate cancer genes are not rare. Substantial ongoing increases
are seen in each of the 10–20%, 5–10% and 2–5% ranges (Fig. 4d).

Notably,ofthe33novelgenesabove,5aremutatedatfrequenciesgreater
than 10% and fifteen at frequencies greater than 5%.
Creating a comprehensive catalogue of genes in which somatic
point mutations propel cancer at both high (.20%) and intermediate
(2–20%) frequency will require analysing an average of approximately
2,000 tumours for each of at least 50 tumour types, corresponding
to approximately 100,000 tumours. (Currently defined tumour types
may be divided, based on genomic information, into distinct subtypes,
each of which should be analysed on its own. The ultimate number of
tumour types will thus be defined iteratively by molecular analysis.)
Analysis should include both point mutations (as studied here), as
well as other types of functional variation7. Genomic studies of such
large numbers of samples is no longer prohibitive, in light of the one-
million-fold decrease in the cost of DNA sequencing over the past
decade. Given the devastating toll of cancer, with nearly 8 million
deaths annually worldwide13, completing the genomic analysis of this
disease should be a biomedical imperative.
METHODS SUMMARY
For TCGA tumour types, mutation data were downloaded from the Synapse
website. For non-TCGA tumour types, sequencing data was downloaded from
dbGaP and processed through Firehose, the Broad Institute’s analysis pipeline.
Liftover was used to convert hg18 data. Each mutation in the combined MAF file
was filtered against a panel of normal samples. Three significance metrics were
calculated for each gene, using the previously described methods MutSigCV,
MutSigCL, and MutSigFN. These measure the significance, respectively, of muta-
tion burden, clustering, and functional impact. The three MutSig tests were
combined into a single final P value for each gene, and q values were calculated
using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg, and genes with q # 0.1 were
declared to be candidate cancer genes. Down-sampling was performed within
each tumour type and for the combined data set. MutSig analysis was repeated for
a set of many smaller random subsets of patients. Genes were stratified by their
maximal frequency across tumour types (Fig. 4d). Power analysis was performed
usinga binomialpower model.We first calculated the probability, p0, that a patient
will have at least onenon-silent mutation in a particular gene from the background
model. We then calculated the signal we want to detect, p1 5 p0 1 r(12m), where r
is the frequency of non-silent mutations in the population (above background)
that a gene is mutated and m is the mis-detection rate of the mutation (we took
m 5 0.1). The power was then calculated using a binomial model, with p 5 p0
representing the null hypothesis, and p 5 p1 representing the alternative hypo-
thesis (Methods). To obtain Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 9 we found the number
of tumour–normal pairs that yielded 90% power for 90% of genes as a function of
background mutation frequency and r.

METHODS
Mutation data and preprocessing. Mutation data were obtained as follows. For
TCGA tumour types, mutation data were downloaded from the Synapse website
(http://www.synapse.org),accessionno.syn1729383.Fornon-TCGAtumourtypes,
sequencing data was downloaded from dbGaP and processed through Firehose,
the Broad Institute’s analysis platform (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/
Firehose). For tumour types that were originally aligned to build hg18, LiftOver
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver)wasusedtoconvertthecoordinatesof
each mutation to build hg19. All mutation data were then combined into a single
MAFfile.Duplicatepatientsandduplicatemutationswereremoved.Tostandardize
the definition of a ‘splice-site’ mutation, any mutation affecting the two bases before
or after a splice junction, was labelled as a splice-site mutation. Filtering was per-
formed as follows. To remove common sequencing artefacts or residual germline
variation, each mutation in the combined MAF file was subjected to a ‘Panel of
Normals’ filtering process using a panel of over 4000 BAM files from normal
samples. For each mutation, the position of the mutation was examined in each
normal BAM file. Mutations observed in the panel of normals were removed from
the MAF. The final MAF is available at http://www.tumorportal.org/.
MutSig significance calculations. Three significance metrics were calculated for
each gene, using the previously described methods MutSigCV, MutSigCL, and
MutSigFN. These measure the significance of mutation burden, clustering, and
functional impact, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3). MutSigCV was described
previously6. MutSigCV determines the P value for observing the given quantity of
non-silent mutations in the gene, given the background model determined by
silent (and noncoding) mutations in the same gene and the neighbouring genes of
covariate space that form its ‘bagel’. MutSigCL and MutSigFN were used prev-
iously8 but were not given names in that work. Here we name the methods to
reflect the type of evidence of positive selection that they are designed to detect.
MutSigCL and MutSigFN measure the significance of the positional clustering of
the mutations observed, as well as the significance of the tendency for mutations
to occur at positions that are highly evolutionarily conserved (using conservation
as a proxy for probably functional impact). MutSigCL and MutSigFN are permuta-
tion-based methods and their P values are calculated as follows: The observed
nonsilent coding mutations in the gene are permuted T times (to simulate the null
hypothesis, T 5 108 for the most significant genes), randomly reassigning their
positions, but preserving their mutational ‘category’, as determined by local
sequence context. We used the following context categories: transitions at CpG
dinucleotides, transitions at other C–G base pairs, transversions at C–G base pairs,
mutations at A–T base pairs, and indels. Indels are unconstrained in terms ofwhere
they can move to in the permutations. For each of the random permutations, two
scores are calculated: SCLand SFN, measuringthe amount ofclustering and function
impact (measured by conservation) respectively. SCL is defined to be the fraction of
mutations occurring in hotspots. A hotspot is defined as a 3-base-pair region of the
gene containing many mutations: at least 2, and at least 2% of the total mutations.
SFN is defined to be the mean of the base-pair-level conservation values for the
position of each non-silent mutation, as obtained from an alignment of 45 verte-
brate genomes to the human genome, the UCSC ‘phyloP46way’ track, which can be
downloadedfrom(http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/phyloP46way
/README.txt).TodetermineaPCL,thePvaluefortheobserveddegreeofpositional
clustering,theobservedvalueofSCL(computedforthemutationsactuallyobserved),
was compared to the distribution of SCL obtained from the random permutations,
and the P value was defined to be the fraction of random permutations in which SCL
was at least as large as the observed SCL. The P value for the conservation of the
mutated positions, PFN, was computed analogously. Finally, we noted that the gene
AJUBA was referred to in some analyses by the alternative name JUB; after recon-
ciling this naming difference, the gene was significant and added to the list of
significant genes.
Combining MutSig statistics. The three MutSig tests described above (MutSigCV,
MutSigCL and MutSigFN) were combined into a single final P value as follows.
First, a joint P value (CL 1 FN) for the observed clustering and conservation was
calculated from the joint probability distribution of the random permutations.
Next, this was combined with the MutSigCV P value using two methods: the
Fisher method of combining P values from independent tests (http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Fisher’s_method); the truncated product method (TPM) for combining P
values, which rewards highly significant P values in any one of the tests The com-
bined P values for both methods were extremely similar. We examined the per-
formance of each of the three metrics separately and each pairwise combination of
two metrics. The results of these analyses are presented in Supplementary Table 1
(last tab) and summarized in Supplementary Table 5.
Multiple hypothesis corrections. In the analysis of each tumour type, a total of
18,388 genes were analysed. To correct for these multiple hypotheses, the final
MutSig P values were converted to FDR (q values) using the method of Benjamini
and Hochberg, and genes with q # 0.1 were declared to be significantly mutated.
This was also done for the analysis of the combined cohort. Genes with q # 0.1 in
any tumour-type analysis or in the combined-cohort analysis were declared to be
a member of the Cancer5000 list of candidate cancer genes.
To correct for the 22 analyses thus combined (corresponding to 22 chances for
each gene to become significant), a further level of multiple hypothesis correction
was applied. A list was made of the 18,388 genes 3 22 analyses 5 404,536 hypo-
theses. The Benjamini–Hochberg method was applied to this full set, yielding new
FDR q values. Any gene involved in these gene 3 tumour-type pairs was declared
to be a member of the stringently corrected Cancer5000-S list of genes.
Down-sampling analyses. To analyse the dependence of the number of signifi-
cantly mutated cancer-associated genes upon the size of the data set being ana-
lysed, down-sampling was performed. Three different down-sampling analyses
are described: first, down-sampling within each tumour type; second, down-
sampling of the number of different tumour types; and third, down-sampling
of the full Cancer5000-S procedure.
Down-sampling within each tumour type (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 7): for
eachtumourtype,theMutSiganalysiswasrepeatedforasetofmanysmallersubsets
of patients from that tumour type. The sizes of the subsets were chosen to sample
regularly the interval from zero patients to the final total number of patients that
were in the full analysis. For each of the random subsets thus defined, we repeated
the full MutSig calculation (MutSigCV 1 MutSigCL 1 MutSigFN) and combined
the results of the three tests as described above. This enabled us to determine which
genes remained significant when analysing each smaller subset. We counted how
many of the genes remained significant at each smaller set size, and plotted this
number as a smoothed function of set size. This allowed us to demonstrate that the
number of significantly mutated genes detected is continuing to rise steeply in each
tumour type. We also repeated this same analysis for the full combined data set
(4,742 patients), with similar results.
Down-sampling of the number of different tumour types (Fig. 4b). To examine
the effect of adding whole tumour types, we performed the following analysis. We
constructed 25 random orderings of the 21 tumour types, and for each ordering
we constructed 20 subsets by sequentially adding whole tumour types according
to that ordering. Then we repeated the whole MutSig analysis for each of these
subsets. This produced a set of curves showing how the number of significantly
mutated genes increased as a function of the number of tumour types included in
the analysis. The curve depended on the exact ordering of the tumour types as
they were added, but all curves showed a steady increase in the number of genes,
even at the highest numbers of tumour types. This demonstrated the importance
of continuing to sample additional tumour types. We also repeated the analysis
with subtraction ofthe expectednumberof false positives (SupplementaryFig. 8a);
the results were qualitatively unchanged.
Down-sampling of the full Cancer5000-S procedure (Fig. 4c): we repeated our
procedure of constructing the Cancer5000-S list by applying the stringent pro-
cedure of correction for the approximately 400,000 hypothesis (18,388 genes
3 22 analyses), and computed how many genes remained significant at each
smaller set size. We plotted the number of significantly mutated genes detected
as a function of set size. This produced a curve similar to down-sampling within
each tumour type, with the number of significant genes continuing to rise steeply
even at the largest set sizes. We also repeated the analysis with subtraction of the
expected number of false positives (Supplementary Fig. 8b); the results were
qualitatively unchanged. Furthermore, we stratified the genes according to their
frequency (calculated as the maximal frequency across tumour types), and plotted
separate curves for each of the following frequency categories: 20% and above,
10–20%, 5–10%, 3–5%, 2–3%, and below 2%. This clearly demonstrated that the
20% and above genes have largely been discovered. In contrast, genes at lower
frequencies are continuing to be discovered (Fig. 4d). Note that rerunning the
analysis produces slightly different results in every run since the calculation of P
values has a stochastic component. The genes at the edge of significance (that is,
ones with q value close to 0.1) may be declared as significant or insignificant with
respect to the cut-off of q 5 0.1 in different analyses. This slight fluctuation is
standard for permutation-based methods.
Power calculations. Power analysis was performed using a binomial power
model. We first calculated the probability, p0, that a patient will have at least
one non-silent mutation in a particular gene from the background model. The
calculation is based on the length of the gene, L (in coding bases), the background
mutation frequency, m (in mutations per base), the gene-specific mutation rate
factor, fg, (calculated by MutSigCV), the 3:1 typical ratio of non-silent to silent
mutations; p0 5 1 2 (1 2 mfg)(3L/4). We used L 5 1,500, and fg 5 3.9 (representing
the 90th percentile of fg Lg/1,500 across the approximately 18,000 genes and fg 5 1
for the 50th percentile gene). We then calculated the signal we want to detect,
p1 5 p0 1 r(1 2 m), where r is the frequency of non-silent mutations in the
population (above background) that a gene is mutated and m is the mis-detection
rate of the mutation (we took m 5 0.1). The power was then calculated by: first,

using a binomial of N trials (that is, N patients) and p 5 p0, finding the minimal
number of patients with mutations that reach a genome-wide significance level
(P # 531026); and second, calculating the power as the probability of observing
at least this many patients with mutations when using a binomial with p 5 p1. To
obtain Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 9 we found the values of N that yielded 90%
power as a function of m and r.
