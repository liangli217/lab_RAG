Determining the genetic basis of cancer requires comprehensive analyses of large collections of histopathologically
well-classified primary tumours. Here we report the results of a collaborative study to discover somatic mutations in 188
human lung adenocarcinomas. DNA sequencing of 623 genes with known or potential relationships to cancer revealed more
than 1,000 somatic mutations across the samples. Our analysis identified 26 genes that are mutated at significantly high
frequencies and thus are probably involved in carcinogenesis. The frequently mutated genes include tyrosine kinases, among
them the EGFR homologue ERBB4; multiple ephrin receptor genes, notably EPHA3; vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor KDR; and NTRK genes. These data provide evidence of somatic mutations in primary lung adenocarcinoma for
several tumour suppressor genes involved in other cancers—including NF1, APC, RB1 and ATM—and for sequence changes in
PTPRD as well as the frequently deleted gene LRP1B. The observed mutational profiles correlate with clinical features,
smoking status and DNA repair defects. These results are reinforced by data integration including single nucleotide
polymorphism array and gene expression array. Our findings shed further light on several important signalling pathways
involved in lung adenocarcinoma, and suggest new molecular targets for treatment.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, annually resulting in
more than one million deaths worldwide. About 1.2 million new cases
are diagnosed each year1 and prognoses are poor. Lung adenocarci-
noma is the most common form of lung cancer and has an average
5-yr survival rate of 15%2, mainly because of late-stage detection and a
paucity of late-stage treatments.
Althoughsmoking isunquestionably theleadingcauseoflungcancer,
approximately 10% of cases occur in patients who have never smoked3.

Previous gene resequencing efforts have identified several key
mutations associated with human cancers15–18. The Tumour
Sequencing Project (TSP) is a pilot project to characterize cancer
genomes, and has allowed the discovery of somatic mutations in
the coding exons of 623 candidate cancer genes in 188 lung adeno-
carcinomas. Here we identify significantly mutated genes not pre-
viously associated with lung adenocarcinoma, describe relationships
between different genetic alterations, and report correlations
between genetic alterations and clinical features. Moreover, our
integration of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, gene
expression array and mutation data provides a broader view of geno-
mic alterations in lung adenocarcinomas. These findings further our
understanding of lung cancer and provide clues to new therapeutic
targets.
Overview of samples, genes and mutations discovered
We selected 188 primary lung adenocarcinomas, each containing a
minimum of 70% tumour cells as determined by study pathologists.
Wescreenedforsomaticmutationsin623candidategenescomprising
known oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, protein kinase fam-
ilies, and genes in regions of copy number alteration, focusing on
coding exons and splice sites (Supplementary Table 1). A total of
247 megabases of tumour DNA sequence was analysed to identify
putative mutations, and non-synonymous mutations were validated
by orthogonal methods or confirmed by independent polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing (Supplementary
Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1).
We have identified 1,013 non-synonymous somatic mutations in
163 of the 188 tumours, including 915 point mutations, 12 dinucleo-
tide mutations (mutations affecting two consecutive bases on the
same allele), 29 insertions and 57 deletions, with insertions/deletions
(indels) ranging from 1 to 23 nucleotides. The point mutations
include 802 missense, 75 nonsense, 1 read-through and 37 splice-site
mutations (Supplementary Table 2).
A set of 12 genes was found with significantly higher frequencies of
nonsense, splice-site and frameshift mutations (P , 0.1), suggesting
that they were candidate tumour suppressor genes (Supplementary
Table 3a). Recurrent somatic mutations were observed at 28 sites
across seven genes; these included five previously unknown sites in five
genes (Supplementary Table 3b). In silico predictions suggest that 580
of the missense mutations have potential functional relevance. A com-
parison of the mutations to the COSMIC19 and OMIM20 databases
identified 823 somatic mutations and 818 mutation sites that were
not present in these databases, respectively (Supplementary Methods
and Supplementary Table 2).
Significantly mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma
The large size of our sample set enabled the identification of mutated
genes that show evidence for positive selection in lung adenocarci-
noma. We used three different methods (Supplementary Methods
and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5) to determine the significance of
the difference between theobserved versus expected numbers ofmuta-
tions in 188 tumours. We identified a total of 26 significantly mutated
genes, among them 17 genes are designated as significant by at least
two approaches (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 6a). Note that
LRP1B, despite its large number of mutations, was found to be signifi-
cant by only one method, mostly owing to its long coding sequence.
The study identified many genes previously known to be mutated
in lung adenocarcinoma, including several tumour suppressor genes
(TP53 (ref. 21), CDKN2A (ref. 22) and STK11 (ref. 23)) and onco-
genes (KRAS24, EGFR8 and NRAS25). In addition, we found several
new genes that were significantly mutated in this disease.
Bona fide and putative tumour suppressor genes. The most prom-
inent case for a tumour suppressor gene is NF1, for which inactiv-
ating mutations are found in neurofibromatosis type I patients26. In
this study, 16 NF1 mutations (4 nonsense, 5 splice-site and 1 frame-
shift mutations) were identified in 13 patients (Supplementary Table
2). Three tumours harboured two mutations each, although it is not
known whether these mutations are in cis or in trans. This suggests
potential bi-allelic inactivation of NF1 in these three patients.
Another previously unknown mutated tumour suppressor gene in
lung adenocarcinoma is ATM, encoding a cell-cycle checkpoint
kinase that functions as a regulator of p53 (ref. 27). Genetic poly-
morphisms of ATM are known to affect lung cancer risk28, but only
isolated instances of ATM somatic mutation have been reported in
lung adenocarcinoma15. We found 14 ATM mutations in 13
tumours, including 1 nonsense, 1 splice-site and 2 frameshift muta-
tions (Supplementary Table 2).
Another tumour suppressor gene harbouring frequent mutations
is RB1, which was first identified as the susceptibility gene for retino-
blastoma29. Given that DNA tumour viruses such as papillomaviruses
typically target RB1 and TP53 simultaneously30, it is interesting to
note that five of the seven RB1 mutations occur in tumours with TP53
mutations, and two occur in tumours with ATM mutations, suggest-
ing that an ATM mutation may substitute functionally for a TP53
mutation.
APC mutations have been reported in lung squamous cell carcin-
oma and small-cell lung carcinoma31, but not in lung adenocarci-
noma. We observed 13 mutations in 11 tumours confirmed by
pathology evaluation to be lung tumour samples and not metastatic
colorectal carcinomas. Mutations (G34E and S37F) of the CTNNB1
gene were observed in two other tumours.
Deletion and epigenetic silencing of LRP1B have been previously
observed in lung cancer cell lines and oesophageal tumours32,33. Our
finding of 17 mutations in LRP1B further supports the notion that
LRP1B genomic alterations are significant in lung cancer pathogenesis
(Fig. 1). PTPRD, previously shown to be deleted in lung adenocarci-
noma34,35, is also found to be frequently mutated34. Owing to the
absence of nonsense, splice-site or frameshift mutations in both of
thesegenesinourtumourset,furtherevidenceisrequiredtodetermine
whether they are tumour suppressors or another category of genes.
Possible proto-oncogenes. Although the involvement of EGFR and
ERBB2 mutations in lung cancer has been reported previously, we
also found mutations at a significant frequency in ERBB4 (Fig. 1).
The discovery of nine mutations in ERBB4, two of which are puta-
tively deleterious with respect to the protein tyrosine kinase domain
and five of which are clustered in the receptor ligand binding domain,
indicates its involvement in lung cancer (Fig. 2). We also discovered
four mutations in ERBB2 and three in ERBB3.

The most significantly mutated gene in the ephrin family is EPHA3
(Fig. 1). Although isolated mutations in this gene have been
reported15,17, this is to our knowledge the first demonstration of stat-
istical significance of EPHA3 mutations in lung adenocarcinoma. The
11 mutations in EPHA3 are distributed along the length of the gene,
with 8 mutations in the extracellular domain and 3 in the kinase
domain, but no hotspot positions in which mutations cluster. One
observed mutation in EPHA3, K761N, is located in the kinase domain
at a highly conserved position analogous to FGFR2(K641)—part of a
newly described ‘‘molecular brake’’36. In total, we identified 37 muta-
tions in 10 of the 13 ephrin receptors sequenced, finding high muta-
tion rates in several family members (Figs 1 and 2).
Previous mutational screening of the tyrosine kinase domain of
NTRKs identified 9 mutations in 29 large-cell neuroendocrine carci-
nomas, but found no mutations in 443 non-small-cell lung cancers37.
In contrast we discovered 20 mutations in NTRKs (Fig. 1) of which 7
mutations occur within their tyrosine kinase domains, suggesting
that the role of NTRKs is not restricted to large-cell neuroendocrine
carcinomas. A significant number of mutations have also been iden-
tified in VEGFR and FGFR family members. In particular, four and
three kinase domain mutations were found in KDR and FGFR4 (ref.
38), respectively (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2).
Notably, several known oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes
fell below the borderline of significance in our study. These genes
include the proto-oncogenes AKT1 (in which we found two muta-
tions, including one (E17K) described as a transforming mutation in
other cancers39), CTNNB1, ERBB2 (ref. 40) and BRAF 41, as well as the
PTEN tumour suppressor gene42. These results offer enriched data for
investigating mutated functional domains (Supplementary Methods
and Supplementary Table 6b) and for analysing interactions among
mutations and pathways.
Concurrent and mutually exclusive mutations
We searched for correlations among mutations in 29 genes with at
least 6 mutations each. The strongest positive correlations were for
mutations in PIK3C3 and PTPRD, NTRK2 and PDGFRA, FGFR4 and

NTRK2, and FGFR4 and PDGFRA (P # 0.01; Supplementary
Table 7a, c). The well-known example of negative correlation of
mutations in EGFR and KRAS14 was confirmed in this study
(P , 1 3 10207), with no sample having mutations in both genes
(Fig. 3). We also found negative correlation between mutations in
EGFR and STK11 (P 5 7 3 10206), consistent with a previous
report43. Notably, samples with mutations in several receptor tyro-
sine kinase genes do not harbour any mutations in EGFR (Fig. 3). We
also detected a strong negative correlation between mutations in
ATM and TP53 (P 5 9.5 3 10205; Fig. 3), suggesting that mutations
in ATM and TP53 may be independently sufficient for the loss of cell-
cycle checkpoint control.
Distributions of mutations in individual cancer genomes
We studied the spectrum of mutations observed across tumours, in
relation to the overall mutation rate and to clinical phenotypes. We
found that mutations in TP53, PRKDC, SMG1 and a set of other
genes (Supplementary Table 8) are positively correlated with higher
mutation rates. Of particular interest, four of the six most highly
mutated tumours have mutations in PRKDC, which encodes a pro-
tein involved in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks44 (Fig. 4a).
The average of 24.3 mutations in tumours having PRKDC mutations
is significantly higher than the average of 4.7 mutations in tumours
without PRKDC mutations (P 5 3.52 3 10259).
We also determined that a set of genes including EGFR (P 5 0.05)
and PTEN (P 5 0.03) tended to be mutated in tumours with lower-
than-average mutation rates. Mutations in EGFR and PTEN may
have strong tumour-growth-promoting capability and thereby
reduce the selection pressure for acquiring further mutations.
Integration with copy number and gene expression data
Subsets of the TSP tumour collection were analysed using SNP array
(n 5 383), re-sequencing (n 5 188) and gene expression array
(n 5 75). All tumours used for sequencing and expression studies
have been analysed using SNP array. Significant correlation (false
discovery rate , 0.05) between copy number and expression level
in 75 tumours was observed, similar to the trend seen in a previous
study45 (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 9).
Comparison of mutation data with copy number analysis34 shows
that several significantly mutated genes are present in peaks of copy
number gain (EGFR and KRAS) or loss (CDKN2A, PTPRD and RB1).
Other amplified genes are subject to recurrent mutations (for example
ERBB2, MDM2 and TERT) although the mutation frequency does not
reach statistical significance. In parallel, several significantly mutated
genes show rare amplifications or deletions. The NRAS oncogene is
subject to rare amplification in lung adenocarcinoma(Supplementary
Fig. 4). The amplification of EPHA3 and KDR (Supplementary Figs 4
and 5) seen in two tumours each, indicates that these genes are pro-
bably proto-oncogenes. Conversely, we found NF1 to be homozy-
gously deleted in one tumour (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Furthermore, we found that mutations in PTEN, APC and TP53
were correlated with copy number loss (Supplementary Table 10a),
suggesting that these three genes might each undergo homozygous
loss of function. Conversely, mutations in EGFR, HCK, KRAS and
EPHB1 were associated with copy number gain (Supplementary
Table 10a), consistent with a proto-oncogene function. Notably,
three of the six tumours with the highest EGFR amplification also
have mutations in EGFR, and five of the six tumours with the highest
KRAS amplification also harbour KRAS mutations (Supplementary
Table 11). In many cases, the mutant allele is preferentially amplified
(Supplementary Fig. 6) but larger sample sets are required to deter-
mine the statistical significance.
We investigated the correlation among mutations, copy number
and gene expression in 41 lung adenocarcinomas with all three types
of data. Mutations in TP53 (Fig. 5a) and APC (Fig. 5b) are correlated
with lower copy number and lower messenger RNA expression levels.
Correlations with lower gene expression are also seen for STK11 and
ATM mutations (Supplementary Table 10b). Mutations in these
tumour suppressor genes could cause instability of their cognate
mRNAs. Conversely, mutations in EGFR (Fig. 5c) and KRAS
(Fig. 5d) are associated with higher mRNA expression levels as well
as higher copy number, as are EPHB1 mutations (Supplementary
Table 10b).
Integrated analysis of significantly mutated pathways
Further insight into the role of genomic alterations underlying lung
adenocarcinoma was gained by examining the distribution of muta-
tions across Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathways (Fig. 6, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary
Tables 11–13).
In the MAPK pathway we found 289 mutations in 56 genes,
including members of EGF, FGF and NTRK receptor families, and
KRAS and NF1 (Fig. 6). Notably, 132 of the 188 tumours sequenced
have at least one mutation in the MAPK pathway, underscoring its
pivotal role in lung cancer.
We identified mutations in multiple components of the Wnt path-
way, including APC, CTNNB1, SMAD2, SMAD4 and GSK3B. Of the
188 lung adenocarcinomas 29 showed mutations in this pathway
(not including mutations in TP53, which is included in the Wnt
pathway in KEGG), which is to our knowledge the first demonstra-
tion of Wnt alteration in lung adenocarcinoma. At least one muta-
tion in the p53 pathway was seen in 85 tumours. In addition to the 66
TP53 mutations, frequent mutations were found in ATM and ampli-
fications were identified in MDM2 (Fig. 6).
We have found an array of mutations in PTEN, PI3K genes and
AKT genes—all members of the insulin/PI3K/AKT signalling arm of
this pathway (Fig. 6). In addition, 13 tumours were found to carry 16

NF1 mutations, the deficiency of which has been implicated in RAS-
and PI3K-dependent hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway46. More
than 30 mutations were also discovered in STK11, a member of the
AMP-dependent protein kinase signalling pathway. By sequencing
70 polymorphic STK11 SNP sites, we identified 17 tumours with loss
of heterozygosity (LOH) (as defined by at least three consecutive
heterozygous loci that reduced to homozygosity in the tumour;
Supplementary Table 14). Two tumours having clear regions of
LOH at STK11 also harboured one nonsense mutation and one dele-
tion, suggesting possible homozygous loss of function. Six tumours
have mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (TSC1 and
TSC2). In summary, mTOR pathway components are mutated in 17
genes and in more than 30% of tumours sequenced, not including
tumours with KRAS mutations. Our finding suggests that dysregula-
tion of mTOR is important for lung carcinogenesis and hence is a
potential therapeutic target. The effectiveness of rapamycin and its
analogues in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma should be further
tested.
There are nine mutations in CDKN2A and one each in CDKN2B
and CDKN2C, as well as seven mutations in RB1. Furthermore, as
described there are frequent focal amplifications of CDK4 and CDK6
as well as CCND1 and CCNE1, and frequent deletions of RB1,
CDKN2A and CDKN2B (ref. 34; Fig. 6).
Mutations correlated with clinical features
We investigated the distribution of mutations across different clinical
subgroups, including smoking status, tumour grade, tumour stage
and histological subtype (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 7 and
Supplementary Table 15).
The average number of mutations in smokers is significantly
higher than in individuals who have never smoked (P 5 0.021, t-test),
and notably none of the tumours from those who have never smoked
had more than five mutations in the resequenced genes, whereas
smokers had as many as 49 mutations (Fig. 4b). Consistent with
previous findings47, we observed that EGFR mutations correlate with
the status of patients who have never smoked (P 5 0.0046, Fisher’s
exact test), whereas KRAS mutations correlate with smoker status
(P 5 0.021). We also have observed correlation between mutations
in STK11 and smokers (P 5 0.044), consistent with a previous
report43.
As expected, tumours with higher grade had accumulated more
mutations than tumours of lower grade (P 5 0.001; Supplementary
Fig. 7a). Some genes showed a clear increase in the frequency of
somatic mutation with tumour grade, suggesting that these genes
may have a role in transformation or progression. A clear example
is TP53, with somatic mutations in 13%, 24% and 52% of tumours of
grade 1, 2 and 3, respectively (correlation P 5 7.8 3 10206), consist-
ent with a previous report48. Other genes in which the mutation
frequency positively correlated with tumour grade were LRP1B
(P 5 0.013),
INHBA
(P 5 0.013)
and
PRKDC
(P 5 0.018).
Conversely, other genes showed no significant correlation with
tumour grade, which could indicate that mutations in this group

Figure 6 | Significantly mutated pathways in lung adenocarcinomas.
Genetic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma frequently occur in genes of the
MAPK signalling, p53 signalling, Wnt signalling, cell cycle and mTOR
pathways. Oncoproteins are indicated in pink to red and tumour suppressor
proteins are shown in light to dark blue. The darkness of the colours is
positively correlated to the percentage of tumours with genetic alterations.
Frequency of genetic alterations for each of these pathway members in 188
tumours is indicated. Genes (EGFR, FGFR1, FGFR4, KDR, EPHA3, KRAS,
NRAS, MDM2 and CDK6) lying in regions of focal amplification were
analysed for the percentage of samples with copy number amplification.
Samples with greater than 2.5 and fewer than 1.5 DNA copies were
considered as amplified and deleted, respectively. Selected components of
each pathway are shown in the figure.

of genes are critical early in tumorigenesis. A clear example is KRAS,
with somatic mutations in 38%, 32% and 32% of tumours of grades
1, 2 and 3, respectively.
Our analysis shows that tumours of higher stage had accumulated
more
mutations
than
tumours
of
lower
stage
(P 5 0.006;
Supplementary Fig. 7b), although this rate varies widely among indi-
vidual tumours. We found significant correlations between tumour
stage and mutations in NTRK2 (P 5 0.003), EPHA7 (P 5 0.003),
PRKCG (P 5 0.0087) and FLT4 (P 5 0.0093).
There are several subclasses of lung adenocarcinoma, including
acinar, papillary, BAC (bronchioloalveolar carcinoma) and solid, on
the basis of World Health Organization standards49,50. Our most not-
able finding was that mutations in LRP1B, TP53 and INHBA show
various levels of negative correlation with acinar, papillary and BAC
subtypes, but significant positive correlation with solid subtype
(LRP1B, P 5 2.293 10205; TP53, P 5 0.002; INHBA, P 5 0.0023) in
152 tumours with subtype information. On the other hand mutations
in EGFR showed moderate negative correlation with the solid subtype
(P 5 0.13) and significant positive correlation with the papillary sub-
type (P 5 0.041), consistent with a previous report50.
Furthermore, our analysis shows that the 25 patients in which no
mutations were found have diverse clinical features and some show a
comparable extent of copy number alterations compared to samples
having mutations (Supplementary Table 16). Of note, 16 of 25
tumours without discovered mutations in the 623 genes are from
the group with higher stromal contamination rate (Supplementary
Table 17), suggesting that stromal contamination might reduce the
sensitivity in discovering mutations.
Discussion
Our study represents to our knowledge the largest effort so far to
characterize genomic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma. Before this
study, there were five genes known to be mutated at high frequency in
lung adenocarcinoma—TP53, KRAS, STK11, EGFR and CDKN2A—
as well as several known genes with lower mutation frequencies—
PTEN, NRAS, ERBB2, BRAF and PIK3CA. After sequencing 623
genes in 188 tumours, we have identified further significantly
mutated genes, more than doubling the list. The newly identified
genes include tumour suppressor genes (NF1, RB1, ATM and APC)
along with tyrosine kinase genes (ephrin receptor genes, ERBB4,
KDR, FGFR4 and NTRK genes) that may function as proto-onco-
genes. We have demonstrated that many of these genes are also
targeted by copy number alterations and/or gene expression changes.
Additionally, there is a significant excess of mutations and copy
number alterations in genes from the MAPK, p53, Wnt, cell cycle
and mTOR signalling pathways, suggesting links to the disease. Our
results also demonstrate that lung adenocarcinomas are heterogen-
eous, with diverse combinations of mutations yet commonality in the
main pathways affected by these mutations. The mutation rate varies
across tumour samples and is probably influenced by DNA mismatch
repair defects and clinical features. The newly discovered genes and
pathways may expand the range of potential therapeutic options for
treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. For example, inhibitors of the
MEK kinase could be tested in tumours with NF1 mutations, whereas
inhibitors of KDR, such as sorafenib and sunitinib, might be tested in
tumours with KDR mutations.
Althoughtheanalysisof the188TSPtumours is thelargesttumour-
type-specific screen for mutations to date, it does not have complete
power to detect some genes known to be associated with lung cancer.
Thus,largersamplesizeswill bedesirable. Moreover,theseapproaches
should be extended to other types of lung cancer, metastatic lung
cancer, and other cancers to determine the underlying genetic basis
of those diseases and to highlight potential approaches for diagnosis
and therapy. These studies can also be extended by comprehensive
resequencing of the entire transcriptome, the entire collection of
exons or theentiregenome in large collections of cancers. Suchstudies
should be feasible with next-generation sequencing technologies and
at present are being prototyped within this programme.
METHODS SUMMARY
Source DNAs were extracted from primary lung adenocarcinoma tumours and
adjacent normal tissue (or peripheral blood lymphocytes). Collection and use of
all tissue samples were approved by the human subjects Institutional Review
Boards of participating institutions. These samples were snap-frozen, anon-
ymized and contributed along with matched normal samples by the Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center, University of Michigan, and Washington University
in St Louis. Affymetrix 250K StyI Array data were used to estimate the level of
stromal contamination and thereby to select 188 tumours and matched normals
for the resequencing study. Whole-genome amplification was performed using
Qiagen REPLI-g Service before sequencing. All coding exons and splice-site
sequences of 623 target genes were PCR amplified and sequenced on both strands
for all of the tumours. Additional data were generated until more than 90% of
targeted exonic and splice-site bases were covered by at least one sequence read.
Traces were automatically processed to identify SNPs and indels. Sequence data
were obtained for the matched normals from a variety of platforms to determine
the somatic status of new variants and unvalidated dbSNPs. Further data were
generated using orthogonal technologies to validate the candidate somatic muta-
tions. Synonymous somatic mutations identified in 250 genes were used to
estimate the background mutation rate, which was used in statistical calculations
to identify significantly mutated genes. Statistical approaches were used to
identify significantly mutated pathways. Expression profiles were determined
for 75 TSP tumours using the Affymetrix U133Plus2 GeneChip. Further analyses
were performed to determine correlation between mutation and copy number
variation, mutation and gene expression, copy number variation and gene
expression, as well as mutation and clinical attributes.
