Prior studies have identified recurrent oncogenic mutations 
in colorectal adenocarcinoma1 and have surveyed exons 
of protein-coding genes for mutations in 11 affected 
individuals2,3. Here we report whole-genome sequencing from 
nine individuals with colorectal cancer, including primary 
colorectal tumors and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues, 
at an average of 30.7× and 31.9× coverage, respectively. We 
identify an average of 75 somatic rearrangements per tumor, 
including complex networks of translocations between pairs 
of chromosomes. Eleven rearrangements encode predicted in-
frame fusion proteins, including a fusion of VTI1A and TCF7L2 
found in 3 out of 97 colorectal cancers. Although TCF7L2 
encodes TCF4, which cooperates with b-catenin4 in colorectal 
carcinogenesis5,6, the fusion lacks the TCF4 b-catenin–binding 
domain. We found a colorectal carcinoma cell line harboring 
the fusion gene to be dependent on VTI1A-TCF7L2 for 
anchorage-independent growth using RNA interference-
mediated knockdown. This study shows previously unidentified 
levels of genomic rearrangements in colorectal carcinoma that 
can lead to essential gene fusions and other oncogenic events.
Colorectal cancer has served as a model to understand the progressive 
acquisition of oncogenic mutations in genes and pathways such as 
APC, CTNNB1, TP53, RAS genes and TGF-β signaling1,7. Exome-wide 
sequencing has recently identified additional recurrent mutations 
that may contribute to carcinogenesis2,3. Further, genomic studies of 
colorectal cancer have detailed subgroups of tumors characterized 
by chromosomal instability (~60–70%), or by a high degree of micro­
satellite instability, often associated with hereditary or sporadic mis­
match repair deficiency (~15%), with additional cases falling between 
these classes7,8.
We sequenced the genomes of nine colorectal cancers and paired 
non-neoplastic tissue controls (Table 1). Tumors were resected before 
administration of chemotherapy or radiation and were selected for 
sequencing based upon a pathology-estimated purity of >70%. We used 
SNP arrays to confirm tumor purity and inferred ploidy and to select 
samples with copy-number alterations suggestive of a chromosomal-
instability phenoytpe. We whole-genome sequenced these samples 
with paired 101-base reads with an average of 30.7× sequence 
coverage of the tumor genomes and 31.9× coverage of the germline 
(Table 1). We were able to reliably call mutations at ~83% of bases 
(with a range of 78–87%) based on the ability to uniquely align 
sequence reads and obtain ≥14× coverage in the tumor and ≥8× 
coverage in the germline.
These cases revealed frequent alterations in both sequence and 
genomic structure. Using the MuTect and Indelocator algorithms9–11, 
we called 137,968 candidate somatic mutations across the nine samples. 
To evaluate our mutation calling, we validated candidate mutations 
predicted to cause non-synonymous substitutions or insertions-dele­
tions in protein-coding sequences (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

Among these 712 candidates, 521 could be tested by mass spectro­
metric genotyping, and we validated 84% (439) as somatic alterations. 
Notably, genotyping validation rates were ~95% (292 out of 308) for 
mutations at a high allele fraction (>0.33). The higher validation rate 
for higher allele fraction mutations is consistent with the possibility 
that mass spectrometric techniques require a minimum threshold for 
variant allele detection.
The whole-genome sequence also allows us to evaluate the overall 
features of somatic mutations. Using all candidate mutations, we 
calculated an overall mutation rate of ~5.9 per Mb with a range of 
4.0–9.8 mutations per Mb relative to a haploid genome (Table 1). 
Assuming that as many as 16% of these events are false positives, 
this would predict a mutation rate of ~5 mutations per Mb. This 
mutation rate exceeds the previously estimated rate of 1.2 mutations 
per Mb derived from a sequencing tiling array3, likely reflecting the 
greater sensitivity of massively parallel sequencing. The mutation rate 
is somewhat higher in intergenic regions (6.7 per Mb) than in intronic 
and exonic sequences (4.8 per Mb and 4.2 per Mb, respectively), 
presumably because of selection pressure and transcription-coupled 
repair12,13. Within coding sequences, the rate of non-synonymous 
mutations that we saw, 3.1 per Mb, resembles the 2.8 per Mb rate seen 
from Sanger resequencing2.
The base context of the somatic mutations is consistent with previ­
ous reports that colorectal cancers show a strong predilection for C>T 
transitions at CpG dinucleotides2,3; we found an increase in muta­
tions at CpG sites (37–72 per million sites) compared to all mutations 
other than CpG transitions (3.2–8.5 per Mb) (Supplementary Fig. 1). 
Inspection of consensus loci used to test for sporadic mismatch repair 
deficiency14 showed no signs of microsatellite 
instability. We observed low rates of inser­
tions-deletions within coding regions (0–5 
events per tumor).
Analysis of the non-synonymous coding 
somatic substitutions and small insertions-
deletions identified 24 genes with such muta­
tions in two or more tumors (Supplementary 
Table 3). Although the small sample set 
provides inadequate power to detect recur­
rent mutations, KRAS, APC and TP53 
nonetheless scored as significant relative to 
the background mutation rate. Indeed, we 
noted mutations in KRAS, APC and TP53 
in five, seven and six individuals’ tumors, 
respectively (Supplementary Table 2). We 
found other genes with known colorectal 
cancer mutations, such as NRAS, SMAD4, 
PIK3CA and FBXW7, to be mutated here, 
but these genes’ rates of mutation did not

reach ­statistical significance given the small 
sample set. Large sequencing projects will be 
needed to identify a fuller set of genes with 
significant recurrent mutations; such projects are now being carried 
out under The Cancer Genome Atlas (see URLs).
Whole-genome sequencing enables detailed study of the nature of 
chromosomal rearrangements. Using our algorithm (dRanger10,11), 
we identified 675 candidate somatic rearrangements across the nine 
tumors (mean, 75; range 5–182; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 4) 
by identifying instances where multiple paired reads map to distinct 
genomic loci or with incorrect orientations. To assess the accuracy 
of these findings, we tested 331 candidate somatic rearrangements 
by performing PCR across the putative junction in tumor and germ­
line DNA; we pooled the PCR products and pyrosequenced them. 
We confirmed 92% of the calls as true somatic rearrangements; we 
found four calls (~1%) to be germline rearrangements and removed 
them from further analysis, and the remaining 22 calls (~7%) failed 
to yield PCR products in either tumor or germline DNA. Tumors 
with more somatic coding mutations also harbored more rearrange­
ments (R2 = 0.55).
The majority (82%) of predicted rearrangements are intrachro­
mosomal, and among these events, roughly half (46%) involve ‘long-
range’ events connecting chromosomal regions more than 1 Mb 
apart. We classified the short-range rearrangements, occurring at 
sub-Mb scales, as deletions (64%), tandem duplications (19%) and 
inversions (17%) based on an analysis of the paired-end sequences 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). We studied the sequence at the breakpoints 
in these rearrangements using pyrosequencing of PCR products 
spanning the junctions and also using identification in our sequenc­
ing of fusion sequences joining predicted rearrangements using the 
BreakPointer tool10. The junctions typically show significant micro­
homology of 1–6 bases and insertion of non-template DNA is uncom­
mon (Supplementary Fig. 1), observations that are consistent with 
results reported in breast cancer15. Also consistent with prior reports, 
tandem duplications show a greater degree of microhomology15.
Three samples (CRC-3, CRC-4 and CRC-6) showed clustering of 
inter-chromosomal translocations, where a series of rearrangements 
leads to extensive regional shuffling of two to three distinct chromo­
somes through balanced translocations (Fig. 1). We saw networks 
of fusions between chromosomes 8 and 20 in CRC-4 and chromo­
somes 5 and 11 in CRC-6 (Fig. 2). Because most of these events do 
not involve regions of substantial copy-number alterations, they 
represent a variant of a pattern (termed chromothripsis16) involv­
ing alternating copy-number states induced by a single catastrophic 
complex genomic event. Our results show the potential for complex 
structural alterations to occur in regions of the genome that appear 
to be ‘quiet’ based on copy-number profiling.
We examined the specific genes affected by the genomic 
re­arrangements. We found small deletions in well-known cancer-
related genes, including a deletion that removed the first exon of 
EGFR in CRC-9 and a deletion removing the 3′ section of PTEN in 
CRC-8. Twenty-six genes harbored breakpoints in multiple samples. 
The most frequently rearranged genes were MACROD2, A2BP1, FHIT

and IMMP2L (Supplementary Table 3), which span large genomic 
loci. Previous work has shown that such genes are frequently subject 
to focal deletions in cancer17,18, possibly because of structural fragil­
ity. Notably, two samples, CRC-5 and CRC-7, contain chromosome 
3:12 translocations in which distinct intergenic regions of chromo­
some 3 are fused to the first intron of the methyltransferase-encoding 
PRMT8. However, we identified no detectable PRMT8 transcript in 
RNA from either of the two samples (data not shown).
We next sought to identify functional fusion genes. Such events have 
been previously seen in carcinomas from the lung19 and ­prostate20, 
among others, but to our knowledge have not been reported in colon 
carcinomas. We found 11 rearrangements (2 interchromosomal and 
9 intrachromosomal rearrangements) that could give rise to in-frame 
fusion transcripts (Table 2). By screening complementary DNA 
(cDNA) from a panel of 97 primary colorectal cancers, we found 
that one of these possible fusion transcripts is recurrently expressed. 
The initial observation, which occurred in CRC-9, involved an intra­
chromosomal fusion on chromosome 10, fusing the first three exons 
of VTI1A, which encodes a v-SNARE protein mediating fusion of 
intracellular vesicles within the Golgi complex21, to the fourth 
exon of the adjacent gene, TCF7L2 (Fig. 3a–c). We found in-frame 
VTI1A-TCF7L2 fusions in two additional cases and three of 97 total 
primary colorectal carcinomas (including the CRC-9 index case) 
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
The discovery of recurrent VTI1A-TCF7L2 fusions is of parti­cular 
interest. TCF7L2 encodes a transcription factor, known as TCF4 
and belonging to the TCF/LEF family, that dimerizes with β-catenin 
(encoded by CTNNB1) to activate and repress transcription of genes 
essential for proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial 
cells22. TCF7L2 is the most widely expressed member of the TCF/LEF 
family in colorectal cancer23 and its expression is inversely associ­
ated with survival in colorectal cancer24. Moreover, the inherited 
risk of colorectal cancer is affected by polymorphisms in TCF7L2 
(refs. 25,26) as well as by a polymorphism in an enhancer of MYC 
at which TCF4 and β-catenin cooperatively bind27,28. Notably, 
TCF7L2 is known to harbor somatic point mutations in colorectal 
cancer2,3. We additionally found a point mutation in CRC-5 affect­
ing the splice-site at the 3′ end of exon 10, which is the exon encod­
ing the HMG-box DNA binding domain, that would likely be a 
deleterious mutation.
To test the functional importance of the VTI1A-TCF7L2 fusion, we 
sought a cell line harboring this event. Because the fusion in CRC-9 is 
caused by a ~540-kb deletion between VTI1A and TCF7L2, we studied 
SNP array data from 38 colorectal cancer cell lines to search for a simi­
lar deletion. We found that the cell line NCI-H508 (Supplementary 
Fig. 2) carries such a deletion, and we showed the presence of an in-
frame fusion transcript linking exon 2 of VTI1A to exon 5 of TCF7L2. 
We designed RNA-interference vectors targeting the sequence span­
ning the fusion. Two vectors that reduced the expression of the fusion 
mRNA by >70% as gauged by quantitative RT-PCR caused a dramatic 
reduction in the anchorage-independent growth of cells from NCI-
H508 but not DLD-1, a colorectal cancer cell line that does not harbor 
the fusion gene (Fig. 3d,e). This result shows that the VTI1A-TCF7L2 
fusion plays a critical role in NCI-H508 cell growth.
The biochemical function of the VTI1A-TCF7L2 fusion protein 
is unclear. The fusion omits the amino-terminal domain of TCF4, 
which binds β-catenin (Fig. 3c). For other members of the TCF/LEF 
family (but not for TCF7L2), isoforms omitting the amino-­terminal 
domain occur naturally and yield dominant-negative proteins29. 
However, we do not expect the VTI1A-TCF7L2 fusion protein to 
act as a full ­dominant-negative protein because engineered domi­
nant-negative TCF4 alleles have been shown to strongly inhibit 
proliferation of colorectal carcinoma cell lines30. Given the omis­
sion of the β-catenin binding domain in this fusion gene, we ini­
tially hypothesized that this newly identified protein could enable 
β-catenin–independent activation of TCF4 and/or β-catenin targets. 
However, the three tumors harboring the fusion protein also carry 
mutations in APC, whose product suppresses β-catenin. (CRC-9 
has one frameshift and one nonsense mutation in APC, the second 
tumor harbors a homozygous ~90-kb deletion within APC, and the 
third tumor has a p.Ala1247Val APC alteration). NCI-H508 is 
heter­ozygous for APC (carrying a hemizygous deletion) and carries

­normal alleles at CTNNB1, which encodes β-catenin, yet is function­
ally dependent upon β-catenin (Supplementary Fig. 2).
These results suggest that VTI1A-TCF7L2 is expressed in the set­
ting of activated β-catenin and that NCI-H508 is dependent on both 
the fusion gene and β-catenin despite the deletion of the VTI1A-
TCF7L2 β-catenin binding domain. Studies will be needed to deter­
mine whether and how (i) the fusion gene interacts or interferes 
with the function of β-catenin and (ii) the addition of a section of an 
N-terminal SNARE domain affects function or localization. When 
coupled to the recent report of TCF7L2 mutations in colorectal cancer 
and evidence that TCF4 can also have tumor suppressive functions 
in colorectal neoplasia31,32, these data suggest additional complexity 
regarding the function of β-catenin and its cooperating factors in 
colorectal cancer.
This report describes the first whole-genome sequencing study of 
colorectal cancer. Our results provide no evidence for high-frequency 
recurrent translocations, such as those that are seen in prostate adeno­
carcinoma20. However, the discovery of the recurrent VTI1A-TCF7L2 
fusion in 3% of colorectal cancers shows that functionally important fusion 
events occur in this disease and suggest that further structural characteri­
zation will likely identify additional new recurrent rearrangements.

ONLINE METHODS
Sample selection and preparation. Colorectal adenocarcinoma and matched 
adjacent non-cancerous colon from affected individuals not previously treated 
with chemotherapy or radiation were collected and frozen at the time of sur­
gery under institutional review board–approved protocols (each collection 
was approved by the local institutional review board of the center where sur­
gery was performed.  Subsequently, the Broad Institute’s institutional review 
board reviewed the local institutional review board approvals and consent 
documents to approve the use of samples for sequencing see Supplementary 
Note). Tumors were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and to estimate tumor 
content. Nine tumors with an estimated tumor content of at least 70% were 
selected. DNA was extracted using standard techniques.
Tumor DNA samples were processed and hybridized to Affymetrix SNP 
arrays for copy number analysis. Six of the samples had been evaluated using 
the STY I array34. The remaining tumors were evaluated with SNP6 arrays. 
Array data were processed and segmented using standard approaches to iden­
tify copy number aberrations35. SNP array data were further analyzed using the 
tool ABSOLUTE (S.L. Carter, M. Meyerson & G. Getz, personal communica­
tion) to infer the tumor purity and ploidy10,11. Tumors were required to have 
either an estimated purity of 50% or an allelic ratio of 0.25.
Whole-genome sequencing. Sequencing was performed using Illumina 
GA-II10. Briefly, 1–3 micrograms of DNA from each sample were used to 
­prepare the sequencing library through shearing of the DNA followed by ­ligation 
of ­sequencing adaptors. Each sample was sequenced on multiple Illumina flow 
cells with paired 101-bp reads to achieve ~30× genomic coverage.
Sequence data processing. Raw data were processed using the ‘Picard’ pipe­
line, which was developed at the Broad Institute9. As described previously10,11, 
the BAM file for each tumor and germline sample (hg18) were generated and 
imported into the Firehose analysis pipeline11. This system has been designed 
to house input files containing sequence data and then organize the execu­
tion of multiple analytic tools to identify somatic aberrations. Copy-number 
analysis of sequence data was performed as described previously using whole-
genome sequencing data36.
Calculation of sequence coverage, mutation calling and significance ­analysis. 
We compared the concordance of sequencing calls and SNP genotypes, which 
is one metric of sequencing coverage for mutation detection37. From the 
Affymetrix data in tumors, we extracted the high-confidence heterozygous 
genotype calls and compared these to the genotypes extracted from the Illumina 
data. We identified concordance rates of 94–99% in the tumors and 97–99% in 
the matched germline DNA samples. We further evaluated the fraction of all 
bases suitable for mutation calling whereby a base is defined as covered if at least 
14 and 8 reads overlapped the base in the tumor and in the germline sequenc­
ing, respectively. Those covered regions were subsequently evaluated for single 
nucleotide variations using MuTect9–11. Passing single nucleotide variants found 
within coding areas of the genome were annotated for their predicted effect on 
the amino acid sequence and on exon splicing. Coding areas were evaluated for 
insertion-deletion events using the Indelocator algorithm10,11.
From the candidate somatic mutations and insertions-deletions, predicted 
non-synonymous coding alterations were validated in both tumor and matched 
germline DNA using multiplexed mass spectrometric genotyping10,35. Among 
712 total candidates, genotyping assays could be designed against and yielded 
interpretable data for a subset (521 candidates), producing a validation rate of 
84%. Notably, all assays from CRC-5 failed in PCR because of degradation of 
the DNA from this tumor occurring after Illumina library construction and 
sequencing; these assays were removed from evaluation of the validation rates. 
Candidate mutations identified in the non-tumor DNA were considered to be 
germline polymorphisms and were removed from analysis. Given the possibil­
ity for false negative results from our validation experiments (in particular, 
the known lack of sensitivity of multiplexed mass spectrometric genotyping in 
the case of mutations present at low allele fraction), to maximize the potential 
for discovery of new events, we included in our analysis all 699 mutations not 
invalidated as germline. As shown in Supplementary Table 1, mutations are 
annotated as to those that were tested and validated, tested and not validated 
and those not tested because of assay failure.
After all coding single nucleotide variants and insertion-deletions were 
identified, the MutSig algorithm was used to identify genes subject to recur­
rent non-synonymous genetic alterations at a rate above that which would 
be expected by chance10,11. The calculated likelihood for a certain number 
of mutations to occur by chance takes into account the base context of the 
mutations and the rates of those events in the set of genomes. A false dis­
covery rate (or q value) of 0.05 was used as the cutoff to define signifi­
cance. All mutation rates are calculated relative to the theoretical underlying 
haploid genome.
Identification of rearrangements. The dRanger algorithm10,11 was used to 
identify genomic rearrangements by identifying instances where the two read 
pairs map to distinct regions or map in such a manner that suggests another 
structural event, such as an inversion. All such candidate lesions were then 
queried in both the matched germline genome and a panel of non-tumor 
genomes to remove events detected in germline genomes. The final scorings 
of these somatic reads were then calculated by multiplying the number of 
supporting read pairs by the estimated ‘quality’ of the candidate rearrange­
ment, a measure ranging from 0 to 1 that takes into account the alignability of 
the two regions joined by the putative rearrangement and also the chance of 
seeing such a read pair given the libraries’ fragment-size distributions. Those 
events with resulting scores ≥3 (and thus seen in at least three read pairs) were 
included in this analysis. Validation of rearrangements was performed by PCR 
using primers spanning the predicted breakpoints as described previously10. 
PCR products were sequenced on the 454 pyrosequencing platform with DNA 
from tumor and matched normal samples to validate the presence and somatic 
status of candidate events. For those events failing validation in the first set 
of PCRs, a follow-up round of PCR and pyrosequencing was performed with 
two sets of primers per candidate rearrangement.
To identify the DNA sequence of the actual fusion between two genomic 
loci, the BreakPointer algorithm was employed. BreakPointer searches for 
read pairs where one read is mapped entirely on one side of the breakpoint 
and the pair mate is partly mapped on the breakpoint or failed to align any­
where. It is expected that many of these reads span the actual fusion point. 
These unmapped reads are subjected to a modified Smith-Waterman align­
ment procedure with the ability to jump between the two reference sequences 
at the most fitting point (Drier, Y. et al., manuscript in preparation). From 
these breakpoints, the degree of base overlap or microhomology of the two 
adjoined sequences was calculated, and insertions of non-template DNA 
were identified. BreakPointer analysis of the Illumina data was able to predict 
fusion sites of 214 rearrangements, of which 200 (93.5%) were validated by 
pyrosequencing data.
Validation of the VTI1A-TCF7L2 fusion transcript. The NCI-H508 cell line 
was identified from SNP-array–derived copy number from a collection of 
38 colorectal cancer cell lines in the Broad-Novartis Cell Line Encyclopedia. 
RNA prepared from samples of fresh-frozen colorectal adenocarcinomas or, 
in the case of the NCI-H508 cell line, a fresh cell pellet, were used for cDNA 
synthesis with the QIAGEN QuantiTect kit. cDNA quality was assessed 
by the ability to PCR amplify the GAPDH transcript. Passing cDNA was 
evaluated with a first round of PCR using primers to the 5′ untranslated 
region of VTI1A and exon 6 of TCF7L2 and then nested PCR using primers 
from the first exon of VTI1A and exon 5 of TCF7L2 (the primers used are 
listed in Supplementary Table 5). Bands were gel purified, cloned (TOPO 
TA Cloning; Invitrogen) and sequenced to validate the presence and frame 
of fusion.
RNA-interference experiments. Using the sequence of the junction between 
exon 2 of VTI1A and exon 5 of TCF7L2 from the NCI-H508 cell line, shRNA 
vectors containing 21-base seed sequences uniquely homologous to the fusion 
sequence were generated and cloned into the pLKO lentiviral vector38. From 
these vectors and a control shRNA vector targeting GFP, the lentivirus was 
produced and used to infect the NCI-508 cell lines39. Following puromycin 
selection, RNA was extracted for cDNA synthesis. Real-time PCR (using two 
distinct primer sets quantifying the VTI1A-TCF7L2 fusion; Supplementary 
Table 5) was used to quantitate the expression of VTI1A-TCF7L2 mRNA rela­
tive to expression of a GAPDH control. Two shRNAs, which were able to induce

significant (~70%) knockdown, were selected for further experiments. These 
vectors are labeled shFusionA (target GAAGCGAAAGAACTGTCTAAC) 
and shFusionB (target GCGAAAGAACTGTCTAACAAA). Following new 
infections of these viruses and shGFP into NCI-H508 and DLD-1 cell lines, 
both cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) with 10% 
FBS with glutamine and penicillin streptomycin, cells were selected with 
puromycin and then plated into soft agar as previously described to evaluate 
anchorage-independent growth39.
For knockdown of CTNNB1 in the NCI-H508 cells, two CTNNB1 shRNA 
constructs that had been closed into a doxycline-inducible version of the 
pLKO.1 vector were used. The two vectors contained sequencing target­
ing the following sites: sh35: CCCTAGCCTTGCTTGTTAAAA and sh36: 
GGACAAGCCACAAGATTACAA, with knockdown verified by real-time 
PCR (Applied Bisosystems Hs00170025_m1). Cells infected with NTC 
(non-targeting control) or CTNNB1 shRNA were grown in the presence or 
absence of 20 ng/ml doxycycline for 48 h. To quantitate knockdown, RNA 
from shRNA-infected cells was quantified with real-time PCR. Cells were 
then placed into soft agar in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml doxycycline 
to assess colony formation.
