Craniopharyngiomas are epithelial tumors that typically arise 
in the suprasellar region of the brain1. Patients experience 
substantial clinical sequelae from both extension of the tumors 
and therapeutic interventions that damage the optic chiasm, 
the pituitary stalk and the hypothalamic area2–4. Using 
whole-exome sequencing, we identified mutations in 
CTNNB1 (-catenin) in nearly all adamantinomatous 
craniopharyngiomas examined (11/12, 92%) and recurrent 
mutations in BRAF (resulting in p.Val600Glu) in all 
papillary craniopharyngiomas (3/3, 100%). Targeted 
genotyping revealed BRAF p.Val600Glu in 95% of papillary 
craniopharyngiomas (36 of 39 tumors) and mutation of 
CTNNB1 in 96% of adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas 
(51 of 53 tumors). The CTNNB1 and BRAF mutations were 
clonal in each tumor subtype, and we detected no other 
recurrent mutations or genomic aberrations in either subtype. 
Adamantinomatous and papillary craniopharyngiomas harbor 
mutations that are mutually exclusive and clonal. These 
findings have important implications for the diagnosis and 
treatment of these neoplasms.
Craniopharyngiomas occur at an average age-adjusted incidence 
rate of 0.18 per 100,000 (ref. 5). There are two main subtypes of 
craniopharyngiomas—the adamantinomatous form that is more 
common in children and the papillary form that occurs predomi­
nantly in adults. Located in or above the sella turcica, craniophar­
yngiomas grow adjacent to the optic chiasm and often extend to 
involve the hypothalamus, cranial nerves, ventricular system, 
visual pathways and major blood vessels at the base of the brain. 
Curative surgery is exceedingly difficult6, and resection can 
contribute to complications. The spectrum of complications include 
visual defects, severe headaches, pan-hypopituitarism, impaired 
intellectual function and wide-ranging hypothalamic dysfunc­
tion leading to sleep disorders7, abnormal thermoregulation and 
diabetes insipidus, as well as to hyperphagia and uncontrollable 
obesity2–4. Aptly, Harvey Cushing, the father of neurosurgery, who 
introduced the term ‘craniopharyngioma’ declared them “the most 
formidable of intracranial tumors.”8,9
Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that drive craniophar­
yngiomas remains limited, which has hampered the development of 
systemic therapies for this type of tumor. Mutations in exon 3 of 
CTNNB1 (β-catenin), which encodes a degradation targeting motif, 
have been described in adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas, 
occurring in 60–75% of patients in most published series10–12. 
However, mutations that drive the growth of papillary craniopharyn­
giomas have not been identified. To that end, we performed massively

mutations previously described in this tumor type and were located 
in exon 3 exclusively10,12. In addition, adamantinomatous cranio­
pharyngiomas harbored isolated mutations in genes that have been 
implicated previously in cancer (Fig. 2). We identified mutations 
in genes listed in the Cancer Gene Census16 that are involved in 
transcriptional regulation (BCOR, CRTC3, MITF and PRDM1) and 
epigenetic regulation (KDM5A and SMARCA4), as well as in DNA 
repair (BRCA2) (Fig. 2). We detected additional mutations in genes 
not listed in the Cancer Gene Census but that have described roles 
in cancer, including genes involved in chromatin remodeling and 
regulation of transcription (including ASCC2, KAT5, PIWIL1, SIN3A 
and SMC1A), cell cycle and DNA repair (including ATR, BARD1, 
CDC25B, HBP1, RBBP8 and RTEL1) and cell adhesion (ITGA3, PKD1, 
PKD1L1, PODN, ROCK1 and RPTN)16. However, many of these may 
be passenger mutations that do not contribute to tumor initiation 
or progression.
All three of the papillary craniopharyngiomas in our discovery 
set harbored mutations (c.1799T > A) in the well-established 
oncogene BRAF (resulting in p.Val600Glu) that have been shown 
to constitutively activate this serine-threonine kinase that regulates 
MAP kinase (also called ERK) signaling and affects cell division and 
differentiation (Fig. 2). None of the three papillary craniopharyn­
giomas had mutations in CTNNB1. Although two of these samples 
were resected from adults (31 and 52 years old), one of the samples 
was from a rare papillary craniopharyngioma that occurred in a child 
(9 years old), suggesting a similar pathogenesis between pediatric and 
adult papillary craniopharyngiomas. We did not identify mutations 
in other genes listed in the Cancer Gene Census in these tumors, but 
we did note isolated mutations in other genes with potential roles 
parallel sequencing of 15 craniopharyngiomas from both subtypes 
and targeted genotyping in samples from 95 additional patients.
We first used whole-exome sequencing to analyze the DNA 
from a discovery cohort of adamantinomatous (n = 12) and 
papillary (n = 3) craniopharyngiomas (Supplementary Table 1).
As craniopharyngiomas are often heterogeneous tumors with nests 
of tumor cells interspersed between large amounts of reactive 
tissue and stromal cells, we expected the mutations to have low 
allelic fractions (i.e., the mutations might only be found in a small 
subset of the sequenced cells because of substantial contamination 
by normal cells). Thus, we analyzed the sequencing data with a 
recently described method—MuTect—that uses a Bayesian clas­
sifier to identify somatic mutations with very low allelic fractions 
coupled with filters that provide high specificity13.
In consonance with the benign histology of these tumors, we iden­
tified only a relatively small number of nonsynonymous somatic 
mutations in both craniopharyngioma subtypes when compared to 
large cohorts of other tumor types14 (Fig. 1). The nonsynonymous 
mutation rate of 0.9 per Mb in the craniopharyngioma samples was 
similar to that found in a number of pediatric tumors, as well as that in 
low-grade tumors in adults, for example, World Health Organization–
classified grade I meningioma15 (Fig. 1). 58% of the mutations were 
cytosine to thymidine at CpG dinucleotides, which is consistent 
with spontaneous deamination and not a carcinogen-induced 
process (Fig. 1)14. As we anticipated, the allelic fraction for many of 
the mutations was very low (median, 3%; range, 0.96–48%).
The most frequently mutated gene was CTNNB1, with mutations in 
this gene present in 11 of 12 adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas 
(Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 2–4). These events overlapped with 
Figure 1  Plot of the number of nonsynonymous mutations per megabase in craniopharyngiomas (n = 15) in comparison to a broad range of pediatric and 
adult tumors n = 3,083). Data for all other tumor types, as well as the figure design, were taken from Lawrence et al.14. Each dot in this plot 
corresponds to a matched tumor-normal pair. The vertical position indicates the frequency of somatic mutations in that exome. Tumor types are ordered 
on the basis of their median nonsynonymous frequency, and within each tumor type, tumor-normal pairs are ordered from lowest to highest frequency. 
The relative proportions of six different possible base-pair substitutions are indicated at the bottom. Craniopharyngioma data are derived from 
whole-exome sequencing of 15 tumor-normal pairs, including 12 adamantinomatous and 3 papillary craniopharyngioma, and are marked in red.

in cancer, including genes encoding chromatin remodeling factors 
(CHD5 and CHD6)17 and cell adhesion molecules (CDH26 and 
PTPRT)18 and one gene (KIAA1549) that is fused to BRAF in most 
cases of pilocytic astrocytoma19,20. These mutations, similarly to some 
of those found in adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas, may also 
be passenger mutations.
We used MutSig14 to analyze the list of mutations identified in our 
discovery cohort of 15 cases to identify genes that are significantly 
mutated. Although our cohort is small compared to those from other 
genomic studies14 (Fig. 1), the prevalence of mutations in CTNNB1 
and BRAF was so high that we were readily able to detect these muta­
tions as being statistically significant (Fig. 2).
To validate our findings, we used targeted genotyping approaches 
to analyze an additional 98 craniopharyngioma samples (from 95 
different patients) for mutations in the most commonly mutated 
genes in our discovery cohort—BRAF and CTNNB1. We also per­
formed immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an antibody (VE1) that 
selectively recognizes the BRAF p.Val600Glu mutant epitope and 
not the wild-type epitope from BRAF21. In addition, we evaluated 
the activation status of β-catenin using an antibody that allowed 
us to detect nuclear (activated) and membranous (inactivated)
β-catenin12. In total, our validation cohort consisted of 39 papillary 
craniopharyngioma tumors from 36 different patients and 59 ada­
mantinomatous craniopharyngioma tumors, each from a different 
patient (Supplementary Table 1). Although we detected CTNNB1 
mutations in the adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma samples 
(51 of 53 samples, 96%), none of these samples harbored BRAF muta­
tions (resulting in p.Val600Glu, p.Val600Asp, p.Val600Leu, p.Val600Met 
or p.Val600Lys). We identified cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin by 
IHC in all of the adamantinomatous samples tested, but β-catenin 
was localized exclusively to the cytoplasmic membrane in all papillary 
cranio­pharyngioma samples tested (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1).
Remarkably, by targeted genotyping and IHC, we detected the 
p.Val600Glu alteration in 34 of the 36 patients with papillary cranio­
pharyngiomas (94.4%) (Supplementary Table 1).
The allelic fraction of mutations (including those in BRAF 
and CTNNB1) in our whole-exome data was low (Fig. 2a and 
Supplementary Table 2). This raised the possibility of genetic het­
erogeneity in our tumor samples. To assess this possibility, we used 
a recently developed computational method (Online Methods) that 
corrects for tumor purity and estimates the fraction of cancer cell 
nuclei that harbor a particular mutation (cancer cell fraction; CCF). 
Although these methods demonstrated that most of the somatic muta­
tions identified in our samples were indeed subclonal, we found that 
the mutations in BRAF and CTNNB1 were clonal (i.e., they were 
present in all tumor cells) in the analyzed samples (Figs. 2a and 4a 
and Supplementary Table 2).
To further validate our analysis of intratumor heterogeneity, 
we reviewed the pattern and distribution of BRAF staining in the

craniopharyngioma samples (Supplementary Table 1). Using the 
antibody selective for BRAF p.Val600Glu, we did not detect BRAF 
p.Val600Glu in the adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma samples 
(Supplementary Table 1) or in two of the papillary craniopharyn­
gioma samples with wild-type BRAF that we tested (Fig. 4b). In 
the genetically confirmed BRAF p.Val600Glu mutant samples, 
however, we observed widespread immunoreactivity across the tumor 
cell population. In these samples, lymphocytes and stromal cells 
of the fibrovascular core of the tumors were not immunoreactive, 
but the squamopapillary tumor epithelium stained diffusely for 
BRAF p.Val600Glu. This observation supports the conclusion 
that BRAF mutations are present uniformly throughout the neoplastic 
epithelial cells.
Our whole-exome sequencing data of craniopharyngiomas 
demonstrates that the adamantinomatous and papillary subtypes 
have distinct molecular underpinnings, each driven principally 
by mutations in a single well-established oncogene: CTNNB1 
(β-catenin) in the adamantinomatous form and BRAF in the papillary 
form, independent of age.
These mutations appear to be critical events in the pathogenesis of 
these tumors for several reasons. First, the high prevalence of muta­
tions in CTNNB1 and BRAF in craniopharyngiomas occurs among 
an overall paucity of additional mutations, supporting that these 
particular mutations are likely instrumental to the growth of these 
tumors. Second, the mutations are clonal and segregate perfectly with 
their respective histologic subtypes, indicating that they are defining 
genetic aberrations. Moreover, the frequencies of these CTNNB1 and 
BRAF mutations are much higher in craniopharyngiomas than in 
most other tumor types that bear these mutations.
Given the mutual exclusivity of mutations in BRAF and CTNNB1, 
immunohistochemistry for BRAF p.Val600Glu and β-catenin could 
be used to routinely distinguish papillary from adamantinomatous 
craniopharyngiomas and thereby direct patients to appropriate 
clinical trials. Whereas agents that target WNT signaling remain 
in development22,23, the availability of BRAF inhibitors such as 
vemurafenib24–29 and dabrafenib30,31 suggests that patients with 
papillary craniopharyngiomas could benefit immediately from 
such targeted therapeutics. These agents have shown a robust 
clinical response against BRAF p.Val600Glu mutant melanomas25 
and hairy cell leukemias32, as well as brain tumors such as pleo­
morphic xanthoastrocytoma33,34 and ganglioglioma34,35. Trials of 
these therapeutics for papillary craniopharyngiomas should be 
explored in patients with either residual or recurrent tumors after 
surgical resection. In addition, BRAF inhibitors could be evalu­
ated as a first-line therapy to be used before surgical resection or 
radiation therapy.
In summary, our discovery of frequent and clonal mutations in 
adamantinomatous and papillary craniopharyngioma in CTNNB1 
and BRAF, respectively, offers valuable opportunities for testing 
molecularly guided therapeutics for the treatment of these formida­
ble brain tumors.

ONLINE METHODS
Sample selection and preparation. The study was reviewed and approved 
by the human subjects institutional review boards of the Dana-Farber 
Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Broad Institute of 
Harvard and MIT, Boston Children’s Hospital, Johns Hopkins Hospital, 
Children’s Cancer Hospital Egypt and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants whose tumor 
samples were subjected to whole-exome sequencing. Histologic diagno­
sis was reconfirmed on all samples by a board-certified neuropathologist 
(S.S.), and representative fresh-frozen and paraffin-embedded blocks with 
estimated purity ≥10% were selected. DNA was extracted from tissue shav­
ings of frozen tissue or 1-mm core-punch biopsies (Miltex, 33-31AA-P/25) 
from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and from buffy coat prepara­
tions of paired blood using standard techniques (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). 
The DNA was then quantified using PicoGreen dye (InVitrogen, Carlsbad 
CA). Mass spectrometric genotyping with a well-established 48-SNP 
panel was used to confirm the identity of tumor-normal pairs (Sequenom, 
San Diego, CA)36.
Whole-exome sequencing and analyses. Whole-exome sequencing was 
performed as previously described15. In brief, DNA was fragmented by 
sonication (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA) to 150 bp and further purified using 
Agencourt AMPure XP beads. 50 ng of size-selected DNA was then ligated to 
specific adaptors during library preparation (Illumina TruSeq, Illumina Inc., 
San Diego, CA). Each library was made with sample-specific barcodes and 
quantified by quantitative PCR (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA), and 
two libraries were pooled to a total of 500 ng for exome enrichment using the 
Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit (Whole Exome_v2 and Whole Exome_v4, 
44 Mb; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Several captures were pooled 
further and sequenced in one or more lanes to a final equivalent of two exomes 
per lane on a HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA).
Read pairs were aligned to the hg19 reference sequence using the Burrows-
Wheeler Aligner37, and sample reads were demultiplexed using Picard tools. 
Data were sorted and duplicate-marked using SAMtools and Picard. Bias in 
base quality score assignments due to flowcell, lane, dinucleotide context and 
machine cycle were analyzed and recalibrated, and local realignment around 
insertions or deletions (indels) was achieved using the Genome Analysis 
Toolkit (GATK)38,39. Somatic variant calling was performed within the 
Firehose environment40 using MuTect13. All sample pairs passed a quality-
control pipeline to test for any tumor-normal and interindividual mixups 
by comparing insert-size distribution and copy-number profile as described 
previously41.
Somatic mutations and short indels were called and post filtered using 
MuTect13 and IndelLocator40,41. These were annotated to genes and compared 
to events in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) using 
Oncotator, and spurious calls caused by mismapping and other previously 
identified systematic errors were removed using an established list of known 
problematic sites15,40,42,43. MutSig14 was used to determine the significance 
of mutated genes. MutSig compares observed mutations against expected 
sequence-specific, context-specific, tumor-specific and gene-specific back­
ground mutation frequencies. Additionally MutSig prioritizes mutations 
that are positionally clustered or occur in highly conserved regions40,42,43. 
We analyzed mutational spectra and rates across multiple tumor types using 
previously described methods14.
Mutation clonality analysis. To assess whether mutations are clonal (i.e., 
present in all cancer cells), we assessed the CCF of each mutation, as 
described in Carter et al.44. Mutations for which the CCF is close to 1 are 
considered clonal. Those mutations with lower probable CCFs are con­
sidered subclonal. To determine the CCF, we first calculated the sample 
purity (i.e., the percentage of tumor cells in our sample) by constructing 
the probability density function for the allele fractions of mutations. Using 
that information, we then identified a clonal heterozygous peak at or below 
0.5 allele fraction:

where af is the true allele fraction between 0 and 1, alt is the alternate allele 
counts, ref is the reference allele counts and m is the index for mutation 
count44. We assumed that the local copy number at each mutation is 2 for 
craniopharyngioma and that each tumor has heterozygous clonal mutations 
that are sufficient to form a peak45,46. Given these assumptions, the purity is 
the peak af × 2.
Once we estimated tumor purity, we then estimated the CCF for each muta­
tion. The CCF is the percentage of tumor cells harboring a given mutation. 
Clonal mutations have a true CCF of 1, and subclonal mutations have a true 
CCF <1. The observed allele counts correspond to a probability density of the 
CCF, which can be estimated with the following equation:44

where CN(m) is the local copy number at the given mutation m, and CCF 
ranges from 0 to 1. The probability for any allele fraction greater than the 
maximum CCF allowed was folded back to a CCF of 1. We again assumed a 
copy number of 2 (refs. 26,27). We also considered the possibility that the site 
is homozygous in both copies of the chromosome (loss of heterozygosity) by 
multiplying the CCF by 2 in the equation above and chose the solution with 
the highest peak probability. The CCF formulation is approximately equivalent 
to ABSOLUTE44. The pdfs also provided a direct estimate of the confidence 
intervals on CCF. Each mutation was classified as clonal or subclonal on the 
basis of the probability that the CCF exceeded 0.80. A probability threshold 
of 0.5 was used throughout for this classification47.
Validation of candidate mutations by Sequenom genotyping and SNaPshot. 
We validated all of the common mutations in BRAF and CTNNB1 by mass 
spectrometric genotyping based on the Sequenom MassARRAY tech­
nology (Sequenom Inc, San Diego, CA) using a multibase homogenous 
Mass-Extend (hME) as previously described35,48. The complete hME assay 
list is provided in Supplementary Table 3. A second targeted sequencing 
platform (SNaPshot genotyping) was performed as previously described 
to validate the BRAF p.Val600Glu (c.1799T>A) alteration in all papillary 
craniopharyngiomas33,49,50.
IHC. We performed immunohistochemical studies on 5-µm-thick whole-
tissue sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue in a Bond 3 automated 
immunostainer (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL, USA) using a primary 
antibody against BRAF p.Val600Glu (clone VE1, 1:100, Spring Bioscience, 
Pleasanton, CA) and a primary antibody against β-catenin (see below). 
For BRAF p.Val600Glu, we deparaffinized the sections on the Leica Bond 
using Bond Dewax solution and performed antigen retrieval with an 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid–based solution (Leica) at pH 9 and a Leica 
Polymer Refine kit for DAB (diaminobenzidine) staining. Appropriate positive 
and negative controls were included. Positive staining was characterized by 
diffuse and moderate cytoplasmic staining of the tumor cells. We considered 
isolated nuclear staining, weak staining of occasional cells or faint diffuse staining 
as negative staining. For β-catenin (BD Pharmingen, 610154, mouse monoclonal, 
clone 14), antigen retrieval was performed in a pressure cooker in citrate buffer 
(pH 6.0, 1:1,000 dilution) with a 45-min incubation followed by Dako anti-mouse 
horseradish peroxidase for 30 min at room temperature. Cases with nuclear 
staining (which ranged from low level to high level) were scored as positive, and 
cases with membranous staining were scored as negative.
