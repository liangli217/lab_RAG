Recent studies indicate that a subclass of APOBEC cytidine 
deaminases, which convert cytosine to uracil during RNA 
editing and retrovirus or retrotransposon restriction, may 
induce mutation clusters in human tumors. We show here that 
throughout cancer genomes APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis is 
pervasive and correlates with APOBEC mRNA levels. Mutation 
clusters in whole-genome and exome data sets conformed 
to the stringent criteria indicative of an APOBEC mutation 
pattern. Applying these criteria to 954,247 mutations in 2,680 
exomes from 14 cancer types, mostly from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA), showed a significant presence of the APOBEC 
mutation pattern in bladder, cervical, breast, head and neck, 
and lung cancers, reaching 68% of all mutations in some 
samples. Within breast cancer, the HER2-enriched subtype 
was clearly enriched for tumors with the APOBEC mutation 
pattern, suggesting that this type of mutagenesis is functionally 
linked with cancer development. The APOBEC mutation 
pattern also extended to cancer-associated genes, implying that 
ubiquitous APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis is carcinogenic.
Genome instability triggers the development of many types of 
cancers1,2. Radiation and chemical damage are traditionally invoked 
as culprits in theories of carcinogenic mutagenesis3. However, 
normal enzymatic activities can also be a source of DNA damage 
and mutation. Cytidine deaminases, which convert cytosine bases 
to uracil, likely contribute to DNA damage4. Activation-induced 
cytidine deaminase (AID), a key enzyme in adaptive immunity, not 
only initiates the hypermutation and class-switch recombination of 
immunoglobulin genes but also can mutate chromosomal DNA at 
a limited number of secondary targets, some of which have been 
implicated in carcinogenesis5. In addition to AID, the human genome 
encodes several homologous APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA-
editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) cytidine deaminases that 
function in innate immunity as well as in RNA editing6. Previous 
human cell culture studies showed that a subclass of APOBECs with 
mutational specificity for TC motifs (with the mutated base under­
lined) is capable of inducing mutations in chromosomal and mito­
chondrial DNA and therefore could have a role in carcinogenesis7–9. 
(APOBEC without the gene-specifying suffix is used hereafter to 
designate a subclass of cytidine deaminases with TC motif specificity. 
Note that, on the basis of motif specificity, APOBEC3G and AID do 
not fall into this subclass.) Supporting a role for APOBECs in cancer, 
a mutation signature consistent with APOBEC editing was found in 
individual cancer-related genes10,11. Recently, clustered mutations 
(termed kataegis in ref. 12) identified through next-generation 
sequencing suggested that APOBECs can induce base substitutions 
in tumor genomes12,13. Clustered mutations showed even higher pref­
erence for a more stringent TCW motif (where W corresponds to 
either A or T). Tightly linked strand-coordinated clustered mutations 
(clusters whose mutations all occur at one type of nucleotide) were 
often colocalized with rearrangement breakpoints, suggesting that this 
mutagenesis results from aberrant DNA double-strand break (DSB) 
repair that produces single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), an ideal substrate 
for the APOBEC enzymes6. The frequency of base substitutions in the 
APOBEC motif was higher for clustered mutations identified in whole 
genome–sequenced breast cancers12, as well as in multiple myeloma, 
prostate, and head and neck cancers13. Notably, non-clustered sub­
stitutions in the TCW motif occurred near rearrangement breakpoints 
more frequently than expected by random chance across the genomes 
of several cancer types14. Analysis of breast cancer sequencing and 
expression data suggested that it is specifically APOBEC3B that causes 
mutations in this cancer type9.
Despite the indication that APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis may 
have a role in cancer, it was unclear how strong of a mutagenic factor 
APOBEC enzymes are, whether APOBEC mutagenesis is a ubiqui­
tous characteristic of many cancer types and cases, and whether it 
is associated with any specific tumor characteristics. Here we have 
developed an analysis to evaluate the strength of the APOBEC muta­
tion pattern in individual samples from multiple whole-genome and 
exome mutation data sets, such as TCGA. We found that the APOBEC 
mutation pattern is prominent and even prevailing in many samples

RESULTS
A pattern for detecting APOBEC mutagenesis
Our approach to the statistical exploration of complex mutation spec­
tra in multiple cancer samples involved the formulation of a single 
hypothesis surrounding a diagnostic mutation pattern, which uses 
knowledge obtained in previous experiments as well as in data ana­
lyses and minimizes overlap with other known sequence-specific 
mutagenesis mechanisms. The first step in defining a measure for a 
pattern of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis in a cancer sample was 
to find mutations that occurred in the motif most likely to be an 
APOBEC-specific target. We chose the TCW motif instead of the 
less stringent TC motif because of its demonstrated prevalence in 
mutagenesis caused by some APOBECs in model systems as well as 
in mutation clusters found in cancers (refs. 9,12,13 and references 
therein). The more stringent TCW motif also eliminated potential 
overlap with sequence-specific mutagenesis in highly mutable CpG 
sequences that would occasionally be preceded by a thymine. Second, 
we proposed that APOBEC-induced mutagenesis would involve pri­
marily cytosine-to-guanine and/or cytosine-to-thymine substitutions, 
with rare ­cytosine-to-adenine changes. This substitution pattern is 
based on the tendency of translesion synthesis to misincorporate 
cytosine or adenine bases across from abasic sites (resulting in 
cytosine-to-guanine and cytosine-to-thymine mutations) that are 
generated frequently by the activity of uracil DNA glycosylase15–17 
toward the products of both spontaneous and APOBEC-induced cyto­
sine deamination, as well as copying a cytosine deamination–derived 
uracil (resulting in cytosine-to-thymine changes). Thus, in the present 
analysis, we defined cytosine-to-thymine and cytosine-to-guanine 
substitutions in TCW motifs as APOBEC signature mutations. To 
identify samples that experienced APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, 
we further defined an APOBEC mutagenesis pattern within a sample 
as a statistically significant enrichment of the frequency of APOBEC 
signature mutations compared to that expected with random muta­
genesis (Online Methods). Enrichment for APOBEC signature muta­
tions (TCW to TTW or TGW and the complementary WGA to WAA 
or WCA changes) among all similar mutations of cytosine or guanine 
bases (cytosine to thymine or guanine and guanine to adenine or 
cytosine) was calculated relative to the frequency of the APOBEC 
mutation motif (TCW or WGA) in the 41-nucleotide regions centered 
on the mutated bases. We used only the nucleotides immediately sur­
rounding the mutations in this calculation because APOBEC enzymes 
are thought to scan a limited area of ssDNA to deaminate a cytosine in 
a preferred motif18,19. This approach does not exclude any given area 
of the genome in general, but rather uses the areas within each sample 
where mutagenesis has happened, and then evaluates whether the 
mutagenesis in this sample was enriched for APOBEC signature muta­
tions. To test the accuracy of our analysis, we compared our measure 
of the APOBEC mutation pattern (fold enrichment) to a previously 
reported measure of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis obtained via a 
very different approach involving the mathematical decomposition 
and extraction of multiple mutation signatures from 21 breast cancer 
samples12. The results showed a very high level of correlation between 
the measures (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1), 
supporting the applicability of our method. Moreover, our analysis 
remained robust even when applied to samples containing small 
numbers of mutations. The fold enrichment of APOBEC-­mediated 
mutations in a subset of mutations representing exomes from the 
aforementioned 21 breast cancers (~2% of total mutations in the 
whole genome) correlated strongly with values obtained from the 
entire genome (Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting that our analysis 
may be effectively applied to mutations identified through exome 
sequencing and would thereby substantially increase the number of 
cancer samples that are available for analysis.
An APOBEC mutagenesis pattern in mutation clusters
We evaluated the APOBEC mutation pattern in a large number of 
whole-genome and exome mutation data sets accumulated in TCGA 
as well as in several publications20,21. APOBECs are highly specific 
for ssDNA and are capable of simultaneously making multiple muta­
tions if an ssDNA region persists17,19. Such mutations are strand 
co­ordinated, as changes in multiple cytosines occur on the same DNA 
strand. We and others have detected this APOBEC mutation pattern 
in cytosine and complementary guanine strand-coordinated clusters 
from a limited number of whole genome–sequenced tumors12,13. 
These clusters often colocalize with rearrangement breakpoints12,13 
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3), which agrees with mutagenesis 
occurring in ssDNA regions that are either prone to breakage and/or 
are formed during a DSB repair process. Clustered cytosine or gua­
nine mutations identified previously13 as well as in additional analysis 
of whole genome–sequenced colorectal adenocarcinomas22 presented 
here showed a strong APOBEC mutation pattern (with the highest 
enrichment observed for the TCW motif and strong preference for 
cytosine-to-thymine and cytosine-to-guanine changes in this motif; 
Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2).
We next addressed whether an APOBEC mutation pattern is com­
mon among different cancer samples and types. We accumulated lists 
of cancer-specific mutations from the whole-exome sequencing of 
2,680 tumors, mostly by the TCGA Research Network (Supplementary 
Table 3). Although exome sequencing substantially increases the 
number of samples available for analysis, its general specificity for 
­protein-coding regions results in only ~1% of total genomic DNA being 
assessed. In identifying clusters from exome sequencing, we therefore 
estimated the total mutation load in a given tumor sample under the 
assumption that exome mutations constitute 1% of mutations in the 
entire genome, using this value to identify clusters with our previously 
described algorithm13. This method found 498 total clusters in the 
2,680 sequenced exomes from 14 different cancer types. In total, 218 
cytosine- or guanine-coordinated clusters were identified, occurring 
in every cancer type analyzed except acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) 
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Similar to results obtained by whole-genome 
analysis (compare Figs. 1a and 1b), these clusters showed a robust 
APOBEC mutation pattern, whereas other known mutagenic motifs 
involving cytosine or guanine nucleotides were depleted. In contrast, 
the APOBEC mutation pattern was barely detectable or was unde­
tectable in non-coordinated clustered cytosine and guanine muta­
tions and scattered mutations, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5). 
The enrichment of APOBEC signature mutations in cytosine- or 
guanine-­coordinated clusters was more pronounced in clusters with 
>2 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 4) because clusters with only 2 
mutations had a higher chance of occurring independently through 
non-APOBEC-dependent mechanisms.
The APOBEC mutagenesis pattern across 2,680 cancer exomes
The strength of the APOBEC mutation pattern in cytosine- or 
­guanine-coordinated clusters from our analysis of exome mutations 
(Fig. 1b) was comparable to that of clusters found in whole-genome 
mutation lists (Fig. 1a), suggesting that exome-wide mutation data

may be sufficient to detect the APOBEC mutation pattern among 
all mutations in a sample’s exome. Indeed, the APOBEC mutation 
pattern was clearly present throughout many exomes, indicating 
that APOBEC enzymes were probably a major source of mutagen­
esis in these samples (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 4). Samples 
showing the APOBEC mutation pattern occurred primarily in six 
cancer types, whereas the other eight cancer types were depleted of 
this pattern, despite high general mutation rates in many samples 
(P < 0.0001, two-sided χ2 comparison of the number of samples in each 
cancer type showing fold enrichment of APOBEC signature mutations 
greater than the median fold enrichment for all samples; n = 2,680). 
Bladder (BLCA), cervical (CESC), head and neck (HNSC), breast 
(BRCA) and lung cancers (LUAD and LUSC) were enriched in sam­
ples with a high level of APOBEC mutagenesis or having greater odds 
ratios compared to those for the total range of APOBEC-mediated 
mutagenesis in exomes (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). Motif-
specific functional selection is unlikely to have caused the observed 
over-representation of the APOBEC mutation pattern, as correspond­
ing calculations of fold enrichment for silent and noncoding muta­
tions in each sample produced similar results (Supplementary Fig. 7). 
Across all tumors analyzed, high fold enrichment of APOBEC muta­
tions correlated strongly with decreased Fisher’s q value as well as 
with an increase in the fraction of total mutations in a tumor that 
had the APOBEC signature (Supplementary Fig. 8). In individual 
tumors with a strong APOBEC pattern, the number of APOBEC sig­
nature mutations was often large, making the APOBEC enzyme the 
predominant source of mutations in the sample (Fig. 2b). Notably, 
some samples contained over a thousand APOBEC signature muta­
tions, constituting up to 68% of mutations in the exome.
In cancer types where an APOBEC mutation pattern was not notice­
able in the exome data, the pattern was detectable in clusters of strand-
coordinated cytosine (or guanine) mutations from whole-genome 
data. Whole-genome data contained about 100-fold more mutations 
than exome data, facilitating the detection of clusters. We previously 
reported such clusters to be enriched for the APOBEC mutation pat­
tern when considering the mutations in whole genome–sequenced 
prostate carcinomas13, and we show here the same pattern in nine 
whole-genome colorectal cancer mutation data sets22 (Supplementary 
Fig. 3). In each of these data sets, many of the cytosine- or guanine-
coordinated clusters colocalized with chromosomal rearrangement 
breakpoints, a phenomenon that supports the involvement of ssDNA 
(the exclusive substrate of APOBEC enzymes) in cluster forma­
tion23,24. Neither cancer type, however, showed a detectable presence 
of the APOBEC mutation pattern in exome data. Thus, the APOBEC 
mutagenesis pattern seems to be ubiquitous at a background level in 
all types of cancer but is more prominent in particular types.
APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis correlates with APOBEC mRNA
Several cancer type–specific factors, including the availability of 
ssDNA substrate and the expression level of APOBEC enzymes, could 
contribute to the extent of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis. Recently, 
a tumor-specific increase in the transcription of APOBEC3B, deter­
mined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and microarray analysis, as well as 
by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), in breast cancer samples was shown 
to correlate with an increased number of cytosine-to-thymine transi­
tions9. Cytosine-to-thymine mutations are a relaxed measure of total 
deamination, which includes both the APOBEC signature in TCW 
defined in our analysis as well as mutations stemming from other 
processes. We used RNA-seq expression data to address whether 
the expression of any of the eight APOBEC enzymes known to have 
biochemical deamination activity toward DNA correlated with the 
observed extent of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis. Consistent 
with the previous report in breast cancer, APOBEC3B expression 
was frequently higher in tumor samples compared to matched 
normal samples; however, median expression of APOBEC3H and 
APOBEC3A (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10) was also higher by 
approximately twofold in tumors. Of the 483 breast cancers analyzed 
for both APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis and APOBEC expres­
sion, APOBEC3B as well as APOBEC3A mRNA levels correlated 
strongly with the total number of cytosine-to-thymine mutations per 
exome (Supplementary Fig. 11a; Spearman’s r = 0.233, Bonferroni-
­corrected q < 0.001 and Spearman’s r = 0.1998, Bonferroni-­corrected 
q < 0.001, respectively). Notably, when transcript levels were com­
pared to the number of mutations conforming to our stringent 
definition of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis (TCW to TTW or 
TGW), the strength of the association was higher for both enzymes 
(Fig. 3a; Spearman’s r = 0.3150, Bonferroni-corrected q < 0.001 and

Spearman’s r = 0.3088, Bonferroni-corrected q < 0.001 for APOBEC3B 
and APOBEC3A, respectively). Extending this analysis to all 2,048 
tumors with available RNA-seq data across cancer types, expression 
of APOBEC3B again most strongly ­correlated with the number of 
TCW-to-TTW and TCW-to-TGW mutations per exome (Fig. 3a and 
Supplementary Table 4; Spearman’s r = 0.2953, Bonferroni-corrected 
q < 0.001), with APOBEC1, APOBEC3A, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G 
levels also associated, but to lesser extents (Supplementary Fig. 11b). 
Within individual cancer types, only APOBEC3A in breast cancer and 
APOBEC3B in breast cancer and lung adenocarcinomas showed a 
positive correlation between their expression and APOBEC-­mediated 
mutagenesis (Supplementary Fig. 11b). However, in bladder and 
lung squamous cell cancers—the remaining 2 cancer types with 
available RNA-seq data and high APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis—
median APOBEC3B expression was elevated by ~3-fold compared 
to the median of APOBEC3B expression in all samples (Bonferroni-
­corrected Mann-Whitney q < 0.001) (Fig. 3b). Thus, the APOBEC3B 
enzyme is probably the major candidate inducing the APOBEC muta­
tion pattern across cancer types.
HER2E breast cancers are enriched for APOBEC mutagenesis
Several cancer types showed high levels of the APOBEC mutation 
pattern as well as a wide variation among individual samples, which 
could reflect different biological pathways leading to carcinogenesis. 
The greatest range of variation was observed in breast cancer, which 
is often divided into subtypes on the basis of differences in biomedical 
characteristics (see ref. 25 and references therein). To determine 
whether the APOBEC mutagenesis pattern is associated with specific 
breast cancer subtypes, we divided the samples on the basis of their 
PAM50 classification as presented in ref. 25. The PAM50 algorithm 
uses the mRNA levels of 50 differentially expressed genes to classify 
breast cancers into specific subtypes26. Four subtypes—﻿­luminal 
A (Lum A), luminal B (Lum B), basal-like and HER2 enriched 
(HER2E)—were well represented in our data set. Each subtype 
contained samples with a prominent APOBEC mutation pattern 
and a correspondingly large number of APOBEC signature muta­
tions. However, such samples were unevenly distributed among the 
subtypes, occurring much more frequently in the HER2-enriched 
class (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 12).
Unlike in breast cancer as a whole (Fig. 3a), no correlation between 
the number of APOBEC signature mutations and APOBEC mRNA 
levels was observed in the HER2-enriched subtype (Supplementary 
Fig. 13a). This finding could result from consistently high APOBEC3B 
expression in HER2-enriched samples (~3-fold greater than the 
median expression across all cancer types), which reduces the power 
of correlation analysis (Supplementary Fig. 13b). Notably, basal-like 
and luminal B cancers also had median APOBEC3B expression levels 
comparable to that of HER2-enriched cancers but showed signifi­
cantly less APOBEC mutagenesis, suggesting that additional factors 
are likely as important as APOBEC expression.
The HER2-enriched subtype is reportedly associated not only 
with the amplification of the ERBB2 gene locus but also with a 
high level of copy number variation (CNV) across the genome25. 
This feature, as well as frequent colocalization of APOBEC sig­
nature mutations with chromosome rearrangements, suggested 
that a direct connection might exist between enrichment with the 
APOBEC mutagenesis signature and the number of segmental 
CNVs (CNVs originating from breakage). As shown in cell culture 
experiments27, increased APOBEC-induced deamination can lead 
to higher levels of breakage, which in turn could result in greater 
numbers of CNVs. Alternatively, increased breakage could provide 
more ssDNA substrate for APOBEC deamination. However, com­
parison of the number of segmental CNV breakpoints with the fold 
enrichment of APOBEC signature mutations in 449 breast cancer 
samples did not show any correlation (Supplementary Fig. 14). 
Although the underlying reason for the enrichment of the APOBEC 
mutagenesis pattern in the HER2-enriched subtype remains unclear, 
the association of this mutagenesis with a specific breast cancer 
subtype suggests that physiological aspects of this subtype are 
probably relevant.

The APOBEC mutagenesis pattern includes cancer driver genes
An APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis pattern present in a sample or 
group of samples indicates that the level of this mutagenesis is sig­
nificantly higher than expected if all base substitutions in cytosine 
(or guanine) bases have occurred randomly. However, because of the 
sequence specificity of APOBEC-catalyzed deamination and its tight 
association with ssDNA, the fraction of the genome where carcino­
genic mutations can occur may escape the bulk of APOBEC-­mediated 
mutagenesis. We therefore examined the overlap of APOBEC sig­
nature mutations with mutations that are potentially cancer driv­
ers. Three approaches were used to identify driver mutations. First, 
a stringent list of probable cancer driver mutations was assembled 
using the online software package CRAVAT28,29. On the basis of 
multiple parameters, including the occurrence of a mutation in the 
Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database30, 
this software calculated a probability that a given missense mutation 
drives cancer. Mutations having false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected 
q values of 0.05 or less were selected as likely drivers. We subsequently 
employed two additional ‘less stringent’ criteria to identify potentially 
­carcinogenic mutations, selecting for (i) mutations that were present 
in the COSMIC database (as indicated by CRAVAT) and (ii) muta­
tions that affected a subset of genes from the Cancer Gene Census—
genes in which missense or nonsense mutations are considered 
causative in cancer31. Both of these less stringent definitions of driver 
mutations extended the spectrum of changes beyond missense muta­
tions to include nonsense and synonymous mutations as potentially 
carcinogenic alterations31,32.
Using any of these three criteria, APOBEC signature mutations 
occurred at a higher frequency among carcinogenic mutations in 
the group of samples with high APOBEC presence compared to 
samples in which the APOBEC mutation pattern was not detected

Figure 3  APOBEC mRNA levels positively correlate with the number of 
APOBEC signature mutations. RNA-seq–derived mRNA levels for each 
APOBEC family member with documented deaminase activity on DNA 
were standardized relative to the levels of TBP (encoding TATA-binding 
protein). APOBEC mutations refers to the number of TCW-to-TTW and 
TCW-to-TGW changes. (a) Expression (relative to TBP) of APOBEC3A and 
APOBEC3B was compared to the total number of APOBEC mutations 
in each exome (blue circles) in 483 breast cancers (BRCA) and in all 
2,048 tumor samples (all) with available RNA-seq data by non-parametric 
Spearman’s correlation. Graphs show log-transformed values with 
mutation values augmented by 0.5 to allow depiction of exomes with 
no observed APOBEC signature mutations. Spearman’s coefficients and

(Fig. 5). This implies that APOBEC signature mutations themselves 
can contribute to carcinogenesis in samples with a strong APOBEC 
mutation pattern. Further supporting this carcinogenic poten­
tial, many of the APOBEC signature mutations that are also driver 
mutations in CRAVAT occurred in genes that are highly mutated in 
the COSMIC database and are present in the Cancer Gene Census 
(Supplementary Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Determining the mutagenic factors that underlie the mix of mutations 
in tumors is important for a general understanding of carcinogenesis. 
However, this analysis is daunting, as it often requires the testing of 
numerous poorly defined hypotheses. Here we have developed a single 
detailed hypothesis—that APOBEC cytidine deaminases are a signifi­
cant source of mutagenesis in human cancer genomes. This hypothesis 
is based on knowledge of the sequence- and single-strand specificity of 
APOBEC enzymes, their capacity to generate strand-coordinated muta­
tion clusters in model systems and the extensive correlation between 
experimentally determined APOBEC mutagenesis patterns and the 
patterns of mutations in strand-coordinated clusters found in cancers. 
Although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that another muta­
genic factor might closely mimic both the motif and mutagenic specifi­
cities of the APOBEC mutation pattern, there is yet no indication that 
such a factor exists. Furthermore, our observed correlation between 
the APOBEC mutagenesis pattern and APOBEC expression in cancer 
samples provides strong support for our hypothesis. Additional support 
could be sought by analyzing correlations with the germline genotypes 
of patients, as soon as such information would be available.
Our TCGA-based analysis indicates a widespread APOBEC muta­
genesis pattern and suggests that this pattern is associated with 
­biological mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis. With our approach, 
we establish a resource for identifying this pattern in the rapidly grow­
ing TCGA database as well as in other databases of genome- or exome-
wide mutations in humans. In addition, the predominance of APOBEC 
signature mutations across tumors of multiple cancer types underscores 
the importance of validating the specific APOBEC proteins responsible 
for mutagenesis and evaluating the presence of this mutagenesis in 
other types and subtypes of cancers, the stage(s) of cancer development 
that are most prone to APOBEC mutagenesis and the relative impact 
of this mutagenesis on genome changes that lead to cancer.
Multiple mechanisms could facilitate APOBEC-mediated muta­
genesis. Environmental and physiological factors might trigger and/
or support mutagenesis by (i) affecting the cellular abundance or 
activity of APOBEC proteins, (ii) altering access to nuclear DNA and 
(iii) increasing the amount and/or persistence of ssDNA substrates 
for APOBEC-mediated cytidine deamination. Our study and previ­
ous analyses suggest that the level of APOBEC3B transcription affects 
APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis. How higher APOBEC3B transcript 
levels are established remains unclear. Among the factors that could 
increase the amount of APOBEC protein(s) is the presence of the viral 
and retrotransposable elements that these enzymes restrict6,33. Such 
factors can stimulate APOBEC expression through a complex network 
of innate immunity signaling, involving components such as Toll-like 
receptors, interferons, interleukins and even the ‘usual suspect’ in car­
cinogenesis, the p53 protein34–37. Infection with several viruses38 as 
well as retrotransposition39 are associated with carcinogenesis; how­
ever, the mechanisms of this association are far from clear. A poten­
tial relationship between APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis and viral 
infection is appealing, as cervical and head and neck cancers, which 
are highly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, 
showed strong enrichment of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis.
Despite a positive correlation between APOBEC3B expression and 
APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, the extent of the association is rela­
tively small (Spearman’s r = 0.30). Thus, other factors probably con­
tribute more prominently to APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis. Factors 
that could increase the abundance and persistence of ssDNA include 
DNA-damaging agents40,41 as well as defects in DNA transactions that 
impede break repair42,43 and replication integrity44,45. Our work in 
yeast demonstrated that proliferation in the presence of an alkylation 
agent leads to the formation of ssDNA at DSB sites and dysfunctional 
forks and subsequently results in mutation clusters13. Notably, a high 
level of APOBEC-mediated deamination may in itself lead to DNA 
breakage27, which could generate a ssDNA substrate for APOBEC-
mediated hypermutation. It is generally acknowledged that carcino­
genesis requires the accumulation of multiple genetic changes46. As 
discussed in ref. 13, simultaneous mutations in scattered stretches 
of ssDNA formed at DSBs, replication forks and other cell contexts 
would be excellent substrates for APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, 
which in turn might produce multiple changes without excessive 
genome-wide mutation and provide a means to accumulate multiple 
carcinogenic mutations in a single or a few generations.

The fraction of potential cancer-driving mutations that have an APOBEC 
signature was determined for samples with high (q value for the 
enrichment of the APOBEC mutation pattern ≤ 0.05; Fig. 2) and low 
(q value > 0.05) presence of an exome-wide APOBEC mutation pattern. 
Mutations were designated as potential cancer drivers by one of three 
criteria: (i) Benjamini-Hochberg–corrected q value < 0.05 after CRAVAT 
analysis, (ii) listing within the COSMIC database and (iii) effect on a 
subset of genes in the Cancer Gene Census, whose alteration by missense 
or nonsense mutations can contribute to cancer. ***P < 0.0001 in a

provided for comparison. The specific mutated genes are presented in

ONLINE METHODS
Genome and exome data sets. Genome and exome data sets were obtained 
from publications20,21 or from the TCGA data portal (see URLs; Controlled 
Data Access HTTP Directory). The catalog of base substitutions identified 
by whole-genome sequencing in 21 breast cancers was downloaded from the 
website provided in ref. 12 (see URLs).
Hyperlinks to TCGA data sets and references to published mutation lists 
are provided in Supplementary Table 3.
Cluster analysis. Clusters and colocalization between clusters and rearrange­
ment breakpoints in whole-genome data sets were identified as described in 
ref. 13. Analysis of mutation clustering in exomes was conducted similarly to 
that in whole-genome data sets. Briefly, we first filtered out mutations identi­
cal to variants in dbSNP. These SNPs generally constituted a small percentage 
(0.9–12.1%) of all exome mutations for a given cancer type. However, LUSC, 
KIRC, PRAD and STAD samples contained somewhat higher numbers of 
mutations identical to variants in dbSNP (19.5–25.1%). Notably, each prefil­
tered mutation was included in the total number of mutations in the genome, 
which would thereby only increase the P values of clusters. We next identi­
fied groups of closely spaced mutations (with at most 10 nucleotides between 
neighbors), which we categorized as complex. Complex mutations are likely 
to arise from a mutagenesis event triggered by translesion synthesis across a 
single DNA lesion49,50. Each complex mutation was counted as a single muta­
tion event. Then, all groups of at least two mutations in which neighboring 
changes were separated by 10 kb or less were identified. The P value for each 
group was calculated under the assumption that all mutations were distributed 
randomly across the genome. The total number of mutations in the genome 
was estimated as 100-fold greater than the number of mutations in the exome, 
including those identical to variants in dbSNP.
A cluster P value was defined as the probability of observing k – 1 muta­
tions in x – 1 or fewer base pairs and was calculated using a negative binomial 
distribution as follows:

where x denotes the size of the mutation cluster (size is defined as the number 
of nucleotides in the region starting at the position of the first mutation and 
ending at the position of the last mutation of a cluster), k denotes the number

mutation at any random location in the genome calculated as
p = n
G
where n denotes the total number of mutations in a genome and G denotes the 
total genome size (number of nucleotides).
Groups of mutations were identified as clusters if the calculated P value was 
no greater than 1 × 10−4. A recursive algorithm was used, such that all clusters 
that met the P-value criterion were identified, even if they were part of a larger 
group that fit the spacing criterion but did not meet the probability cutoff. 
Individual mutations and clusters with P values no greater than 1 × 10−4 were 
classified as follows: clusters in which all mutations resulted from a change of 
the same kind of nucleotide were defined as strand-coordinated clusters, and 
clusters containing mutations of at least two different kinds of bases were called 
non-coordinated clusters. Mutations that did not belong to a cluster were clas­
sified as scattered, and the other category was named clustered.

(or WGA) motifs within the 41-nucleotides region centered on the mutated 
cytosines (and guanines) and contextC (or G) is the total number of cytosines 
(or guanines) within the area 41-nucleotides region centered on the mutated 
cytosines (or guanines).
In determining the presence of the APOBEC mutagenesis pattern, 
enrichment was calculated as above, except that only specific base substi­tutions 
(TCW to TTW or TGW, WGA to WAA or WCA, C to T or G, and G to A 
or C) were included.
Fisher’s exact test. Statistical evaluation of the over-representation of 
APOBEC signature mutations in each sample was performed using a one-sided 
Fisher’s exact test comparing the ratio of the number of cytosine-to-thymine 
or cytosine-to-guanine substitutions and guanine-to-adenine or guanine-
to-cytosine substitutions that occurred in and out of the APOBEC target motif 
(TCW or WGA) to an analogous ratio for all cytosines and guanines that reside 
inside and outside of the TCW or WGA motif within a sample fraction of the 
genome. P values calculated for multiple samples or multiple comparisons were 
corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method or the Bonferroni method as 
indicated51. Only corrected q values of <0.05 were considered significant.
Determining the number of breakpoints associated with segmental CNVs. 
The number of breakpoints associated with segmental CNVs was determined 
on the basis of TCGA Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 
analysis of 449 breast cancer (BRCA) samples. Breakpoints were identified 
as pairs of adjacent segments on the same chromosome with a difference in 
copy ratio of >0.1. Any segments with fewer than five probes were removed 
from analysis as being likely due to technical noise.
Defining cancer driver mutations. The online software package CRAVAT28,29 
(see URLs) was used to identify potential cancer-driving mutations among 
missense mutations. For acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), breast (BRCA), 
colorectal (COAD), ovarian (OV), rectal (READ), stomach (STAD) and uterine 
endometrial (UCEC) cancers, the matched tissue-specific passenger mutation 
profile provided in the CRAVAT package was used. For all other cancer types 
for which a tissue-specific profile was unavailable, a generic profile was used. 
CRAVAT outputs included a CHASM score, a P value indicating the likeli­
hood of a mutation being a driver and a Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) q value 
to correct for multiple-hypothesis testing. In our analysis, potential cancer 
drivers were identified as those mutations with a Benjamini-Hochberg q value 
no greater than 0.05. In addition to CRAVAT analysis, two other metrics to 
identify driver mutations were considered: the occurrence of mutations in the 
COSMIC database and alteration of genes listed in the Cancer Gene Census31, 
a curated list of genes whose alteration has been shown to be causative in 
at least some cancers. For the latter metric, only genes in the Cancer Gene 
Census where missense and nonsense mutations are known to be involved in 
carcinogenesis were used to identify potential drivers.
Analysis of controlled-access data. The complete list of analyzed mutations 
used to create all figures and make conclusions in this paper will be submitted 
as a TCGA substudy and will be available through controlled access to dbGaP 
study phs000178.v8.p7. The file will be in TCGA MAF format. In addition to 
the information from the original TCGA MAFs (Supplementary Table 3), 
the file will contain the results of mutation cluster analysis, sequence context 
of mutations and CRAVAT analysis. Before the acceptance of the substudy by 
TCGA, the file will be available to investigators after they acquire access to 
controlled TCGA data levels in coordination with D.A.G.
