Breast carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in
women worldwide, with an estimated 1.38 million new cases and
458,000 deaths in 2008 alone1. This malignancy represents a
heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular fea-
tures, prognosis and responses to available therapy2–4. Recurrent
somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described, including
mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifica-
tions, the first successful therapy target defined by a genomic aber-
ration5. Previous DNA sequencing studies of breast cancer genomes
have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene rearrange-
ments6–10. Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from
103 human breast cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in
Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal DNA, together
with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs.
Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA11,
TP536, AKT112, GATA313 and MAP3K110, we discovered recurrent
mutationsin the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletionsofits
partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent
MAGI3–AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer
lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expres-
sion. The MAGI3–AKT3 fusion leads to constitutive activation
of AKT kinase, which is abolished by treatment with an ATP-
competitive AKT small-molecule inhibitor.
Breast cancers are classified according to gene-expression subtypes:
luminal A, luminal B, Her2-enriched (Her2 is also known as ERBB2),
and basal-like14. Luminal subtypes are associated with expression of
oestrogen and progesterone receptors and differentiated luminal epi-
thelial cell markers. The subtypes differ in genomic complexity, key
genetic alterations and clinical prognosis2–4,15. To discover genomic
alterations in breast cancers, we performed whole-genome and
whole-exome sequencing of 108 primary, treatment-naive, breast
carcinoma/normal DNA pairs from all major expression subtypes
(Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3), 17 cases by whole-exome
and whole-genome sequencing, 5 cases by whole-genome sequencing
alone, and 86 cases by whole-exome sequencing alone.
In total, whole-exome sequencing was performed on 103 tumour/
normal pairs, 54 from Mexico and 49 from Vietnam, targeting 189,980
exonscomprising33megabases (Mb)ofthegenomeand witha median
of 85.1% of targeted bases covered at least 30-fold acrossthe sampleset.
This analysis revealed a total of 4,985 candidate somatic substitutions
(see https://confluence.broadinstitute.org/display/CGATools/MuTect
for methods and data sets) and insertions/deletions (indels, see https://
confluence.broadinstitute.org/display/CGATools/Indelocator for methods)
in the target protein-coding regions and the adjacent splice sites,
ranging from 14 to 307 putative events in individual samples (Sup-
plementary Table 4). These mutations represented 3,153 missense,
1,157 silent, 242 nonsense, 97 splice site, 194 deletions, 110 insertions
and 32 other mutations (Supplementary Table 5). The total mutation
rate was 1.66 per Mb (range 0.47–10.5) with a non-silent mutation rate
of 1.27 per Mb (range 0.31–8.05), similar to previous reports in breast
carcinoma6–9. The mutation rate in breast cancer exceeds that of
haematologic malignancies and prostate cancer, but is significantly
lower than in lung cancer and melanoma10,16–19. The most common

mutation events observed are C to T transition events in CpG dinu-
cleotides (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4).
We performed validation experiments on 494 candidate mutations
(representing all significantly mutated genes and genes in significantly
mutated gene sets) using a combination of mass-spectrometric geno-
typing, 454 pyrosequencing, Pacific Biosciences sequencing and
Illumina sequencing of matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
tissue, and confirmed the presence of 94% of protein-altering point
mutations (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5); this
validation rate is consistent with previous results that 95% of point
mutations can be validated with orthogonal methods16,17. Only 18 out
of 39 (46%) indels among significantly mutated genes were confirmed.
Six genes were found to be mutated with significant recurrence in
the 103 whole-exome sequenced samples, by analysis with the MutSig
algorithm16,17 (https://confluence.broadinstitute.org/display/CGATools/
MutSig) at a false discovery rate (FDR) , 0.1 after correction for mul-
tiple hypothesis testing (Supplementary Table 6a), manual review of
reads, and subsequent orthogonal confirmation of somatic events
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 6). One gene, CBFB, is identified for
the first time as a significantly mutated gene in breast cancer or any
other epithelial cancer, to our knowledge, whereas the other five genes
(TP53, PIK3CA, AKT1, GATA3 and MAP3K1) have previously been
reported as mutated in breast cancer7,10,13. This significantly mutated
genes list, as any list produced by a statistical method, is probably
incomplete and reflects the statistical power of our cohort size—larger
sample sets will provide further statistical power.
Somatic mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA were each present in 27%
of samples, consistent with published frequencies10,20 (Fig. 1). TP53
mutations occur in samples with a higher mutation rate (t-test
P 5 0.0079 comparing samples with mutation rates greater than or
less than the median 1.66 mutations per Mb) and were distributed
across the gene in sites reported in COSMIC (http://www.sanger.ac.
uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/). Also, using the ABSOLUTE algorithm for
determining allele-specific copy number21, we observed that 21 out of
31 TP53 mutations were homozygous (Supplementary Table 4).
PIK3CA mutations were clustered in the helical (amino acids 542/
545; 40%) and kinase domains (amino acid 1047; 47%)20. Six samples
harboured the AKT1 E17K mutation that alters the pleckstrin-
homology (PH) domain and leads to activation of the kinase12.
AKT1 and PIK3CA mutations, which activate the phosphatidylinositol-
3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, were mutually exclusive in our data set.
MAP3K1, recently reported as mutated in oestrogen-receptor-positive
breast cancers10, harboured five mutations in three patients with
oestrogen-receptor-positive disease, and followed a pattern consistent
with positive selection for recessive inactivation of the gene. In total,
two frameshift, two nonsense and one missense mutation, combined
with a homozygous deletion spanning the coding region were
observed. Although the point mutations seemed to be heterozygous
by copy-number analysis, two patients harboured dual mutations,
consistent with compound heterozygous inactivation, although con-
firmatory phasing data were not available. The GATA3 transcription
factor gene harboured mutations in four patients with luminal
tumours, including three previously unknown frameshift mutations
near the 39-end of the coding sequence. We also identified one previ-
ously described splice-site mutation that disrupts zinc-finger domains
in GATA3 required for DNA binding13.
CBFB, encoding the core-binding-factor beta subunit, was mutated
in four oestrogen-receptor-positive samples, with one nonsense muta-
tion and three truncating frameshift mutations(Fig. 2a).CBFBsomatic
mutations have been noted in isolated cases of breast cancer6,10. This is
the first report of these mutations recurring at a significant rate above
background; the sample size is not sufficient to determine whether
these mutations are specific for oestrogen-receptor-positive subtypes.
CBFB encodes the non-DNA-binding component of a heterodimeric
protein complex, together with the DNA-binding RUNX proteins
encoded by RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3. Copy-number analysis,
using the ABSOLUTE algorithm21, provides further evidence for loss
of function of the RUNX1/CBFB complex in breast cancer: the cases
with CBFB mutations seem to have hemizygous deletions of one par-
ental allele, whereas two additional cases harbour homozygous dele-
tions of RUNX1 (Fig. 2b, c and Supplementary Figs 7 and 8).
Oncogenic rearrangements of RUNX1 or CBFB are common in acute
myeloid leukaemia22,23 (including the CBFB–MYH11 translocation
believed to have dominant negative function22). This is to our know-
ledge the first report of inactivation of this transcription factor com-
plex in epithelial cancers.

PIK3CA, TP53 and ERBB2, the latter below the significance threshold
in the complete analysis (Supplementary Table 7). ERBB2 contained
somatic mutations in three samples, with two being identical S310F
mutations (these two samples are distinct on the basis of their germline
and somatic genotypes). The S310F mutation can activate ERBB2 and
is transforming in vitro (personal communication from H. Greulich).
Neither sample with the S310F activating mutation has ERBB2
amplification (Supplementary Fig. 9). The two samples belong to the
Her2-enriched and luminal B subtypes, which typically have ERBB2
amplification; this supports the notion that the observed mutations
have a driving role in these tumours10,24.
To identify candidate genomic rearrangements, we applied the
dRanger algorithm16,17 to the 22 cases with paired tumour/normal
whole-genome sequencing data (Supplementary Table 8). The rate
of rearrangements ranged from a median of 30 rearrangements per
sample in the luminal A subtype (range 0–218) to the basal-like and
Her2-enriched subtypes with a median of 237 and 246 rearrange-
ments, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 10); the rates are similar to
a recent report15. We performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification on a subset of the candidate rearrangements (Sup-
plementary Methods) and confirmed 89 out of 165 events (54%). No
rearrangement was seen in more than one sample (Supplementary
Table 8). In addition, we did not identify rearrangements previously
observed by DNA sequencing15 nor by complementary DNA (cDNA)-
sequencing, including MAST and NOTCH family-gene fusions25.
The discovery of recurrent driver rearrangements in other epithelial
cancers26,27 led to a closer examination of the list of confirmed re-
arrangements. In a triple-negative, basal-like subtype tumour, we
observed a rearrangement between the genes MAGI3 (membrane-
associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain containing 3) on
chromosome 1p and AKT3 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene
homologue 3) on chromosome 1q, resulting in a balanced transloca-
tion from intron 9 in MAGI3 to intron 1 of AKT3 (Fig. 3a). The
previously unknown fusion genes were confirmed in tumour DNA
by sequencing the product of PCR amplification (Fig. 3b). The
MAGI3 disruption is complemented by a hemizygous deletion of the
other allele (Supplementary Fig. 11a). The expression levels of indi-
vidual exons of MAGI3 and AKT3 correspond to the predicted
CBFB mutations

59-MAGI3–AKT3-39 fusion (Supplementary Fig. 11b), with this
sample having the highest AKT3 expression in the data set.
Expression of the fusion gene was confirmed in the tumour sample
by PCR amplification of the cDNA (Fig. 3b).
The rearrangement produces an in-frame fusion gene with a predicted
MAGI3–AKT3 fusion protein that combines MAGI3 lacking the second
PDZ domain, reported to bind to PTEN and be required for the inhib-
itory effect of PTEN on the PI3K pathway28, together with an AKT3
region that retains an intact kinase domain but has a disruption of the
pleckstrinhomologydomainbeforetheglutamateatposition17(Fig.3c).
AKT3 shares significant homology to AKT1 and is reported to be the
dominant AKT family member expressed in hormone-receptor-negative
breast cancers29. Together, the MAGI3–AKT3 translocation and deletion
of MAGI3 could result in the combined loss of function of a tumour
suppressor gene (PTEN) and activation of an oncogene (AKT3).
To evaluate oncogenic activity of the MAGI3–AKT3 fusion, we
expressed the fusion gene ectopically in ZR-75 cells. The MAGI3–
AKT3 fusion protein is constitutively phosphorylated at serine 473
in the AKT3 kinase domain (numbered according to the wild-type
protein) in the absence of growth factors (Fig. 3d); ectopically
expressed AKT1 with an engineered E17K mutation is likewise con-
stitutively phosphorylated (Fig. 3d), as previously reported12. Con-
stitutive activation of the MAGI3–AKT3 kinase in turn activates
downstream pathways as demonstrated by phosphorylation of
GSK3b, an AKT substrate (Fig. 3d). Phosphorylation of GSK3b by
the MAGI3–AKT3 fusion can be inhibited with an ATP-competitive
small molecule AKT inhibitor, GSK-690693, but not with an allosteric
AKT inhibitor, MK-2206, that interacts with the PH domain of AKT
(Fig. 3d). Overexpression of the MAGI3–AKT3 fusion gene in Rat-1
fibroblast cell lines led to loss of contact inhibition and focus formation
(Fig. 3e).
We screened 235 additional breast cancer samples for the presence
of the 59-MAGI3–AKT3-39 fusion event by PCR with reverse tran-
scription (RT–PCR) of cDNA followed by Sanger sequencing of break-
points. The fusion was present in 8 of the 235 samples, including 5 out
of 72 triple-negative (oestrogen-receptor-, progesterone-receptor- and
Her2-negative) samples (Supplementary Fig. 12).
The power provided by whole-genome and whole-exome sequen-
cing of a relatively large and diverse breast cancer sample set has
enabled several significant discoveries, including the identification of
recurrent inactivating mutations in CBFB and of a recurrent transloca-
tion of MAGI3–AKT3. The mutations in CBFB, RUNX1 and GATA3
suggest the importance of understanding epithelial cell differentiation
and its regulatory transcription factors in breast cancer pathogenesis.
The recurrent genomic fusion involving AKT3 suggests that the use of
ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors should be evaluated in clinical trials
for the treatment of fusion-positive triple-negative breast cancers, a
subtype where limited therapeutic options exist beyond systemic cyto-
toxic chemotherapy.
METHODS SUMMARY
All samples were obtained under institutional IRB approval and with documented
informed consent. Breast cancer specimens from Mexico were paired with peri-
pheral blood normal DNA whereas the Vietnamese samples were paired with DNA
from normal adjacent breast tissue. Tumour RNA for each case was analysed on
exon arrays to determine breast cancer expression subtype using the PAM50 clas-
sification method, whereas tumour/normal DNA pairs were analysed for copy
number, allelic imbalance, and ancestry using single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) arrays. A total of 108 samples, 17 both whole-genome sequencing and
whole-exome sequencing, 86 whole-exome sequencing only, and 5 whole-genome
sequencing only, passed initial qualification metrics, library construction, and suc-
cessfully achieved desired sequencing depth (1003 whole-exome sequencing; 303
whole-genome sequencing) on the Illumina sequencing platform (Supplementary
Figs 1–3, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Tumour-specific point mutations, small
insertions/deletions (indels), and rearrangements were detected by comparing
tumour DNA to its paired normal DNA and using a series of algorithms to identify
somatic events (Supplementary Fig. 2)16,17. Additional mutation calling was per-
formed separately on tumour and normal DNA to identify germline mutation
events that may confer susceptibility to breast carcinoma. Allele-specific copy
number of each gene/mutation was determined using the HAPSEG and
ABSOLUTE analysis methods. Confirmation of point mutations and indels was
performed using mass-spectrometry-based genotyping and orthogonal next-
generation sequencing methods, whereas putative in-frame genomic rearrange-
ments were PCR-amplified from DNA to confirm the presence of the event.

Supplementary Information. Access to the data and computational algorithms
