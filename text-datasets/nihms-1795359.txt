Abstract
Background—Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) prevalence 
estimates are currently based on predominantly White study populations screened by serum 
protein electrophoresis/immunofixation (SPEP/IFX). A 3% MGUS prevalence is reported in 
the general population of European ancestry aged ≥50 years. MGUS prevalence is two times 
higher in individuals of African descent or with a family history of multiple myeloma (MM) 
related conditions. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical implications of monoclonal 
gammopathies (MG) in a high-risk population screened by quantitative mass spectrometry.
Methods—We used quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass 
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and EXENT-iQ software to screen for and quantify MG in serum

from 7,622 individuals who consented to the prospective PROMISE screening study between 
February 2019 and November 2021 and the Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB) between 
July 2010 and July 2021. 83% of participants were at high risk for developing an MG, based on 
Black ancestry or a family history of hematologic malignancies. Participants with a plasma cell 
malignancy diagnosed prior to screening were excluded. Longitudinal clinical data were available 
for MGBB participants with a median follow-up time from serum sample screening of 4.5 years 
(IQR, 2.4 to 6.7 years).
Findings—In our study cohort, the median age at time of screening was 56 years (range, 18 to 
95). 5,013 (66%) participants were female and 2,439 (32%) self-identified as Black. Using SPEP/
IFX, the MGUS prevalence was 6% in high-risk individuals aged ≥50. Using MS, we observed a 
>40% total MG prevalence in this group. We termed MGs below the current clinical IFX detection 
level (<0.2g/L) monoclonal gammopathy of indeterminate potential (MGIP), to differentiate them 
from higher-concentration MGs, termed MS-MGUS, which had a 13% prevalence by MS in high-
risk individuals aged ≥50. MGIP was predominantly of IgM isotype, and its prevalence increased 
with age. MS-MGUS prevalence increased with age and was higher in males and high-risk 
individuals. The monoclonal proteins at the MGIP level were confirmed by liquid chromatography 
mass spectrometry testing. Screen-detected MGs correlated with increased all-cause mortality 
(HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.16–2.08, P=0.003). All MGs were associated with an increased likelihood 
of comorbidities, including myocardial infarction (MGIP-High: OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.26–2.02, 
P=0.00016; MS-MGUS: OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.07–1.80, P=0.015).
Interpretation—MS-based screening detected an unprecedented high prevalence of MGs, 
including age-associated MGIP and more precise estimates of MS-MGUS compared to 
conventional gel-based methods. Results from our screening study with a novel technology 
yielded greater absolute prevalence rates with similar relative differences across risk groups 
compared to conventional methods. The use of MS for the detection and quantification MG 
including lower-level ones highlighted their potential hidden clinical significance and allowed 
for novel insight on possible etiologic implications of lower-level MGIP in the development of 
MGUS. (PROMISE, NCT03689595).

Introduction
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant clonal 
expansion of plasma cells1,2. It is currently defined as the presence of a serum monoclonal 
protein (M-protein) concentration less than 30 g/L, less than 10% clonal plasma cells in 
the bone marrow, and the absence of myeloma-defining events. MGUS carries a 1% per 
year risk of progression to multiple myeloma (MM) and confers susceptibility to other 
lymphoproliferative disorders, amyloidosis, or light-chain deposition disease1–3.

The first studies evaluating MGUS prevalence originated in Sweden over 50 years ago, 
estimating 3.1% among individuals aged >70 years old4,5. A large prospective screening 
study in Olmsted County, Minnesota subsequently estimated a 3% and 5.3% prevalence 
among individuals aged >50 and >70 years4. These studies, however, were in majority White 
populations and did not consider that MGUS prevalence is two to three times higher in 
Blacks than Whites6–8, with more pronounced differences at younger ages9. MGUS and 
MM appear to be two times more prevalent in individuals who have a first-degree relative 
diagnosed with an MM-related disorder or other lymphoproliferative disease10–13. These 
data suggest that race and family history are important risk factors in MGUS development 
and help identify at-risk individuals.
All MGUS prevalence studies to date have relied on SPEP, a gel-based electrophoretic 
assay, supplemented by immunofixation (IFX) to identify M-proteins. These conventional 
methods, however, have limited sensitivity in detecting lower-level MGs where the M-
protein fades into the polyclonal background. The serum free light chain (sFLC) assay led 
to improvements in the detection of light chain MGUS (LC-MGUS), which has an estimated 
0.8% prevalence in the general population14. Later, mass spectrometry (MS) emerged as a 
more sensitive approach to measure M-proteins, enabling detection of low disease burden, 
including minimal residual disease following therapy15,16. Analyses based on stratified 
quantification of M-proteins for early disease stages of monoclonal gammopathies (MG) 
have not yet been reported.
Our study evaluated the prevalence and association with clinical endpoints of screen-
detected MGs in individuals at higher-than-average risk for MM based on race and family 
history, using a high-throughput quantitative MS approach.
Methods
We performed a cohort study to evaluate the prevalence of screen-detected MGs by MS, in 
a population at high risk for MM and their clinical implications. We screened and analyzed 
serum from participants in two prospectively followed cohorts. Written informed consent 
was obtained from participants in both study cohorts upon recruitment. This study was 
conducted upon approval of protocols 18–370 and 2021P001703 by the institutional review 
boards of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Mass General Brigham, respectively.
Study participants
PROMISE Study—Predicting Progression of Developing Myeloma in a High-Risk 
Screened Population (PROMISE, NCT03689595) was initiated as the first nationwide 
screening study for individuals at high risk for MM, including those who self-identify 
as Black or with a family history of hematological malignancy (HM). Individuals with a 
prior diagnosis of MGUS, Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM), MM, Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia, or other malignancies requiring active therapy were excluded. A total of 
5,037 participants consented to the PROMISE study between February 2019 and November 
2021. Of those, 2,211 provided blood samples during that time. No participants who met the 
study criteria and provided samples were excluded (Appendix P3).

Mass General Brigham Biobank—We identified individuals from the Mass 
General Brigham Biobank (MGBB, https://biobank.massgeneralbrigham.org/) who met the 
PROMISE eligibility criteria and had serum available. We also identified a group of low-risk 
individuals (non-Black, no family history of HM) to serve as negative controls, and a group 
of non-Black, mostly White individuals with unknown family history. Participants from the 
MGBB selected for our study were initially recruited between July 2010 and July 2021 
and their banked serum was screened retrospectively. All participants with a MM diagnosis 
before serum draw date were excluded. Access to participant-level data was conditional 
upon IRB approval (2021P001703). We extracted and identified clinical diagnoses utilizing 
PheCodes and hierarchical groupings of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and 
Tenth Versions (ICD-9/ICD-10) codes. For all screened participants; we extracted vital 
status, recorded as alive or deceased; last date of encounter filed in the EHR; and diagnoses, 
including coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic strokes 
(ISTR), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn’s disease, 
ulcerative colitis (UC), celiac disease, and lymphoid hematologic malignancies (lymphoid 
HM) (Appendix P4).
Mass Spectrometry testing
Serum (500μL) was tested using the EXENT® system and immunoglobulin isotype assay, 
which uses matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS to 
quantify M-proteins (Binding Site Group Ltd.) and Optilite® free light assay to quantify 
IgG, IgA, IgM, and sFLC. EXENT-iQ software was used for quantitative analysis of 
detected M-proteins. The lower limit of accurate M-protein quantification by MALDI-TOF 
MS was 0.015 g/L. More sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was 
performed on a subset of samples to confirm the presence of M-proteins detected at low 
concentration by MALDI-TOF MS. Raw LC-MS data were analyzed using PeakView® 
version 2.2.0.11391 (AB SCIEX). LC-MS results were reviewed and interpreted by 
scientists from the Binding Site Group Ltd., who were blinded to the initial MALDI-TOF 
MS observations, who confirmed the monoclonality of all observations (Appendix P5–8).
Comparing the performance of MALDI-TOF MS to conventional testing methods
Serial dilution sensitivity testing results provided by the manufacturer showed MALDI-TOF 
MS detected all conventional gel-based assays’ positive calls. The lower limit of detection 
for capillary zone electrophoresis, when supplemented with IFX in MS-positive samples, 
was around 0.2 g/L (0.02 g/dL) Further, in a subset of PROMISE study participants 
that had SPEP/IFX results available at the time of analysis, the vast majority (96.3%) of 
isotype-matched M-proteins detected by MALDI-TOF MS and SPEP/IFX had an M-protein 
concentration of >0.2 g/L (>0.02 g/dL) as estimated by MALDI-TOF MS (Appendix P9–
12).
Statistical analyses and missing data
All calculations were done using R (version 4.4.1). Quantitative bio-clinical variables were 
described with median, interquartile range (IQR), and median absolute deviation (MAD), 
or mean and standard deviation. Significance of average difference between groups was

assessed with Kruskal-Wallis method for multiple group testing, and/or Wilcoxon test for 
2 groups. Multiple group testing was followed by Dunn’s post hoc tests when the result 
was significant. Qualitative variables were described using the frequency of their respective 
modalities. The significance of difference between frequencies between groups was assessed 
with Pearson’s test (or Fisher’s exact test if appropriate) and followed by pairwise Fisher’s 
exact test when significant. For survival analysis, time-to-event was calculated from the 
serum draw date to the event date, i.e., death from any cause for overall survival, date 
of initial clinical diagnosis for diseases, or date of the most recent encounter for patients 
reported as alive when extracted from the MGBB. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using 
univariable and multivariable Cox models (with adjusted covariates listed when appropriate). 
HRs were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Survival curves were calculated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method and groups were compared using a Log-rank test. P values 
were corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Adjusted p values 
<0.05 were considered significant (Appendix P13).
One aim of the PROMISE study is to identify clinical and genomic risk factors that 
predispose high-risk individuals to progress from asymptomatic MM precursor stages to 
overt malignancy, for this the PROMISE study plans to recruit up to 30,000 participants for 
screening and prospective follow-up. MS results were available for all participants included 
in our study. When variables with missing data were included in multivariable models, the 
few participants with missing data points for those variables included in the model were 
excluded from the analysis.
Funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. H.E.K., D.J.L., J.B.A., R.R., L.T., C.R.M., and I.M.G. had access to 
the raw data.
Results
We analyzed serum from 7,622 individuals. Of those, 6,305 (2,211 from PROMISE, 4,094 
from MGBB) had high-risk features for MM: 2,439 self-identified as Black (henceforth, 
referred to as Black group) and 3,866 reported a family history of HM or MM precursor (FH 
group). 631 individuals were non-Black with no family history (Control group), and 686 
were non-Black with missing family history (Unknown group) (Figure 1). Median age at 
time of screening was 56 years (IQR: 45.8–64.1, range, 18 to 95). 5,013/7,622 (66%) were 
female. Demographic data, including race, gender, and date of birth, was self-reported by 
participants. Table 1 and Appendix P14–15 show demographic distributions by study cohort 
and risk group.
We identified the lower limit of detection for conventional gel-based methods (SPEP/IFX) 
by serial dilution sensitivity testing as 0.2g/L, below which MALDI-TOF MS still detected 
and quantified the M-proteins (Methods and Appendix P9–12). Accordingly, M-proteins 
quantified by MS at ≥0.2 g/L are hereafter referred to as MGUS detected by mass 
spectrometry (MS-MGUS). In contrast, we refer to M-proteins detected by MS at <0.2 
g/L as monoclonal gammopathy of indeterminate potential (MGIP) to better preserve the 
clinical associations with MGUS previously described by Kyle et al.3. Hereon, MGIP cases

include participants with an MG detected and quantified <0.2g/L and ≥0.015g/L (lowest 
limit of quantification), while MS-MGUS cases include participants with a MG detected 
and quantified ≥0.2 g/L. MS negative cases include participants with no MG detected above 
0.015g/L. 75 samples from participants with MGIP were tested by LC-MS. M-protein 
detection and monoclonality were confirmed in 75/75 (100%) (Appendix P6–8).
MG was detected in 36% (2,740/7,622) of our total screened cohort, MS-MGUS was 
detected in 10% (755/7,622), and MGIP in 26% (1,952/7,622). The most common 
immunoglobulin isotype detected in MS-MGUS was IgG (62%, 469/755), followed by IgA 
(13%, 97/755), IgM (13%, 98/755), and biclonal gammopathy (12%, 91/755). The most 
common isotype in MGIP was IgM (60%, 1,172/1,952), followed by IgA (10%, 190/1,952) 
and IgG (6%, 117/1,952). The remaining 24% (473/1,952) of MGIP cases had multiple M-
protein peaks (median 2, IQR 2 to 3, range, 2 to 6) (Appendix P16–19). The isotype-specific 
prevalence of MS-MGUS and MGIP is described by age groups, gender, and risk groups in 
Appendix P20.
The MS-MGUS and MGIP prevalence increased with age in the entire cohort (P<0.0001) 
(Figures 2A,B). For age groups ≤50, ≥50, and ≥70 years, MS-MGUS prevalence was 5% 
(127/2,564), 13% (678/5,058), and 18% (173/946), respectively, and MGIP prevalence was 
19% (488/2,564), 29% (1,464/5,058), and 37% (347/946), respectively. MS-MGUS was 
more common in males (P<0.00018), while MGIP did not differ significantly by gender 
(Appendix P21).
MG was detected in 36% (2,269/6,305) of high-risk individuals. The prevalence was 
43% (1,788/4,207) in high-risk participants age ≥50. In this age group, the prevalence of 
MS-MGUS was higher in Black (17%, 224/1,356) and FH (13%, 368/2,851), compared 
to Control (10%, 38/384), following the expected relative trends although not reaching 
statistical significance for the latter. (P=0.0012 and P=0.1008, respectively). MGIP 
prevalence in each high-risk group was not significantly different from that in Control, 
for participants aged≥50 and all ages (Appendix P21). There were no significant differences 
in MS-MGUS and MGIP prevalence between the MGBB and PROMISE study cohorts 
(Appendix P22).
2,192 high-risk PROMISE participants were screened by SPEP/IFX and MS. The MGUS 
prevalence by SPEP/IFX was 5% (112/2,192) (95% CI, 4.3 to 6.2) and 11% (242/2,192) by 
MS (95% CI, 9.5 to 12). Among PROMISE participants aged ≥50 years, MGUS prevalence 
was 6% (101/1,714) (95% CI, 4.7 to 7.0) by SPEP/IFX and 13% (217/1,714) (95% CI, 10.9 
to 14.0), which are both higher than the 3% prevalence reported for the general population 
age ≥50 in the Olmsted County study4 (Appendix P23).
A summary of prevalence rates in our study is presented in Appendix P23–24.
Multivariable logistic regression models evaluated the associations of age, gender, and risk 
groups with screening positive for MGs. Screening positive for any MG was associated with 
age (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.43 to 1.55) and Black (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.18 to 
1.75). MS-MGUS was associated with age (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.62 to 1.85) and Black (OR, 
1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.52). There was a moderate association between MS-MGUS and

male gender (OR, 1.16; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.36), which did not reach statistical significance. 
Age, male gender, Black group, and FH were all significantly associated with MS-MGUS on 
univariable analysis. MGIP was associated with age (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.47) and 
Black group (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06 to 163) (Appendix P25).
Longitudinal clinical data were available for MGBB participants. The median follow-up 
from serum sample screening was 4.5 years (IQR, 2.4 to 6.7 years; range, 0 to 11 years). 
In a multivariable Cox proportiona-lhazards model adjusting for age, gender, risk group, and 
Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI), having any MG detected by MS at any concentration 
was associated with increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.55; 95% CI, 1.16 to 
2.08, Figure 3A). When restricted to participants aged≥50, the HR for all-cause mortality 
for MG detected by MS was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.22 to 2.31) (Figure 3B). After stratifying 
MGs by concentration, MS-MGUS was significantly associated with increased all-cause 
mortality (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.51 to 3.13), compared to having no MG. In participants 
aged ≥50, the HR of MS-MGUS for all-cause mortality was 2.34 (95% CI, 1.59 to 3.47). 
We next examined whether high-concentration MGIP mimicked the behavior of MGUS 
in this cohort. Using median concentration of all MGIPs (0.04g/L), we divided MGIP 
into MGIP-Low (L) <0.04g/L and MGIP-High (H) ≥0.04 g/L. MGIP-H was significantly 
associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.43) compared 
to having no MG, while MGIP-L was not significantly associated with increased all-cause 
mortality. In participants aged>50, HR for MGIP-H for all-cause mortality was 1.80 (95% 
CI, 1.20 to 2.71) (Appendix P26–28).
For the MGBB cohort, age-adjusted logistic regression models evaluated the associations of 
MG with various comorbidities diagnosed at any point in the participants’ lifetimes (Figure 
4). MS-MGUS was associated with MI, SLE, UC, and lymphoid HMs, including chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, all lymphoid leukemias, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma. MGIP-H was associated with CAD, MI, RA, UC, and Hodgkin lymphoma. 
Clinical comorbidities associated with MGs did not differ significantly when comparing our 
high-risk group to controls in the MGBB cohort (Appendix P29).
In age-adjusted logistic regression models, having any MG was associated with being 
diagnosed with lymphoid HM ≥6 months after the screening date (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.95 to 
4.79). MS-MGUS had nearly 8 times greater odds of being diagnosed with a lymphoid HM 
≥6 months after screening (OR, 8.31; 95% CI, 5.10 to 13.66), compared to no MG. MGIP 
was not associated with such outcomes (Appendix P30–31). When evaluating the incidence 
of clinical comorbidities diagnosed ≥6 months after the screening date, MS-MGUS was 
associated with MI (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.88) and systemic lupus erythematosus (OR, 
4.14; 95% CI, 1.12 to 13.54) (Appendix P32).
Serial samples were available for 58 participants who screened positive for MG. The median 
time from baseline screening to the latest sample available was 300 days for MGIP cases 
(IQR, 130 to 573, range, 86 to 864 days) and 235 days for MS-MGUS cases (IQR, 130 to 
573, range, 36 to 905 days). Despite a limited number of events, higher concentration of 
the MG detected at baseline screening was associated with the persistence of the MG over 
time (P<0.0001). Among the 26 baseline MGIP cases, 13 (50%) screened positive upon any

serial sampling, and 10 (38%) were positive on the latest sample available, with a maximum 
follow-up time of 2.5 years. One baseline MGIP case screened negative on days +589 and 
+689 and subsequently screened positive at +864. Two MGIP cases exhibited an increase 
in M-protein concentration that reached 0.2 g/L (i.e., to MS-MGUS). Among 32 baseline 
MS-MGUS cases, 30 (94%) screened positive upon any serial sampling. Most baseline 
MS-MGUS cases (23, 72%) exhibited a consistent increase in M-protein concentration, 
including one that progressed to SMM, defined as >30 g/L (Appendix P33).
Discussion
Prior estimates of MGUS prevalence are based on SPEP/IFX and predominantly White 
study populations. We present the largest screening study for serum monoclonal proteins 
across concentrations in high-risk individuals examined to date. Our study identifies a very 
high prevalence of all MGs, >40%, in high-risk individuals aged ≥50. Compared to the 
prevalence of 3% detected by SPEP/IFX in the general population aged ≥50 years, we 
found that high-risk individuals in our cohort from the same age group had an MS-MGUS 
prevalence over four times higher (13%). Prior studies showed that MS detects higher rates 
of monoclonal proteins for the diagnosis of MGUS; however, they were limited to a few 
hundred participants from the Olmsted County study and measured an MGUS prevalence 
of around 5% only, using a non-quantitative MS approach. Here, the same relative increase 
in MS-MGUS prevalence is maintained for at-risk individuals compared to controls, with 
MS detecting more cases than before in non-high-risk controls. Such rates of MS-MGUS 
may have been detected in our study due to the nature of the cohorts, however, we have 
shown that there was no difference in the prevalence of MGs across study cohorts and 
that the recorded comorbidities did not significantly differ across risk groups, hence not 
acting as a driver for the difference in prevalence rates. In our study, MG quantification 
allowed for stratification of outcomes, risk estimates, and clinical associations based on 
concentration cut points and accurate comparison to the currently widely available methods. 
MS-MGUS patients identified by our targeted screening approach had significantly worse 
survival compared to individuals with no MGs, after accounting for age, gender, risk group, 
and CCI. This finding builds on prior studies of more racially homogeneous populations in 
Sweden and southeastern Minnesota. These results, therefore, continue to motivate efforts 
to prospectively follow and screen a high-risk population to explore the clinical benefit of 
active, targeted screening strategies.
MS allowed for MG quantification at lower concentrations than was previously possible by 
SPEP/IFX, providing a new opportunity to explore their significance to the malignant and 
non-malignant clonal expansion of plasma cells. Unlike in MS-MGUS, where the prevalence 
was expectedly greater in high-risk groups, the prevalence of these low-level MGs, which 
we have termed MGIP, did not differ significantly across the defined race and family history 
risk groups, suggesting that these host factors may be permissive of further clonal expansion 
from MGIP to MGUS. The association of MGIP with increasing age may be analogous to 
age-associated clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and somatic clonal 
expansion in other normal tissues and may motivate future sequencing of plasma cells of 
study participants17–20. Indeed, we hypothesize that in a subset of individuals MGIP may 
have etiologic implications for MGUS development in combination with certain host and

environmental factors, such as race, inflammation, and genetic predisposition. However, we 
do not believe that all MGIP cases are premalignant as transient M-proteins have been 
described in the setting of immune-related disorders, infections, allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplant, and solid organ transplant21–26. Also, the oligoclonality of some MGIP 
cases may support future studies to test the hypothesis that an oligoclonal to monoclonal 
transition occurs during the development of some plasma cell disorders. Further, similar to 
MS-MGUS, MGIP-H was associated with worse OS, highlighting the biological continuum 
of MGs, with the MGs at the upper limit of MGIP (MGIP-H) potentially sharing biologic 
similarities with MS-MGUS. It remains unknown whether MGIP is an earlier precursor 
state along the MGUS-to-MM continuum. We acknowledge that by excluding patients with 
a diagnosis of MM prior to screening date, and the short follow-up time available for 
participants in the MGBB cohort, the association of MGIP with plasma cell dyscrasias could 
not be assessed in this study. Longer follow-up time is required to test the hypothesis that 
some lower-level MGIP cases carry an increased risk of developing plasma cell disorders, 
specifically.
Our results, from a study cohort enriched for participants of Black ancestry, necessitated an 
adjusted reference range for sFLC ratio for the diagnosis of LC-MGUS. After adjusting for 
kidney function, our analysis provides a proof-of-concept for defining population-specific 
reference ranges when evaluating sFLC. Further studies are needed to define appropriate 
reference ranges for specific patient populations, especially when using sFLC ratio for 
diagnosis or prognostication of patients with more advanced disease27,28 (Appendix P35–
37).
The assay used in our study is not yet available commercially or clinically across healthcare 
centers. However, we show data that helps establish the clinical utility and interpretation 
of results for clinical use of quantitative MALDI-TOF MS to screen populations at risk for 
myeloma. We present the first results of quantitative MS using artificial-intelligence-based 
software, which standardizes clinical interpretation and allow for accurate longitudinal 
follow-up per patient.
Our data begin to highlight the need for myeloma screening in high-risk populations using 
high-sensitivity methods. In summary, we found a high >40% MG prevalence using MS to 
screen a predominantly high-risk population, defined by self-reported Black race and family 
history of HM. Our study demonstrates that MGs are significantly associated with worse 
OS and the development of HMs. We define a new clinical entity of low-concentration MG 
(i.e., MGIP) that had a high prevalence of approximately 25%, a notably different risk factor 
profile than MGUS, and associations with age and MI. This study highlights the clinical 
significance of MGs, which we now have an expanded opportunity to explore with MS 
and may ultimately be translated to beneficial clinical and public health strategies. Future 
directions will include screening participants serially to determine long-term MG outcomes 
and next-generation sequencing to explore the molecular drivers of clonal expansion.
Limitations of our study include the lack of precise associations of MGIP detected by 
mass spectrometry with plasma cell disorders due to the prospective nature of the study 
and the immaturity of the data at this time. In our study, females exhibited a higher

propensity to participate in the PROMISE screening program and the MGBB than males. 
We did not conduct analyses for races or ethnicities, such as Asian and Hispanic, and 
relied on self-reported race rather than genetic ancestry. Also, the MGBB subgroup is 
not a population-based cohort and the associations drawn with overall survival and other 
clinical phenotypes remain to be investigated in larger studies. The prevalences described 
in our study were not impacted by the nature of the cohort, but remain to be generalized 
cautiously. Finally, the clinical implications of MGIP should be investigated in larger and 
more homogeneous cohorts.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Databases searched by the authors for prior evidence of the subject studied included 
Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar. The search terms used included Monoclonal 
gammopathies, MGUS, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, 
prevalence, predisposition, risk factors, comorbidities, multiple myeloma, and cancer 
screening. Prior evidence of the prevalence of monoclonal gammopathies mainly relied 
on the use of conventional gel-based methods (SPEP and IFX). The prevalence of 
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was shown to be around 
3–5% in the general population above the age of 50, in individuals of mostly White 
ancestry. MGUS was shown to be more prevalent in those who identified as being Black 
or had a family history of a plasma cell malignancy. There was no prior evidence of 
a quantitative high-sensitivity mass spectrometry assay to evaluate the prevalence of 
monoclonal gammopathies in general in a prospectively followed high-risk cohort.
Added value of this study
Our findings address the gap in the literature relating to the benefits of screening and 
early detection of monoclonal gammopathies using a novel high sensitivity quantitative 
mass spectrometry approach and evaluate for the first time the clinical implications of 
lower-level monoclonal gammopathies detected and quantified by screening.
Implications of all the available evidence
Together with future work, this will allow improved delineation of the benefits 
of screening, the use of a high sensitivity assay for the detection of monoclonal 
gammopathies and further investigate the clinical implications proposed for lower-
level monoclonal gammopathies detected by this assay. In future work, we plan to 
further investigate the etiology of MGIP, its relation to plasma cell disorders, other 
comorbidities, and overall survival. We also plan to leverage germline genomic and 
health record data from participants in our study to further investigate factors that may 
predispose high-risk individuals to develop a monoclonal gammopathy.
Individual participant data, including data dictionaries, are not available for sharing, in 
accordance with the PROMISE study protocol (PROMISE, NCT03689595).
