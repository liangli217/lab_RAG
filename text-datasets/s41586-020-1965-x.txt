The discovery of drivers of cancer has traditionally focused on protein-coding 
genes1–4. Here we present analyses of driver point mutations and structural variants in 
non-coding regions across 2,658 genomes from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole 
Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium5 of the International Cancer Genome Consortium 
(ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For point mutations, we developed a 
statistically rigorous strategy for combining significance levels from multiple 
methods of driver discovery that overcomes the limitations of individual methods. 
For structural variants, we present two methods of driver discovery, and identify 
regions that are significantly affected by recurrent breakpoints and recurrent somatic 
juxtapositions. Our analyses confirm previously reported drivers6,7, raise doubts 
about others and identify novel candidates, including point mutations in the 5′ region 
of TP53, in the 3′ untranslated regions of NFKBIZ and TOB1, focal deletions in BRD4 and 
rearrangements in the loci of AKR1C genes. We show that although point mutations 
and structural variants that drive cancer are less frequent in non-coding genes and 
regulatory sequences than in protein-coding genes, additional examples of these 
drivers will be found as more cancer genomes become available.
Previous large-scale sequencing projects have identified many putative 
cancer genes, but most efforts have concentrated on mutations and 
copy-number alterations in protein-coding genes, mainly using whole-
exome sequencing and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays1–4. 
Whole-genome sequencing has made it possible to systematically 
survey non-coding regions for potential driver events, including 
single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and deletions 
(indels) and larger structural variants. Whole-genome sequencing 
enables the precise localization of structural variant breakpoints and 
connections between distinct genomic loci (juxtapositions). Although 
previous whole-genome sequencing analyses of modestly sized cohorts 
have revealed candidate non-coding regulatory driver events8–15,

the frequency and functional implications of these events remain 
understudied6,7,13,16,17.
Driver identification remains a far greater challenge in non-coding 
regions than in coding genes, owing to sequencing and mapping arte-
facts, poorly understood localized hypermutation processes14,18,19, 
incomplete annotation of regulatory regions, inaccurate estimation 
of the background mutation rate and the unknown functional effect 
of non-coding mutations. The discovery of drivers from structural 
variants is further complicated by their sparsity, the lack of obvious 
neutral events to build background models and their complex func-
tional effects. Adequate statistical methods that address these issues 
are needed to reliably identify non-coding drivers.
The ICGC and TCGA PCAWG effort, which has collected and system-
atically analysed cancer genome sequences from 2,658 patients across 
38 types of cancer5, offers an opportunity to characterize putative 
non-coding driver events that cannot be found using data from whole-
exome sequencing or single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Here we 
describe a comprehensive search for non-coding somatic drivers. For 
point mutations (SNVs and indels), we combine results from multiple 
driver-discovery algorithms and, by carefully evaluating the signifi-
cant hits, reveal that recurrent artefacts and poorly understood muta-
tional processes have led to common false positives among previously 
reported non-coding drivers. For structural variants, we introduce two 
new methods for identifying both regions with significantly recurrent 
breakpoints (SRBs) and with significantly recurrent juxtapositions 
(SRJs), accounting for genomic heterogeneity in the rates of DNA break 
and repair and the three-dimensional architecture of the genome. 
Finally, to assess the potential for future non-coding driver discoveries, 
we quantify our statistical power in the PCAWG dataset and estimate 
the overall excess of point mutations in non-coding regulatory regions 
around known cancer genes.
Hotspot mutations across cancer types
Many protein-coding driver mutations occur in single-site ‘hotspots’. In 
the PCAWG dataset, only 12 single-nucleotide positions were mutated 
in >1%, and 106 in >0.5%, of patients (Extended Data Fig. 1a, Methods). 
Although protein-coding regions span only about 1% of the genome, 15 
out of 50 (30%) of the most frequently mutated sites were well-studied 
hotspots in cancer genes (KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, TP53 and IDH1) (Fig. 1a, 
Extended Data Fig. 1b), along with the two canonical TERT promoter 
hotspots6,7.
The remaining non-coding hotspots could be attributed to the 
following localized mutational processes associated with passenger 
events: (i) damage from ultraviolet (UV) light and impaired nucleotide 
excision repair in melanoma at sites occupied by transcription fac-
tors5,18–20; (ii) somatic hypermutation by activation-induced cytosine 
deaminase (AID) in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Lymph–BNHL) 
and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (Lymph–CLL); (iii) palindromic 
sequence contexts believed to form hairpin DNA structures targeted 
by APOBEC enzymes (in an intron of GPR126 (also known as ADGRG6) 
and the PLEKHS1 promoter)10; and (iv) presumed technical artefacts 
(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Note 1). These findings suggest that—besides 
TERT promoter events—non-coding single-site hotspot drivers are 
infrequent or fall in regions with low sensitivity to detect mutations.
Discovery of point-mutation drivers
To identify recurrently mutated genomic elements, we first analysed 
somatic SNVs and indels in protein-coding regions, RNA genes (long 
and short non-coding RNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs)), and regula-
tory regions (promoters, 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs), 3′ UTRs and 
enhancers), totalling about 4% of the genome (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c, 
Methods, Supplementary Table 1). We analysed 2,583 tumours from 
27 individual tumour types, and 15 meta-cohorts that grouped cancers 
by tissue of origin or organ system (Extended Data Fig. 2d, Methods). 
We identified candidate drivers—that is, cohort–element combinations 
with Q < 0.1 (10% false discovery rate (FDR))—by integrating 13 discov-
ery algorithms, circumventing biases introduced by any one method 
(Extended Data Figs. 2e, 11, Supplementary Tables 2, 3, Supplementary 
Note 2). We benchmarked this approach by evaluating its ability to 
detect 603 known cancer genes (from the Cancer Gene Census (CGC)21, 
v.80), and found that combining methods improved performance 
compared to single algorithms (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b, Methods). 
Overall, we identified 1,294 significant hits that involved 520 unique 
candidates (Supplementary Tables 4, 5).
Filtering the significant hits
Even after conservative FDR control, false-positive ‘driver’ loci can 
remain, owing to inaccurate background models, sequencing and map-
ping artefacts, or local increases in mutations due to unaccounted-for 
mutational processes. We therefore systematically filtered the candi-
date driver elements on the basis of technical and biological criteria, 
followed by careful review (Extended Data Fig. 3c, Methods, Supple-
mentary Note 3). Examples of filtered elements include the promot-
ers of PIM1 (lymphoid tumours) and RPL13A (melanoma) because of 
associations with localized AID and UV-light mutational processes, 
respectively; PLEKHS1, GPR126, TBC1D12 and LEPROTL1 because of 
palindromic APOBEC target sequences9,10; and the WDR74 5′ UTR and 
promoter8,10,14, owing to mapping problems detected in downstream 
manual review (Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Note 4). In 
combination, filtering and reapplying FDR control discarded 589 out of 
1,294 (46%) of the original cohort–element hits and 341 out of 520 (66%) 
unique elements (Extended Data Fig. 3c, Supplementary Tables 4, 5).
Candidate coding and non-coding drivers
Our stringent combination and filtering strategy yielded 705 hits 
in 179 genomic elements: 602 hits in 143 protein-coding genes and 
103 hits in non-coding elements. We observed wide variability across 
different types of cancer, from one hit in clear-cell renal cancer to 
80 in the pan-cancer meta-cohort (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Tables 4,5). 
Although most candidate drivers gained significance in larger meta-
cohorts, some genes—such as DAXX (pancreatic endocrine tumour), 
NRAS (melanoma), SPOP (prostate adenocarcinoma), FGFR1 (pilocytic 
astrocytoma) and MIR142 (Lymph–BNHL)—scored higher in individual 
tumour types (Extended Data Fig. 3d). These results emphasize the 
trade-off between limiting driver discovery analyses to particular types 
of tumour and maximizing cohort size.
The candidate coding drivers we identified agreed with previous 
results: of the 143 genes that were significant in at least 1 cohort, 69% 
are in the CGC and nearly all have previously been implicated in can-
cer. In contrast to large whole-exome sequencing datasets, the fewer 
patients per cancer type in this dataset provided power sufficient only 
to detect genes with the strongest signal. We found 116 additional hits 
in 84 unique elements that were ‘near significance’ (0.1 < Q < 0.25). 
Fifty-one per cent of the 63 unique protein-coding genes in this set 
are in the CGC, which suggests that they would have been discovered 
in larger cohorts (Supplementary Table 4).
To nominate a significant non-coding element as a candidate driver, 
we reviewed the supporting evidence from the mutation calls, addi-
tional genomic data (chromosomal breakpoints, copy number, loss-
of-heterozygosity and expression data), cancer gene databases and the 
literature (Methods, Supplementary Tables 6, 10). We describe the key 
candidates below, and in Supplementary Note 4.
The TERT promoter was the most frequently mutated non-coding 
driver in this dataset (14 cohorts) (Fig. 1b), and these mutations were 
strongly associated with higher TERT expression, as has previously 
been reported9 (Extended Data Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 10).

Mutations in the promoter and/or 5′ UTR of MTG2 (which encodes 
a GTPase involved in the mitochondrial ribosome) were associated 
with an expression of MTG2 that was marginally significantly lower, in 
both the pan-cancer (P = 0.036, fold difference = 0.8) and carcinoma 
(P = 0.029, fold difference = 0.8) meta-cohorts (Extended Data Figs. 4a, 
5a). Mutations in the 5′ UTR have previously been shown to decrease 
MTG2 expression in vitro22.
Recurrent somatic events were identified in the 3′ UTRs of TOB1 
(carcinoma and pan-cancer meta-cohorts), NFKBIZ (lymphomas) and 
ALB (liver cancer) (Fig. 1b). TOB1 encodes an anti-proliferation regulator

that associates with ERBB2, and also affects migration and invasion in 
gastric cancer23. TOB1 regulates other mRNAs through binding to their 
3′ UTR and promoting deadenylation24. Tumours with 3′ UTR mutations 
in TOB1 showed a trend towards decreased expression (P = 0.053, fold 
difference = 0.7). The mutations did not concentrate in known miRNA-
binding sites; however, the region is extremely conserved and thus 
probably functional (Fig. 2a). TOB1 and its neighbouring gene WFIKKN2 
are focally amplified in breast cancer and pan-cancer, suggesting a 
complex role in cancer (Extended Data Fig. 4b). NFKBIZ is a transcrip-
tion factor that is mutated in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and ampli-
fied in primary lymphomas25. Mutations in the 3′ UTR accumulated 
in a hotspot proximal to the stop codon and upstream of conserved 
miRNA-binding sites (Extended Data Fig. 5b). The enrichment of indels 
next to the stop codon suggests that this hotspot is not due to AID off-
target activity. Previous functional experiments have associated these 
mutations with increased NFKBIZ expression25, which we observed in 
our lymphoma cohort (P = 0.035, fold difference = 3.2; after correction 
for copy number, P = 0.03) (Extended Data Fig. 5b).
Both the exon and promoter of the non-coding RNA RMRP were sig-
nificantly mutated in multiple types of cancer (Fig. 1b, Extended Data 
Fig. 5c). Germline RMRP mutations cause cartilage–hair hypoplasia, 
and previous in vitro studies have shown that some somatic promoter 
mutations are functional16. The RMRP locus is also focally amplified in 
several types of tumour (Extended Data Fig. 4b). The enrichment of 
mutations in sites that can affect secondary structure suggests that 
these mutations are functional (P = 0.011, permutation test) (Extended 
Data Fig. 5c), although caution is required because this locus also 
appears to be affected by mapping artefacts or increased mutation 
rates (Supplementary Note 4).
The miR-142 precursor miRNA was significant in Lymph–BNHL and 
the lymphatic and haematopoietic cohorts (Fig. 1b; Extended Data 
Fig. 5d). The locus is a known AID off-target region in lymphoma12,26, 
but 7 out of 8  mutations in the mature miRNA mir-142-p3––for which 
the largest functional effect is expected––were not assigned to AID, 
which suggests that these mutations are under selection12.
Unbiased genome-wide driver screen
To test whether we missed drivers by focusing on functionally anno-
tated regions, we applied an unbiased genome-wide survey to all non-
overlapping 2-kb windows for excess point mutations. Twenty-two of 
the resulting 67 significant windows overlap with known protein-coding 
drivers, and 28 overlap highly transcribed regions with an excess of 
2–5-bp indels (described in the ‘Transcription-associated indel signa-
ture’ section below) (Extended Data Fig. 5e, Supplementary Table 9, 
Supplementary Note 5). The remaining 17 windows have no obvious 
link to cancer, and several appear to be affected by mapping artefacts. 
A separate analysis of 4,351 ultra-conserved non-coding regions did not 
yield new candidate drivers (Extended Data Fig. 5e, Supplementary 
Note 5). Both screens suggest that the paucity of non-coding point-
mutation drivers found in this study is not due to the annotation of 
functional elements.

Increasing power for known cancer genes
Finally, we performed restricted hypothesis testing to boost the sta-
tistical power to detect cis-regulatory driver mutations near cancer 
genes from the CGC21 (Supplementary Table 7). Restricted hypothesis 
testing of cancer gene promoters revealed a significant recurrence of 
TP53 promoter mutations (11 patients in pan-cancer, Q = 0.044), mostly 
comprising SNVs and deletions that affect the transcription start site 
or donor splice site of the first non-coding exon. In 10 out of 11 cases, 
the mutation occurred in combination with loss-of-heterozygosity, 
and all samples with expression data showed decreased mRNA levels 
(Fig. 2b). None of these patients contained additional coding mutations 
that could instead be responsible for the downregulation of TP53. To 
our knowledge, this is the first report of a relatively infrequent—but 
impactful—form of TP53 inactivation by non-coding mutations.
Focal gains or losses in cancer are selected for modulating expres-
sion levels of their target genes. Restricting the hypothesis testing to 
the non-coding elements of such genes (n = 216,986 cohort–element 
combinations, representing 5,201 unique elements) (Methods) yielded 
only one new hit, the 3′ UTR of the oncogene FOXA1 in prostate can-
cer (Supplementary Table 11).
Transcription-associated indel signature
Several significant non-coding elements (the ALB 3′ UTR, NEAT1, 
MALAT1 and MIR122) were hit by many indels; all have previously 
been reported to be mutated in cancer10,15,27 (Figs. 1b, 2c). To explore 
whether ALB 3′ UTR events are under selection, we calculated indel rates 
across the functional regions of this gene. The indel rate is notably high 
throughout the UTRs, introns and exons, and even downstream of the 
polyadenylation site—a pattern inconsistent with selection (Fig. 2c, d). 
Similarly, FOXA1 has high indel rates throughout its locus, whereas the 
indels in NFKBIZ and TOB1 are in their 3′ UTRs, suggesting that these 
are driver events (Fig. 2d). ALB, NEAT1 and MALAT1 mutations were not 
associated with changes in gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 4a) 
and were not associated with high cancer cell fractions or biallelic loss 
(Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). Likewise, indels in MIR122 were downstream 
of the mature miRNA, and were not associated with altered expression 
of the targets of this miRNA (Supplementary Note 5).
If the indels in these genes were due to a mutational process rather 
than selection, they might exhibit distinct features. Indeed, indels in 
NEAT1, MALAT1, MIR122 and ALB were strongly enriched in 2–5-bp-long 
events (Fisher’s P < 6.8 × 10−5, for all) (Fig. 2e). A systematic search of 
coding and non-coding genes with significantly (Q < 0.1) increased 
rates of 2–5-bp indels revealed that this mutational process affects at 
least 18 additional genes in different types of tumour, most of which are 
highly expressed and tissue-specific (as has previously been reported 
for some of these genes15) (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f). Although less 
enriched, SNVs also occur at high frequencies in these regions (Fig. 2f). 
Overall, our findings suggest that the indels in MALAT1, NEAT1, ALB and 
MIR122 are not driver events and are the result of a transcription-asso-
ciated mutational process. The previously reported oncogenic effect 
of altered MALAT1 and NEAT1 expression27–29 may thus be unrelated 
to these mutations. Our findings also suggest that although FOXA1 
protein-coding indels are drivers, 3′ UTR indels might be passengers30.
Breakpoints at driver and fragile sites
Driver structural variants may act by disrupting one or both of their 
breakpoint loci (for example, deactivating a tumour suppressor), or 
by generating a novel juxtaposition between loci. We thus searched 
both for genomic regions with SRBs and for pairs of regions with SRJs 
(Extended Data Fig. 7).
For SRBs, we first defined a background model to predict breakpoint 
density, using eight explanatory variables (Methods, Supplementary 
Table 13) and accounting for unexplained sources of variation31 (Sup-
plementary Note 6). We identified 53 disjoint regions with SRBs (Q < 0.1) 
(Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 14), which cleanly divided into two groups 
on the basis of the variability of the breakpoints at the other side of the 
rearrangements. Eight SRBs had partner breakpoints that were tightly 
clustered (had low rearrangement dispersion scores; Methods) and 
represented known oncogenic fusions. The remaining 45 SRBs had 
dispersed partner breakpoints (had high rearrangement dispersion 
scores), and were largely associated with previously identified somatic 
copy-number alterations (SCNAs) (Fig. 3b).
It has been difficult to distinguish recurrent driver SCNAs from 
passenger events at fragile sites32. At the resolution afforded by 
whole-genome sequencing, late replication timing predicted fra-
gility-associated SRBs better than existing fragile site annotations 
(Supplementary Note 7), identifying 12 fragile-like SRBs (Fig. 3b). The 
remaining 33 SCNA-like SRBs comprised 14 amplifications, 8 deletions 
and 11 copy-neutral events (Supplementary Table 14).
The different classes of SRB were associated with different effects 
on neighbouring genes. Five of the eight deletion-associated SRBs 
were associated with biallelic inactivation of nearby known tumour 
suppressors, compared to none of the 12 fragile-like SRBs (P = 0.039) 
(Extended Data Fig. 8a). The fragile-like SRBs were furthest from tissue-
matched enhancers and caused the weakest expression changes, con-
sistent with them being passenger events32. By contrast, fusion-like SRBs 
were closer to tissue-matched enhancers than the other SRBs (P < 0.01) 
(Extended Data Fig. 8b) and were associated with greater changes in 
expression than all other SRBs except amplifications (P < 0.05 for all 
types) (Extended Data Fig. 8c, Methods). Our analyses indicate that 
SRB driver events can be classified using rearrangement dispersion 
scores, replication timing and gene expression. Notably, neither rear-
rangement dispersion scores nor association with replication time can 
be accurately determined from microarrays or whole-exome sequenc-
ing, which highlights the importance of whole-genome sequencing. 
Altogether, we identified SRBs at 34 sites of known oncogenic fusions 
and recurrent SCNAs, 5 additional sites that are probably due to DNA 
fragility and 14 novel driver candidates (Supplementary Note 8).
Novel structural-variant driver candidates
Although most SCNA-like SRBs act by altering gene copy numbers, 
several appeared to target regulatory elements. We identified three 
that were significantly (Q < 0.05) associated with expression changes 
of nearby genes after controlling for copy number (Methods), two of 
which we discuss here. The first comprised structural variants at 10p15, 
which were associated with a greater than twofold upregulation of 
AKR1C1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 in seven cases of lung squamous cell car-
cinoma and two cases of liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Extended Data 
Fig. 8d). AKR1C proteins are aldo-keto reductases involved in steroid 
homeostasis. Ectopic expression transforms cell lines, and germline 
mutations have previously been linked to an increased risk of develop-
ing lung cancer33,34. Three-quarters of the breakpoints are near (<10 kb) 
lineage-specific enhancers, potentially altering promoter–enhancer 
interactions (and hence gene expression). However, because the high-
est density of breakpoints lies between two long inverted repeats, the 
structural variants may have been induced by DNA secondary structure.
The second SRB contains recurrent microdeletions (<50 kb) involving 
the 5′ end of BRD4 in ovarian (eight cases, P < 10−7) and breast tumours 
(six cases, P < 0.04) (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 8e). These deletions 
were highly enriched in cancers that amplified a segment that includes 
BRD4 and NOTCH3 (P < 0.004) (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 8f) but were 
not a direct consequence of these amplifications (Supplementary 
Note 9). BRD4 is a chromatin regulator and a therapeutic target in sev-
eral types of cancer35,36, including ovarian and triple-negative breast 
cancer37,38. Given the increased copy number of the full BRD4 gene, we 
would expect increased gene expression. However, the microdeletions 

Nature  |  Vol 578  |  6 February 2020  |  107
are associated with a lower expression of BRD4 in breast (P = 0.001) 
and ovarian tumours (P = 0.04), but not of the neighbouring gene 
NOTCH3 (Fig. 3e). The focal deletions in BRD4 overlap a prominent 
exon-1 H3K4me3 peak and intron-1 enhancer elements in HMEC (nor-
mal breast) and MCF-7 (breast tumour) cells (Extended Data Fig. 8e), 
which suggests that these deletions disrupt regulatory elements.

To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a recurrent microdeletion 
limiting expression of an amplified gene.
Recurrent fusions target gene regulation
Motivated by the detection of fusion-like SRBs, we specifically looked 
for genomic loci that were juxtaposed more often than expected by 
chance, after controlling for both the rate of breakpoints at each locus 
and the distance between them (Methods). We identified 90 such SRJs 
(Fig. 3f, Supplementary Table 15), including 13 known oncogenic fusions 
(including all 8 fusion-like SRBs) and 77 novel hits—18 of which linked 
to at least one known cancer gene (Supplementary Note 8). Previously 
reported oncogenic SRJs were observed more frequently (average 
24 patients per fusion, range 2–98) than novel ones (most often 2 
patients per fusion, range 2–4). As juxtapositions are unlikely to occur 
by chance, observing even two becomes highly significant. However, it 
is possible that some SRJs reflect inaccuracies in our background model 
rather than true drivers. We therefore further evaluated the SRJs on the 
basis of (i) a ‘robustness factor’ that indicates how much the background 
rate could increase before the SRJ would become insignificant, and (ii) 
the ratio between the observed and expected numbers of events under 
the current background model (‘effect size’) (Extended Data Fig. 9a). 
Twenty-six SRJs, including 11 of the 13 known drivers and 15 newly iden-
tified SRJs, are robust to tripling the expected background rate, and 
22 others would remain significant with a doubled rate.
Most canonical driver rearrangements have previously been found 
in single tumour types, often associated with tissue-specific expres-
sion39,40. We found that 9 of our top 10 SRJs are tissue-specific, despite 
searching across 30 different types of tumour. Such tissue specificity 
is not observed for cancer genes affected by SCNAs, for which the top 
10 are altered in 11.9 cancer types (on average), or by point mutations 
(for which the top 10 are altered in 6.7 cancer types, on average) (Sup-
plementary Table 16).
The tissue specificity of SRJs suggests that they are strongly shaped 
by epigenetic state, either owing to mechanistic reasons (for example, 
tissue-specific three-dimensional proximity of the two DNA break-
points) or to selection that connects tissue-specific regulatory elements 
with oncogenes13,41–43. The latter seems to be more likely because: (i) SRJs 
are associated with significant overexpression of only one of the rear-
rangement partners (the ‘primary locus’) relative to randomly selected 
rearrangements (primary locus, P < 10−4 (Fig. 3g left); secondary locus, 
P > 0.05 (Extended Data Fig. 9b left)); (ii) the rearrangement partner, 
in the secondary locus, tends to be highly expressed in that tissue type 
relative to others (Fig. 3g right); and (iii) the distance to the nearest 
tissue-specific enhancer is smaller for SRJs than for rearrangements 
overall (Extended Data Fig. 9b). These observations suggest that SRJs 
act in general by bringing regulatory elements to an oncogene that is 
otherwise expressed at a low level.
In many cases, SRJs generate truncated or chimeric proteins, and 
breakpoints within introns or exons were indeed overrepresented 
(68% versus 56% expected, P < 10−7). However, only 11 of the 30 (37%) 
most significant SRJs generated novel proteins in all samples, and 6 
others sometimes generated novel proteins; the rest were either non-
disruptive or contained breakpoints within the first two introns of the 
disrupted gene, leaving most of the protein intact44 (Fig. 3f). Moreover, 
SRJs that generate novel proteins exhibited expression changes similar 
to those that do not (P = 0.4) (Extended Data Fig. 9c). We conclude that 
altering gene expression is a key function of both classes of SRJs, and 
that SRJs are akin to non-coding driver point mutations that act on 
regulatory elements.
We found several SRJs that involve amplified oncogenes, including 
MDM2, EGFR and TERT (Fig. 3f, h, i, Extended Data Fig. 9d–f, Supple-
mentary Table 15). The TERT promoter region was juxtaposed in four 
melanomas (P < 10−7) to a region in the BASP1 gene (both on chromo-
some 5), and to a region near NDUFC2 (t(5,11)) in two melanomas and 
one medulloblastoma (P < 10−8). Both juxtaposed regions were marked 
with melanocyte enhancers, which suggests that they could drive TERT 
expression. Among melanomas, these rearrangements are mutually 
exclusive with the C228T and C250T mutations of the TERT promoter 
(P < 10−3) (Fig. 3h). Because the juxtapositions were always part of com-
plex events that also amplified TERT, increased TERT expression may 
be due to amplification, the juxtapositions or both.
Paucity of non-coding drivers in cancer
Our analyses of genomic hotspots, functional elements, genomic 
windows and SRJs all suggest that non-coding drivers are rare com-
pared to protein-coding drivers. This might, in part, be due to a lack 
of discovery power3. We therefore evaluated the discovery power of 
mutational-burden tests for recurrent events across the different types 
of element in our tumour cohorts, focusing first on point mutations3,16. 
We found that the fraction of mutated patients required for a driver 
to reach 90% discovery power ranged from <1% in large cohorts with 
low background-mutation densities to 25% in small cohorts with high 
background-mutation densities (Fig. 4a). Different types of element 
were similarly powered, suggesting that the paucity of drivers in non-
coding versus coding elements is not due to a lack of power. Similarly, 
our power to detect SRJs was higher in large cohorts with low rear-
rangement rates, and for long and interchromosomal rearrangements 
owing to their lower overall rates (Extended Data Fig. 10a): we were only 
powered to detect events that recur in 5–20% of samples in most types 
of cancer (Fig. 4b). Moreover, beginning with about 2,500 tumours, 
we expect to find a new SRJ with every 25 additional genomes (Fig. 4c).
Low sequencing coverage (for example, in GC-rich regions45) also 
limits driver discovery. To measure this effect in the PCAWG data, we 
quantified our ability to detect mutations (detection sensitivity)16 in 
cancer gene promoters. Although the mean detection sensitivity in 
promoters is high (41.9% of genomic positions have mean detection 
sensitivity >80% across tumours), only 4.1% of the promoters had detec-
tion sensitivity >90% in >90% of bases. In particular, the two canoni-
cal TERT promoter hotspots had highly variable detection sensitivity 
among patients and cohorts, from only 3% of patients in the central-
nervous-system pilocytic astrocytoma cohort to 100% in the thyroid 
adenocarcinoma cohort (Extended Data Fig. 10b). From these data, 
we inferred the expected number of TERT events in each tumour type 
(Extended Data Fig. 10c) and found that about 263 (95% confidence 
interval 232–295) TERT hotspot mutations were probably missed owing 
to a lack of detection sensitivity. Moreover, on average 9.9% (1.3–13.0% 
interquartile range) of the cancer gene promoter territory in the tumour 
of each patient was severely underpowered (an average detection sen-
sitivity of <10%). Therefore, the lack of coverage in promoters may 
contribute to the paucity of non-coding drivers.
To determine whether the paucity of non-coding drivers discov-
ered thus far could be due to the limited statistical power of current 
datasets, we estimated the overall excess of point mutations above 
background (that is, the expected number of driver events) in coding 
and cis-regulatory non-coding sequences in 603 cancer genes46 (Meth-
ods, Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Note 11). To minimize 
the effect of samples with low detection sensitivity, we included only 
936 samples with >90% detection sensitivity at the two TERT promoter 
hotspots (Extended Data Fig. 10c, d, Supplementary Note 11). Overall, 
this approach predicted more than 1,475 driver mutations (95% confi-
dence interval 1,410–1,687; 1,069 SNVs and 406 indels) in the protein-
coding sequences of these cancer genes (Fig. 4d), compared to only 
96 (95% confidence interval 30–190) estimated driver mutations in 
promoters (73 attributed to TERT), 22 (95% confidence interval 0–88) in 
5′UTRs, and 68 (95% confidence interval 0–178) in 3′ UTRs. Non-coding 
mutations in cancer-gene promoters were also not generally associ-
ated with loss-of-heterozygosity or altered expression, as one would 
expect if they were enriched with drivers (Supplementary Note 12).

These results collectively indicate that, independently of statistical 
power, non-coding cis-regulatory driver mutations in known cancer 
genes besides TERT are much less frequent than protein-coding drivers.
Discussion
The accurate and reliable discovery of genomic drivers in tumours may 
have critical implications for patients with cancer. Our findings and 
the methods introduced here for the discovery of point-mutation and 
structural-variant drivers, method integration, vetting of candidates 
and identification of local hypermutation and fragile sites represent 
an important contribution to the collective effort towards charting all 
malignant changes that drive the cancer of each patient5.
Among the most interesting candidate non-coding driver elements 
we uncovered are the 5′-end mutations in TP53; 3′ UTR mutations in 
NFKBIZ and TOB1; and rearrangements involving AKR1C genes and 
BRD4. By careful analysis of the whole-genome sequencing data, we 
found that several previously reported and frequently altered non-
coding elements may not be genuine drivers, including (i) the non-
coding RNAs, NEAT1 and MALAT1 (which contain a high density of indels, 
seemingly owing to a transcription-associated mutational process) and 
(ii) recurrent structural variants in regions of late replication, indicat-
ing DNA fragility.
This study yielded unexpectedly few non-coding driver point muta-
tions and structural variants. SRJs, which appear to act largely through 
the rearrangement of regulatory elements, are less frequent than 
SCNA-like SRBs, which directly amplify or delete coding sequences. 
The results from five analyses––hotspot recurrence, driver-element 
discovery, structural variants, discovery power and aggregated muta-
tional excess––suggest that this paucity is not caused by a particular 
analysis strategy, but that regulatory elements truly contribute a much 
smaller number of recurrent cancer-driving events than protein-coding 
sequences. This paucity of non-coding drivers contrasts with the dis-
tribution of germline polymorphisms associated with heritability of 
complex traits, which are most frequently located outside of protein-
coding genes47.
At least two factors contribute to the relative paucity of non-coding 
driver mutations in cancer: (i) the differential fitness effects of coding 
and non-coding mutations and (ii) the target size of functional ele-
ments. The paucity of promoter driver mutations in well-established

Number of patients required to ﬁnd driver
Fig. 4 | Power considerations and paucity of non-coding drivers. a, Heat map 
shows the minimal frequency of a driver element with ≥90% discovery power. 
Power is dependent on the background mutation frequency (above the heat 
map), the element length (median length depicted in Extended Data Fig. 2c) 
and the number of patients with mutations (cell numbers). For example, the 
pan-cancer cohort is powered to discover a protein-coding driver gene (coding 
sequence (CDS)) present in <1% (18 patients), whereas the Bladder–TCC cohort 
is only powered to discover drivers present in at least 27% (6 patients).  
b, Number of samples required to detect 90% of recurrent juxtapositions 
across 90% of pairs of loci, as a function of the median number of 
rearrangements per sample and the rate above background at which the fusion 
recurs (solid lines). The vertical dashed lines represent the median 
rearrangement rates of each cancer type, and the stars on these lines indicate 
the numbers of whole genomes analysed for that cancer type. c, Number of 
SRJs detected after downsampling the data to various sample sizes, separately 
indicating rearrangements that recur at high (≥12%; red) and low (<12%; black) 
rates above background; their sum (blue). d, Number of observed mutations 
(SNVs and indels) in cis-regulatory and coding regions of 603 protein-coding 
cancer genes with the expected numbers shown in lighter colours (left). Right, 
the number of excess mutations (that is, the estimated number of driver 
mutations) (right). The grey fraction of promoter mutations indicates TERT 
events. Error bars show 95% binomial confidence intervals. Only samples with 
high detection sensitivity were included (n = 936).

cancer genes suggests that point mutations markedly affect the func-
tion of non-coding regulatory elements only rarely. This highlights TERT 
as a notable exception, perhaps because even a modest increase in TERT 
expression may suffice to circumvent normal telomere shortening. 
For other cancer genes, directly mutating protein-coding sequences 
or altering expression levels by copy-number change may provide 
larger phenotypic effects. For example, complete loss-of-function 
by nonsense mutations or deletions may be easier to achieve than by 
disrupting or translocating regulatory regions.
Technical shortcomings (such as coverage ‘blind spots’ in GC-rich 
promoters and different filtering strategies) may cause genuine driv-
ers to be missed48. Therefore, the discovery of non-coding drivers will 
benefit from technical improvements, including even sequence cover-
age, longer and accurate reads, and improved variant-calling methods. 
Moreover, better annotation of functional non-coding elements will 
increase both the power to discover infrequently mutated driver ele-
ments and their interpretability. As datasets grow, yet-unidentified 
mutational mechanisms targeting particular genomic regions will 
emerge and require improved background models, including additional 
covariates and more-sophisticated statistical models. The analysis of 
structural variants has greater challenges because (i) accurately model-
ling their background density is complicated by their lower frequency 
and larger fraction of drivers (Supplementary Note 6); (ii) their target 
genes may be far from the breakpoints, as in SCNAs; (iii) the space for 
modelling SRJs is much larger (the genome squared); and (iv) many 
structural variants are part of complex events that often involve multi-
ple chromosomes31, so that the resultant topology cannot be deduced 
without technologies such as long- or linked-read sequencing49,50. For 
these reasons, experimental validation remains important for all—and 
especially for non-coding—candidate drivers.
Our work suggests that larger datasets and technological advances 
will continue to identify new non-coding drivers, albeit at considerably 
lower frequencies than protein-coding drivers. We anticipate that the 
approaches developed here will provide a solid foundation for the 
incipient era of driver discovery from ever-larger numbers of cancer 
whole genomes.

Methods
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The 
experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded 
to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
Detailed methods are provided as Supplementary Methods.
Dataset generation
Out of 2,955 samples, we selected 2,583 unique donor samples for SNV 
and indel driver-discovery analysis on the basis of SNV quality control 
(Supplementary Methods). We found that 110 additional myeloid–AML 
samples had robust structural variant calls despite SNV artefacts; we 
included these in structural variant analyses, for a total of 2,693 sam-
ples. For tumour-type cohort analyses, we used only cohorts with at 
least 20 patients. Tumour meta-cohorts were defined by cell type of 
origin or by organ system (for example, lung for lung adenocarcinoma 
and lung squamous cell carcinoma). A pan-cancer meta-cohort was 
created by combining all tumour cohorts except for Skin–Melanoma 
and lymphoid tumours (Supplementary Methods).
Hotspot SNV analysis
We selected the 50 most-frequent SNV hotspots. These were analysed 
to identify known driver events; mutational signature biases related 
to sequence palindromes, immunoglobulin loci and so on; and poten-
tial artefacts, including regional mapping problems (Supplementary 
Methods).
Mutational signatures
We performed de novo global-signature discovery and signature 
attributions with SignatureAnalyzer’s Bayesian non-negative matrix 
factorization method52, based on 1,697 channels—including 1,536 
pentanucleotide sequence contexts for single-base substitutions, 83 
indel features, and 78 doublet-nucleotide substitution classes (Sup-
plementary Methods).
Definition of genomic elements
GENCODE v.19 (ref.53) and other genomic resources were used to define 
functional genomic elements, including protein-coding genes (CDS, 
splice sites, 5′ UTR, 3′ UTR and promoters), long non-coding RNAs (gene 
body, splice site and promoters), short RNAs, miRNAs and enhancers 
(Supplementary Methods).
Candidate-driver-mutation identification methods and 
combination of results
We obtained results (P values) from 13 methods of driver discovery, 
including ActiveDriverWGS54, CompositeDriver, DriverPower55, 
dndscv46, ExInAtor56, LARVA57, MutSig tools3, NBR10, ncdDetect58, 
ncDriver59, OncodriveFML60 and regDriver61. We integrated the results 
of all these methods using a custom framework based on a previously 
published method62 for combining P values. Results from individual 
methods that showed large deviations from the expected uniform null 
distribution of P values were excluded. This approach was evaluated on 
real and simulated data. We controlled the FDR within each of the sets 
of tested genomic elements by concatenating all combined Brown’s 
P values from across all tumour-type cohorts and applying the Ben-
jamini–Hochberg procedure63. Cohort–element combinations with 
Q values < 0.1 were designated as significant hits, and combinations 
with 0.1 ≤ Q < 0.25 as ‘near significance’. Extensive details are provided 
in the Supplementary Methods. In addition, we tested for element-
independent recurrence with the NBR method on 2-kb bins spanning 
the entire genome, and non-coding ultraconserved regions64.
Post-filtering of driver mutation candidates
We applied stringent filters to discern positive selection from tech-
nical artefacts and mutational processes. We required at least three 
mutations to be present in candidate elements, in at least three patients 
of the tested cohort; more than 50% of mutations in mappable regions; 
less than 50% of mutations in palindromic DNA; and less than 50% of 
mutations attributed to APOBEC activity. For lymphoid tumours and 
skin melanoma, we required that <35% and <50% of mutations were 
attributed to the AID and UV-light mutational signatures, respectively. 
The FDR was recalculated after post-filtering.
Candidate driver structural-variant analyses
We applied separate analyses to detect recurrent structural variant 
breakpoints and recurrent juxtapositions. For each analysis, we first 
binned breakpoints, accepting only one breakpoint per sample per bin. 
We then determined which bins had more breakpoints than expected by 
chance (the SRB analysis), and which pairs of bins (or ‘tiles’) were joined 
by more rearrangements than expected by chance (the SRJ analysis).
Candidate driver breakpoints
We calculated the background rate of breakpoints per bin based on 
a Gamma–Poisson model15 that took into account genomic covari-
ates, breakpoint counts normalized by the number of bases within 
each bin that had sufficient mappability to be eligible for breakpoint 
detection and accounted for an observed overdispersion of breakpoint 
counts that probably reflects unaccounted-for covariates (Supple-
mentary Methods). We used the Gamma–Poisson model to calculate 
the P value for each bin (that is, the probability that each bin would 
exhibit the observed number of breakpoints (or greater) by chance 
alone), applying the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure63 to correct for 
multiple hypotheses.
Post-filtering of driver breakpoint candidates
We scored each recurrent breakpoint locus on the basis of the average 
replication timing of its breakpoints, and filtered those loci with scores 
>0.5 as probable fragile sites65.
Candidate driver juxtapositions
We developed a background model to indicate the probability that two 
loci would be joined, taking into account the observed rate at which 
each locus underwent DNA breaks (from the breakpoint analysis), the 
distance between them and the propensity for these rearrangements 
to reflect a break followed by invasion versus two breaks that were then 
joined. We determined the probability that each tile would contain the 
observed number of rearrangements using a binomial test, followed 
by controlling for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–
Hochberg procedure63.
Gene-expression analyses
Gene-expression data were provided by the PCAWG Transcriptome 
Core Group66, and also generated using the same approach for an 
extended set of non-coding transcripts (Supplementary Methods).
Additional evidence for selection
In addition to associations between mutations or structural variants 
and expression, we looked for signals of copy-number-alteration recur-
rence using the GISTIC2 algorithm67. We also tested whether driver can-
didates showed significantly higher frequency of loss-of-heterozygosity 
in mutated samples using Fisher’s exact test. We calculated cancer 
allelic fractions using ploidy and tumour purity predictions from a 
previous publication68.
Mutational process and indel enrichment
For every gene, we calculated the proportion of indels of length 2–5 
bp out of the total number of indels. This proportion was compared 
to the genome background proportion using a binomial test. We also 
compared the indel rate per gene (not distinguishing by length) to the 
background. Both sets of P values were corrected with the FDR method.

Power calculations
We estimated our power to discover driver elements mutated at a par-
ticular frequency in the population as previously described3,16, but 
solving for the lowest frequency for a driver element in the patient 
population that is powered (≥90%) for discovery. The calculation of this 
lowest frequency takes into account (i) the average background muta-
tion frequencies for each cohort–element combination; (ii) the median 
length and average detection sensitivity for each element type and 
patient cohort size; and (iii) a global desired false-positive rate of 10%. 
The effect of element length is discussed in Supplementary Note 10, and 
details are provided in Supplementary Methods. Power calculations for 
detection of recurrent juxtapositions was performed similarly, except 
over a two-dimensional genomic fusion map divided into 100 × 100-kb 
tiles (Supplementary Methods). We performed this analysis first as a 
function of the distance between breakpoints (Extended Data Fig. 10a) 
and second as a function of the median number of rearrangements per 
sample, spanning values represented by histologies with more than 15 
samples (Fig. 4b).
Estimation of the number of mutations in non-coding regions of 
known cancer genes
NBR was used to estimate the background mutation rate expected 
across cancer genes, using a conservative list of 19,082 putative passen-
ger genes as background and including as covariates the local mutation 
rate, gene expression and averaged copy-number states. The resulting 
model predicted the number of passenger SNVs and indels expected 
by chance. By aggregating the expected numbers over 603 known 
cancer genes from the CGC69 (CGC v.80) (Supplementary Table 7), we 
compared the observed and expected numbers of mutations. For this 
analysis, we excluded samples with problems of low detection sensitiv-
ity (Supplementary Methods).

data access policies of the ICGC and TCGA projects, most molecular, 
clinical and specimen data are in an open tier that does not require 
access approval. To access information that could potentially identify 
participants, such as germline alleles and the underlying sequencing 
data, researchers will need to apply to the TCGA data access committee 
via dbGaP (https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login) 
for access to the TCGA portion of the dataset, and to the ICGC data 
access compliance office (http://icgc.org/daco) for the ICGC portion 
of the dataset. In addition, to access somatic single-nucleotide vari-
ants derived from TCGA donors, researchers will also need to obtain 
dbGaP authorization.

2D model. Higher robustness values represent lower susceptibility to 
unaccounted variations in the background model. The top 48 SRJs have a 
robustness factor greater than 2, which suggests that these SRJs would remain 
significant even if the true background rate was twice as high as our model 
estimates. Right, the effect size is calculated as the difference in observed and 
estimated number of SRJs in units of standard deviation (assuming binomial 
distribution of structural variant count per 2D genomic region). Most SRJs are 
well above ten standard deviations of the predicted value. b, Characteristics of 
SRJ secondary loci. Left, fold expression enrichment of the most highly 
overexpressed gene in the secondary locus in cancer samples with these 
fusions relative to cancers of the same histology without the fusion. Right, the 
distance from the SRJ secondary locus (green) to the nearest enhancer is 
significantly smaller (P < 0.05; two-sided t-test) compared to randomly 
selected breakpoints (grey). c, Fold expression enrichment of the most highly 
overexpressed gene in the primary locus, for fusions that disrupt protein-
coding sequences and fusions that do not. All box plots show the interquartile 
range, median and 95% confidence interval. d, Rearrangements between the 
TERT promoter and the BASP1 and MYO10 locus result in focal amplification of 
TERT and relocation of distal enhancers to TERT. e, TERT-NDUFC2 fusion in two 
melanoma samples connecting TERT with an enhancer-rich region next to 
NDUFC2. Both samples also have focal amplifications of TERT. f, Recurrent 
translocation between EGFR in chromosome 7 and the KL and STARD13 locus on 
chromosome 13. In all three samples, the rearrangement contributed to the 
amplification of EGFR.

Extended Data Fig. 10 | A lack of detection power in specific elements.  
a, Number of tumour–normal pairs needed to detect fusions with 90% power as 
a function of the span of the fusion and the rate above background at which it 
recurs. The red asterisks indicate the numbers of samples required to detect 
100-kb and 100-Mb fusions that recur at 0.5% above their background rates.  
b, Distribution of TERT promoter hotspot (top, chromosome 5: 1,295,228; 
bottom, chromosome 5: 1,295,250; hg19) detection sensitivity for each patient, 
by cohort. Grey dots indicate values for individual patients inside estimated 
distribution (areas coloured by cohort). Horizontal black bars mark the 
medians. Numbers above distributions indicate the percentage of patients 
powered (detection sensitivity ≥ 90%) in each cohort. Cohort sizes as in Fig. 4a. 
c, Percentage of patients with observed (blue) and inferred missed (red) 
mutations at the chromosome 5: 1,295,228 and chromosome 5: 1,295,250 TERT 
promoter hotspot sites. Error bars indicate 95% Poisson confidence interval. 
Numbers above bars show the total inferred number of TERT promoter 
mutations for each site in this cohort. Red numbers indicate the absolute 
number of inferred missed mutations (owing to a lack of read coverage). 
Cohort sizes as in Fig. 4a. d, Detection sensitivity for the two TERT promoter 
hotspots across all samples showing the variation in powered samples. Red 
vertical line (x = 0.9) indicates cutoff for ‘sufficiently powered samples’.  
e, Mean detection sensitivity in 1,000 randomly selected putative passengers 
(pass) and 603 cancer genes (driv) across element types: promoters, 5′ UTRs, 
CDS and 3′ UTRs. The left panel shows the results for all samples and the right 
panel corresponds to the set of samples with high sensitivity at TERT hotspots. 
Boxes show the interquartile range and median; outliers are shown as circles. 
Weighted sensitivity means are shown at the top of the box plot.

Extended Data Fig. 11 | P value combination details. a, Quantile–quantile 
plots of P values reported by various driver-detection algorithms on the three 
simulated datasets (Broad, DKFZ and Sanger; shown for coding regions 
(n = 20,172) in the meta-carcinoma cohort; see Methods for details for the 
statistical background model or test of each algorithm) showed no major 
enrichment of mutations above the background rate. Results generally 
followed the expected null (uniform) distribution, and the P values reported on 
simulated data were subsequently used to assess the covariance of method 
results. b, Quantile–quantile plots of integrated P values using the Brown and 
Fisher methods for combining P values across the results from different driver-
detection algorithms were generated for a few representative tumour cohorts 
(shown here for coding regions). Brown combined P values (light blue) 
generally followed the null distribution as expected, whereas Fisher combined 
P values were significantly inflated (dark blue), confirming that dependencies 
existed between the results reported by the various driver-detection 
algorithms. To simplify the integration procedure, we calculated covariances 
using P values from the observed data instead of simulated data and found that 
the integrated results based on the observed covariances (first column of 
plots) were essentially the same as the results obtained using the simulated 
covariances (second, third, and fourth columns of plots). c, Triangular heat 
maps showing the Spearman correlations of P values among the various driver-
detection methods in observed versus simulated data (coding regions 
(n = 20,172), colorectal adenocarcinoma cohort) are highly similar. Differences 
in the observed and simulated correlation values (shown in the heat maps on 
the far right) were minimal, and thus the final integration of P values across 
methods was performed using covariances estimated on observed data.  
d, Brown combined P values based on observed and simulated covariance 
estimations (shown on the right, top heat map, for coding regions in 
glioblastoma) did not differ noticeably. In cases in which individual methods 
reported results that yielded substantially fewer hits than the median across all 
methods (bottom heat map, methods in light grey with results in dashed box), 
removing the methods from the integration did not affect the number of 
significant genes identified (right column of results in bottom heat map, shown 
for coding regions in lung adenocarcinoma). Number of coding regions as in c.
