ABSTRACT
◥
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common
cancer types and has various treatment options. Better biomar-
kers to predict therapeutic response are needed to guide choice of
treatment modality and to improve precision medicine. Here, we
used a consensus hierarchical clustering approach on 509 LUAD
cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify ﬁve robust
LUAD expression subtypes. Genomic and proteomic data from
patient samples and cell lines was then integrated to help deﬁne
biomarkers of response to targeted therapies and immunothera-
pies. This approach deﬁned subtypes with unique proteogenomic
and dependency proﬁles. Subtype 4 (S4)–associated cell lines
exhibited speciﬁc vulnerability to loss of CDK6 and CDK6-cyclin
D3 complex gene (CCND3). Subtype 3 (S3) was characterized by
dependency on CDK4, immune-related expression patterns, and
altered MET signaling. Experimental validation showed that S3-
associated cell lines responded to MET inhibitors, leading to
increased expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). In
an independent real-world patient dataset, patients with S3
tumors were enriched with responders to immune checkpoint
blockade. Genomic features in S3 and S4 were further identiﬁed
as biomarkers for enabling clinical diagnosis of these subtypes.
Overall, our consensus hierarchical clustering approach identi-
ﬁed robust tumor expression subtypes, and our subsequent
integrative analysis of genomics, proteomics, and CRISPR
screening data revealed subtype-speciﬁc biology and vulnerabil-
ities. These LUAD expression subtypes and their biomarkers
could help identify patients likely to respond to CDK4/6, MET, or
PD-L1 inhibitors, potentially improving patient outcome.
Signiﬁcance: Integrative analysis of multiomic and drug depen-
dency data uncovers robust lung adenocarcinoma expression sub-
types with unique therapeutic vulnerabilities and subtype-speciﬁc
biomarkers of response.
High-resolution LUAD subtypes partition the known proximal inﬂammatory subtype and identiﬁes subtype-speciﬁc outcome,
therapeutic targets, vulnerabilities, and clinically applicable biomarkers.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the most prevalent cause of death from cancer
worldwide (1). The two major histologic classes of lung cancer are: (i)
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and (ii) small cell lung cancer.
NSCLC is the most common histologic type and is further divided into
two major subtypes: lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squa-
mous cell carcinoma (LSCC, previously termed “LUSC”). Previous
studies classiﬁed LUAD into molecular subtypes based on geno-
mic (2, 3, 4) and proteogenomic (5) proﬁling of tumors and then

associated these subtypes with clinical outcomes. Two of the largest
published studies on LUAD subtypes are: (i) the original The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUAD subtyping paper published in 2014 that
used 230 patients (the largest number of patients available at the time)
to identify three subtypes based on mRNA expression—proximal
inﬂammatory (PI), proximal proliferative (PP), and terminal respira-
tory unit (TRU; ref. 2); and (ii) the TCGA Pan-Lung study in 2017 that
analyzed both the LSCC and LUAD cohort and identiﬁed 8 subtypes, 6
of which are enriched with LUAD tumors (4). To date, the TCGA
LUAD cohort has increased to a total of 509 LUAD cases, offering
increased power to identify higher resolution subtypes.
Robust LUAD subtyping can substantially aid in determining the
most effective therapies that target subtype-speciﬁc vulnerabilities.
Thus far, molecular therapies for LUAD have focused on targeting
various genomic alterations, such as the RAS/RAF/RTK pathway.
These include therapies targeting EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 alterations,
as well as the more recently approved therapies such as those, targeting
MET, RET, NTRK1/2, BRAF kinases, and KRASG12C mutations (6, 7).
Moreover, additional therapies are currently still under development,
such as ERBB2 inhibitors (8). Recently, immune checkpoint blockades
(ICB) have been approved to treat lung cancer, including inhibitors for
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; pembrolizumab and nivo-
lumab) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; atezolizumab and
durvalumab). Previously reported biomarkers of response or resis-
tance to immunotherapy in LUAD include PD-L1 expression (9, 10),
tumor mutational burden (TMB; refs. 11, 12, 13), mismatch repair
deﬁciency/microsatellite instability (14), and STK11 mutation (15).
However, most LUAD tumors continue to progress on therapy,
underscoring the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Therefore,
more precise and robust subtyping of LUAD tumors and their
association with speciﬁc treatments can help improve patient prog-
nosis and outcome.
In this study, to more precisely deﬁne therapeutically relevant
LUAD subtypes, we integrated multiple data sets (Fig. 1A): (i) the
full 509 LUAD patient cohort in TCGA; (ii) vulnerability data in
LUAD cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE;
refs. 16, 17) and the dependency map (DepMap; ref. 18) repositories;
(iii) an independent cohort from the Samsung Medical Center (SMC)
including 164 patients with response to ICB therapy; and (iv) prote-
omic data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium
(CPTAC) cohort of 110 patients with LUAD (5). We show that our
analysis indeed yielded distinct subtypes compared with the previously
published expression-based subtypes, with higher-resolution parti-
tioning of previously deﬁned subtypes. Moreover, our experimental
work in vitro highlights potential subtype-speciﬁc therapeutic targets,
and we identify a small number of biomarkers that could be used in the
clinic to classify patients into our most clinically relevant subtypes,
which could help guide clinical decision making.
Materials and Methods
Ethics approval and consent to participate
All datasets analyzed are publicly available. Ethics approval and
consent were obtained in the original papers as required. The Korean
LUAD immunotherapy cohort study was approved by the SMC
Institutional Review Board (IRB; SMC 2018–03–130 and SMC
2013–10–112), and informed written consent was obtained from all
patients enrolled in the study.
TCGA LUAD data
In this study, we used the full LUAD TCGA dataset including 509
samples. Batch-corrected upper quartile normalized RNA-seq by
Expectation-Maximization (RSEM) data for TCGA LUAD cohort
(level 3) was obtained from the PanCanAtlas study (19). TCGA LUAD
somatic mutation call data (level 2) was obtained from the MC3
("Multi-Center Mutation Calling in Multiple Cancers") data repository
(https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/mc3–2017).
TCGA
LUAD copy-number segmentation ﬁle (level 3) (LUAD.snp__geno-
me_wide_snp_6__broad_mit_edu__Level_3__segmented_scna_mi-
nus_germline_cnv_hg19__seg.seg.txt) was obtained from Firehose
(doi:10.7908/C11G0KM9). Survival data for TCGA LUAD samples
was obtained from the integrated TCGA pan-cancer clinical data (20).
CCLE LUAD cell line data
The ‘omics data and CRISPR knockout data for CCLE LUAD cell
line samples were obtained from the DepMap portal (https://depmap.
org/portal/; DepMap Public 21Q2 dataset; ref. 18). Of the 1,379 cell
lines available, we used 78 LUAD cell lines.
CPTAC LUAD data
Data used in this publication were generated by the NCI CPTAC.
Genomics and proteomics data for CPTAC LUAD samples were
obtained from the previous study (5).
In this study, we included the full CPTAC LUAD cohort including
110 patients. We used the processed tables from the original study,
speciﬁcally the two-component-normalized log2-transformed protein
and phosphosite expression tables (5). From this previous study (5),
10,699 expressed proteins and 41,188 phosphorylation sites were
detected and analyzed in the current study.
SMC LUAD data
Samples from histologically conﬁrmed patients with NSCLC ade-
nocarcinoma who were treated with either PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors
were collected. Patients with samples available for the whole tran-
scriptome sequencing (WTS) were included in the analyses. The data
from 164 patients with WTS results were used. Clinical information
was collected from patients’ electronic medical records. Tumor
response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors version 1.1. Patients with complete/partial response were
considered “responsive” to therapy. Patients with progressive disease
or stable disease were considered “non-responsive” to therapy. PD-L1
IHC results were recorded on the basis of tumor proportional score
using the 22C3 pharmDx antibody (Agilent). This study was con-
ducted with the approval of the SMC (IRB number: 2018–03–130).
RNA was puriﬁed from formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded or fresh
tumor samples using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA
concentration and purity were measured using the NanoDrop
and Bioanalyzer (Agilent). The library was prepared following the
manufacturer’s instructions using either the TruSeq RNA Library Prep
Kit v2 (Illumina) or the TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep Kit
(Illumina). FASTQ ﬁles were mapped against hg19 using the 2-pass
mode of STAR version 2.4.0. The ﬁrst-pass-aligned reads to the
hg19 genome reference were used to generate the sample-speciﬁc
reference. The second pass was used to align the reads to the newly
generated hg19 genome and the sample-speciﬁc reference. Raw read
counts mapped to genes were analyzed for transcript abundance using
RSEM version 1.2.18 and to get a transcripts per million (TPM) value.
ComBat was used to merge gene expression generated with different
platforms to eliminate batch effects between different kits.

approach was applied to the log2(RSEM) TCGA LUAD gene expres-
sion data of n ¼ 509 samples as described previously (22, 23, 24). In
brief, for the preprocessing step, the genes with not available (NA)
values in more than 10% across samples were removed, and the top
25% most varying genes (based on the SD of gene expression across
samples) were selected. The resulting matrix R (3,619 by 509) was then
transformed to the matrix R of fold changes centered at the median
expression. Using the distance matrix of 1 - C (Cij represents the
Spearman correlation between sample i and j across 3,619 genes in R),
a consensus matrix, MK, was computed by iterating a standard
hierarchical clustering K  500 times with the average linkage method
and 80% resampling in sample space (Mij represents the number of co-
clustering of sample i and j. K represents the number of clusters). Next,
the cumulative consensus matrix, M, was computed by summing up all
MK with K increasing from 2 to 10. The normalized M was obtained
by normalizing M with the total number of iterations. For selection of
optimal number of clusters, K, that best explain the observed M,
BayesNMF with a half-normal prior was applied so that the best
approximation of M  HTH could be found, where hkj in H (K by N)
represents a clustering afﬁnity or an association of the sample j to the
cluster k. Twenty-three of 50 independent BayesNMF runs with
different initial conditions converged to the solution of K ¼ 5.
Therefore, K ¼ 5 was chosen as the optimal number of clusters. To
provide additional internal validation for the robustness of the sub-
types and test the effect of having fewer discovery samples, we
performed re-clustering of downsampled datasets of sizes N ¼
200,220,. . .,500 from our full discovery cohort (n ¼ 509). We per-
formed 10 random downsamplings per value of N (“runs”); within
each run, we performed 30 independent BayesNMF iterations (each
initialized with a unique random seed) and selected the best number
of clusters (denoted by K) following the BayesNMF criteria. K ¼ 5
or K ¼ 4 was the dominant solutions for most of the tested
downsampling sizes, and K ¼ 5 was the solely dominant solution
as the downsampled cohort size increased to N ¼ 480 and 500 (See
Results section Genomic characterization reveals ﬁve LUAD expres-
sion subtypes).
Subtype projection in independent cohorts (CCLE, CPTAC, SMC)
Expression
subtype
classiﬁers
were
derived
as
previously
described (23). In brief, the subtype-speciﬁc marker genes were
selected by performing an additional nonnegative matrix factorization
to the log2(RSEM) gene expression data X with the ﬁxed K and H (a
column-wise normalization of H) to determine the optimal W (20,502
by K) in X WH, where wik represents an inferred association of the
gene i to the cluster k. The genes with clustering association with any
clusters higher than 0.5 were considered as subtype-speciﬁc marker
genes. Next, the clustering membership of the gene i was determined
by the maximum association criterion as k ¼ maxk [wik] (k ¼ 1
through K) [285 candidate subtype-speciﬁc marker genes for Subtype
1 (S1); 637 genes for Subtype 2 (S2); 397 genes for Subtype 3 (S3);
864 genes for Subtype 4 (S4); and 513 genes for Subtype 5 (S5)]. The
subtype-speciﬁc marker genes were deﬁned as the top 100 genes in
descending order of wik, with dik ≥0.5, where dik is the mean difference
of log2 fold change between samples in the cluster k and other samples.
The association of samples from CCLE, CPTAC, or SMC RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) samples to the TCGA LUAD expression sub-
types (normalized hnew matrix) was determined by modeling the gene
expression matrix of CCLE/CPTAC/SMC RNA-seq samples Xnew
conditioned on WTCGA to best approximate Xnew  WTCGA hnew
for the differentially overexpressed subtype markers (100 marker genes
in each subtype) in TCGA LUAD expression subtypes. CCLE RNA-
seq samples were assigned to one of the ﬁve identiﬁed TCGA LUAD
expression subtypes if the normalized association (normalized hnew
matrix) with one of the TCGA subtypes was larger than 0.6. Because
there were not enough cell lines representing subtypes, a cutoff of 0.5
was used with the additional requirement that the difference of the
normalized association values between the highest subtype and the
second highest subtype was larger than 0.2. Using these thresholds, we
conﬁdently assigned 30 cell lines to S3 and 16 cell lines into S4.
CPTAC/SMC RNA-seq samples were assigned to one of the ﬁve
identiﬁed TCGA LUAD expression subtypes if the normalized asso-
ciation (normalized hnew matrix) with one of the TCGA subtypes was
larger than 0.6 (the cutoff of 0.6 instead of 0.5 was used to be more
conservative). The subtype projection code is available on GitHub
(https://github.com/getzlab/LUAD_subtypes) so that any indepen-
dent LUAD expression samples can be projected to our LUAD
expression subtypes using our subtype projection code as a single
sample classiﬁer.
Mutation signiﬁcance analysis
MutSig2CV (25, 26) was applied to identify signiﬁcantly mutated
genes (Q value ≤0.1) (impute_full_cov_when_promotes_signiﬁcance
¼ false, max_neighbors ¼ 1000, num_neighbor_patients ¼ 1, qual_
min ¼ 0.1, enforce_target_list ¼ true), and GISTIC 2.0 (27) was
applied to identify signiﬁcant focal copy-number alterations in a
cohort of samples of interest (all TCGA LUAD samples, each of ﬁve
TCGA LUAD expression subtypes; Ampliﬁcation Threshold ¼ 0.1,
Deletion Threshold ¼ 0.1, Cap Values ¼ 1.5, Broad Length Cutoff ¼
0.5, Remove X-Chromosome ¼ 0, Conﬁdence Level ¼ 0.99, Join
Segment Size ¼ 4, Arm Level Peel Off ¼ 1, Maximum Sample
Segments ¼ 2000). Gene ampliﬁcation in TCGA LUAD was based
on the entries having values of þ2 (high-level threshold) or þ1 (low-
level threshold) in the ‘all_thresholded.by_genes.txt’ from GISTIC 2.0.
Gene deletion in TCGA LUAD was based on the entries having values
of –2 (high-level threshold) or –1 (low-level threshold) in the ‘all_-
thresholded.by_genes.txt’ from GISTIC 2.0. Gene ampliﬁcation and
deletion in CCLE LUAD was based on a log2 copy-number ratio
threshold of 0.3. Due to small sample size of CPTAC LUAD cohort
(n ¼1 for S1, n ¼ 2 for S2, n ¼ 13 for S3, and n ¼ 13 for S4), MutSig2CV
and GISTIC 2.0 could not be applied for the CPTAC LUAD cohort. As
an alternative, the proportion of samples with recurrent somatic copy-
number alterations (SCNA) in the TCGA LUAD cohort with those in
the CPTAC LUAD cohort was compared.
Pathway analysis
Single-sample gene set variance analysis (GSVA) was performed on
the log2(RSEM) TCGA LUAD gene expression data, CPTAC LUAD
gene expression data (TPM), and SMC LUAD gene expression data
(TPM) using the gsva function (method ¼ "gsva", mx.diff ¼ TRUE)
from the R package ‘GSVA’ (v.1.30.0). For the SMC data, we performed
GSVA using the expression data after removing batch effects. GSVA
implements a nonparametric method of gene set enrichment
to generate an enrichment score for each gene set within a sample.
The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) gene sets v.6.1 were
used to represent broad biological processes. The pathways with
signiﬁcantly different activities across the subtypes were identiﬁed
based on (i) Q < 0.05 and (ii) mean difference of GSVA enrichment
scores between subtypes of interest versus all other samples > 0.2
or < –0.2.

clinicopathologic variables were obtained from an integrated TCGA
pan-cancer clinical data resource (20). Cox proportional hazard
multivariate analysis was performed using the coxph function in the
R package ‘survival’ (v.2.43–1).
Subtype-speciﬁc cancer vulnerability analysis
The CERES scores (gene dependency scores) obtained from the
Cancer DepMap were used as the measure of cancer vulnerability in
cell lines. CERES score is a computational method that estimates the
dependency of each tested cell line to a given gene knockout. Con-
ventionally, CERES scores are interpreted as follows: a score of 0
indicates that the gene is not essential in a given cell line, and a –1 score
is highly dependent on the given gene (e.g., common essential genes),
whereas scores < –0.5 are considered as the cutoff for dependency. For
subtype-speciﬁc cancer vulnerability analysis, only the LUAD driver
oncogenes (genes with recurrent point mutations, indels, and SCNAs)
identiﬁed from this study (n ¼ 21) were tested. Top genes with
subtype-speciﬁc cancer vulnerabilities were selected as the genes
that meet the following two criteria: (i) We check for dependency,
ensuring that each of the driver genes has a median CERES score lower
than –0.5 in the subtype of interest, reﬂecting the fact that the cell lines
of this subtype are dependent on the gene, (ii) We check for speciﬁcity
by requiring that the genes should have a median CERES score in the
subtype of interest at least 0.2 lower than the other cell lines. The
common essential genes (Achilles common essential genes) were
ﬁltered out from the top gene list. P values were calculated using the
Wilcoxon rank sum test.
Biomarker analysis
Biomarker discovery was performed by applying lasso logistic
regression on either gene expression data or reverse-phase protein
array (RPPA) data (level 4 RPPA data were obtained from the Cancer
Proteome Atlas Portal) from the TCGA LUAD cohort (randomly split
into 80% training data and 20% test data) to predict subtypes of interest
(S3 vs. others or S4 vs. others). For gene expression data, 100 subtype
marker genes were used as the potential features to test. The best
lambda value was chosen to minimize the prediction error rate using
the cv.glmnet() function in the R package ‘glmnet’ (v.4.1–1). Threshold
values from 0.1 to 1 in increments of 0.1 were tested for the best
threshold selection that maximizes AUC values. Accuracy of the model
was based on the agreement of the predicted subtypes and the true
subtype label in the test data. To generate the 5-feature models, we
forced the model to reduce the number of features down to ﬁve by
increasing the lambda value that controls the amount of the coefﬁcient
shrinkage.
Antibodies and reagents
The following antibody was used for immunoﬂuorescence
staining: Recombinant Alexa Fluor 488 anti–PD-L1 antibody
(ab209959). DAPI was used for nuclear staining (10236276001;
Sigma-Aldrich). C-Met inhibitor tivantinib was purchased from
Selleck Chemicals. CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (PD 0332991
isethionate) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. CDK4/6 Inhib-
itor IV (CAS 359886–84–3) was purchased from Calbiochem.
Cell cultures
Cell lines described in this study were received from Dr. Matthew
Meyerson’s lab at the Broad Institute. The Meyerson lab received
the ABC1 and NCIH1833 cell lines directly from the CCLE and they
were authenticated as part of their common processing. All other
listed cell lines were proﬁled by single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) ﬁngerprinting at the time of screening. SNP ﬁngerprinting
matches a panel of reference SNP genotypes for each known cell
line. The reference set of SNP genotypes used was derived from
the Affymetrix SNP6.0 array birdseed genotypes from the CCLE
project. Tests for Mycoplasma contamination were performed upon
arrival at the Getz Lab (December 2020), and cell lines were
screened for mycoplasma contamination at least quarterly.
On the basis of the subtype projection, we used 4 cell lines from
the S3 subtype (HCC78, HCC827, NCIH1975, NCIH1838), 3 from
the S4 subtype (NCIH1395, NCIH1833, NCIH1755), and two that
were assigned to other subtypes (ABC1 – S1; CALU3 – S5). Cells
were maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. For each experiment, cell lines
were thawed and undergone 2 to 3 passages before the indicated
experiments.
Proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in duplicate (1  104 cells/well in 96-well plates)
and treated with DMSO, 3 mmol/L tivantinib (a non–ATP-competitive
c-Met inhibitor that induces G2–M arrest and apoptosis), CDK4/6
inhibitor (palbociclib-CDK4 concentration, 11 nmol/L; CDK4/6 con-
centration, 16 nmol/L), or 1.5 mmol/L CDK4/6 Inhibitor IV
(CAS359886–84–3, a triaminopyrimidine compound that acts as a
reversible and ATP-competitive inhibitor; abbreviated here as
CINK4). Different cell lines have a varying growth rate; therefore,
the media and drugs were replenished at different times for each cell
line, either when the cell line conﬂuency reached 60% [measured using
IncuCyte or by the PAULA Cell Imager (Leica)] or after 3 days from
the last media and drug replenishing. Continuous cell growth was
monitored in 96-well plates every 3 hours for 4 days using the IncuCyte
Kinetic Imaging System. The relative conﬂuency was analyzed using
IncuCyte software. The reported response percentage for each cell line
was calculated as the percent of conﬂuency compared with a DMSO-
treated control counterpart. Proliferation assays were repeated 4 times.
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
Cells were seeded in duplicate (5  104 cells/well in 24 well plates),
treated with DMSO or 3 mmol/L of tivantinib, and grown for 2 to
3 days. Cells were then ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes
and washed twice in cold PBS. Fluor 488 Anti–PD-L1 antibody was
added for a 1 hour incubation in a light-protected environment at
room temperature followed by staining the nuclei with DAPI. Fluo-
rescence images were captured using Invitrogen EVOS FL Imaging
System by Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc. The increase in ﬂuorescence was
further quantiﬁed using ImageJ software.
Immune phenotype analysis based on hematoxylin and eosin
image
Immune phenotyping of tumor microenvironment was conducted
by applying Lunit SCOPE IO, an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)-powered
spatial tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocyte (TIL) analysis as published
previously (28). Brieﬂy, the AI model detected TIL and segmentized
cancer area and cancer stroma. It then deﬁned microscopic immune
phenotype (IP) in 1 mm2-sized grid-level as follows: immune-inﬂamed
was deﬁned as TIL density in the cancer area above the threshold
(106/mm2); immune-excluded was deﬁned as TIL density in the
cancer area below the threshold, and TIL density in the cancer stroma
area above the threshold (357/mm2); and immune-desert was deﬁned
as the TIL density in the cancer area and that in the cancer stroma
area both below the thresholds. Inﬂamed, immune-excluded, and
immune-desert scores of whole slide image (WSI) were deﬁned by
Roh et al.

the number of grids annotated to a certain IP divided by the total
number of grids analyzed in the WSI. We deﬁned macroscopic IP in
WSI-level, as follows: immune-inﬂamed IP as inﬂamed score ≥33.3%,
otherwise immune-excluded IP as immune-excluded score ≥33.3%,
otherwise immune-desert IP.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using R. Statistical tests included a
two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and x2 test.
Data availability
For this study, we used publicly available data from multiple
resources: (i) human tumor tissue data (from the TCGA cohort,
https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), (ii) proteomic data from CPTAC
(https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edU/cptac/s/S056), and (iii) cell
line data (via the DependencyMap, https://depmap.org/portal/). In
addition, we used a LUAD immunotherapy cohort data from
Korean patients at SMC for validation. All raw and processed
sequencing data generated in this study have been submitted to
the European Nucleotide Archive (https://ega-archive.org/) under
accession number EGAS00001006461. Analysis scripts used in this

Results
Genomic characterization reveals ﬁve LUAD expression
subtypes
Because previous studies showed that expression data are the most
predictive genomic features of cancer dependencies (18), we sought to
identify robust and novel expression subtypes that can be potentially
associated with cancer vulnerabilities. Applying a consensus clustering
approach using BayesNMF to the expression data representing the 509
LUAD cases from TCGA, similar to the approach we used for bladder
cancer (22), revealed ﬁve LUAD expression subtypes, designated S1 to
S5 (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S1).
To further explore our expression subtypes, we compared them to
the previously deﬁned LUAD expression subtypes—PI, PP, and TRU
(Supplementary Note 1; ref. 2). Among the 230 TCGA LUAD tumors,
we found that S5 was most closely related to the TRU subtype [77.4% of
S5 tumors were from the TRU subtype, and 80.9% of TRU subtype
mapped to S5 (Fisher exact test, P ¼ 3.31024)], and S4 was enriched
with the PP subtype (76.4% of S4 were PP; P ¼ 9.4109). The S1, S2,
and S3 subtypes mostly matched the PI subtype, suggesting that the PI
subtype can be further split into three subgroups. Of these, S3 was the
most enriched with the PI subtype (85.7% of S3 tumors matched to PI;
P ¼ 1.71014; Fig. 1B). We also compared our expression subtypes
with the 6 LUAD-enriched mRNA expression clusters from the more
recent TCGA Pan-Lung study that used cluster-of-clusters analysis (4)
and found a high concordance across the two TCGA studies and our
analysis (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C; Supplementary
Table S2; Supplementary Note S1).
To explore the biological differences among our ﬁve subtypes, we
identiﬁed signiﬁcantly differentially expressed pathways across the
subtypes using single-sample GSVA on the MSigDB hallmark gene
sets (see Materials and Methods). S1 showed a low immune/inﬂam-
matory signature, and S2 showed high activity of gene sets associated
with epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell-adhesion.
Both S3 and S4 showed increased proliferation signatures (Q values
< 2.51010), but only S3 showed high immune/inﬂammatory sig-
natures (Q values < 3.71017). S5 distinctively showed low prolif-
eration signatures (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Table S3). In addition,
association of clinical parameters with our subtypes (Fig. 1C; Sup-
plementary Table S4–S5) showed that S5 tumors were more enriched
in older (>65) patients (Q ¼ 0.0022). Interestingly, Both S2 and S5
tumors were more enriched in never-smokers than S3 and S4 (Q <
0.012).
To further support partitioning the 60 tumors originally assigned to
the PI subtype into our S1–S3 subgroups, we found a consistent set
of differentially active pathways in each subgroup: low immune/
inﬂammatory signature in S1; high EMT in S2; high E2F, MYC targets,
G2–M markers, and interferon alpha/gamma response in S3, etc. These
ﬁndings demonstrate that the differences between the S1–S3 sub-
groups already existed in the original TCGA cohort but were likely
not detected due to the small sample size (Fig. 1C; Supplementary
Fig. S1D–S1F; Supplementary Table S3; Materials and Methods).
Altogether, we revealed novel, biologically distinct subtypes that were
previously grouped together within the single PI subtype.
To associate each of our ﬁve expression subtypes with driver events
(point mutations, indels, and copy-number alterations), we applied
MutSig2CV (25) and GISTIC 2.0 (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S2A
and S2B; Supplementary Table S6–S7; ref. 27). Consistent with
the original TCGA paper (2), S3 (mapping to PI-subgroup) was
enriched with comutation of TP53 and NF1; S4 (mapping to PP) was
enriched with activating KRAS mutations, inactivating STK11
mutations, and KEAP1 mutations; and S5 (mapping to TRU) was
enriched with EGFR mutations/ampliﬁcations (2). Interestingly, S2
(one of the subgroups of the PI subtype) was also enriched with EGFR
mutations/ampliﬁcations, even with a higher frequency than S5 (40%
vs. 17%, P ¼ 0.0023).
Beyond the previous associations of driver events, our new sub-
typing approach in a larger dataset enabled further identiﬁcation of
signiﬁcantly recurrent SMARCA4, ATM, FANCM, and PCDHGA6
mutations as well as ampliﬁcation of MET, FGFR1, and PIK3CA in S4;
and BRAF, SETD2, and CTNNB1 recurrent mutations in S5 (Fig. 1D;
Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Thus, our new subtypes show more
enriched mutations compared with the previously identiﬁed subtypes.
STK11 mutations, in particular, were enriched in KRAS-mutant S4
tumors (21 STK11-mutant tumors among 46 KRAS-mutant S4
tumors; Fisher exact test, P ¼ 0.0029), suggesting that S4 tumors
might be more resistant to PD-1 inhibitors (15, 29). Using a previously
reported IP AI assay that searches for TILs in hematoxylin and eosin
slides (Supplementary Table S8; ref. 28), S4 tumors also showed a trend
of lower inﬂamed scores and higher immune-excluded scores in
KRAS/STK11 comutated samples versus all other samples, whereas
non-S4 comutated samples showed no difference (Supplementary
Note S2).
Following this, we leveraged 16 previously calculated genomic
features for TCGA samples (30) to further explore differences across
the S1–S5 subtypes (Supplementary Fig. S3). S2 and S5 (both signif-
icantly enriched with EGFR mutations) have lower overall somatic
TMB than the other subtypes, including signiﬁcantly lower frequencies
of both nonsilent mutations and indels, which inﬂuence the number of
predicted neoantigens (Q < 0.0011; Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3D). In
features related to SCNAs, we observed that S1 and S4 have signif-
icantly higher number of copy-number segments and fraction of
genome altered by SCNAs; higher levels of homologous recombination
defects and aneuploidy score (Q < 0.0011; Supplementary Fig. S3E–
S3H); and relatively lower stromal fraction and intratumor heteroge-
neity (Supplementary Fig. S3I–S3J). These genomic differences pro-
vide orthogonal evidence for splitting the prior PI subtype into S1
(higher SCNAs) and S2 (lower TMB) subtypes, with the remaining
PI-like tumors falling into S3. Finally, we associated our subtypes with

immune cell populations deﬁned by Thorsson and colleagues (30)
using CIBERSORT (31) for deconvolving expression data (Supple-
mentary Fig. S4A). We found that S2 showed signiﬁcantly higher
TGFb levels and a higher fraction of M2 macrophages (Supplementary
Fig. S4B), which may be explained by secretion of TGFb by M2
macrophages to promote immune suppression in S2 (32). Collectively,
the genomic characterization of our ﬁve expression subtypes shows
that each subtype has distinct biology.
Next, we tested whether our expression subtypes associated with
clinical outcome. While the TRU expression subtype showed signif-
icantly longer overall survival compared with other subtypes (PP and
PI combined; P ¼ 0.023; log rank test) in the TCGA LUAD study (2),
this association was no longer signiﬁcant when age, gender, and tumor
stages were corrected for (Cox proportional hazard P ¼ 0.45; Sup-
plementary Table S9). On the other hand, S5 subtype enriched with
TRU subtype (Fig. 1B) showed signiﬁcantly longer overall survival
compared with other tumors (P ¼ 0.02; Supplementary Fig. S4C),
highlighting that S5 tumors have a stronger association with overall
survival.
Subtype-speciﬁc cancer vulnerabilities
We next leveraged the CCLE (16, 17) and DepMap (18) resources,
which collectively provide expression data as well as CRISPR and drug
screening data for 1,100 cell lines, to ﬁnd subtype-speciﬁc cancer
vulnerabilities. We ﬁrst probabilistically classiﬁed the 78 CCLE LUAD
cell lines into the LUAD expression subtypes using subtype-speciﬁc
marker genes (Figs. 1A, and 2A; Supplementary Table S10–S11;
Materials and Methods). Because only S3 and S4 were assigned a
sufﬁcient number of cell lines (30 and 16, respectively), we focused our
downstream analysis on these subtypes. To validate our subtype
classiﬁcation, we conﬁrmed that the S3- and S4-associated cell lines
harbored genetic events, somatic point mutations, and copy-number
alterations (Supplementary Figs. S5A and S5B) that were consistent
with patients associated with S3 and S4 tumors. Comparison of the
cancer vulnerabilities of 21 LUAD driver oncogenes between S3/S4
and the other CCLE LUAD cell lines (Fig. 2B) did not yield signiﬁcant
S3 vulnerabilities (Supplementary Table S12) but did identify two
signiﬁcant vulnerabilities for S4: CDK6 and the CDK6-cyclin D3
complex gene, CCND3 (Supplementary Table S12). This ﬁnding
suggests that S4 tumors may be dependent on the CDK6 pathway
and thus potentially vulnerable to CDK6 inhibition.
Although we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant CRISPR vulnerabilities asso-
ciated with S3, CDK4 was the nominally signiﬁcant top potential S3
vulnerability (P ¼ 0.014; Q ¼ 0.14; median CERES scores in S3 ¼ –0.68
and in the other cell lines –0.47; Supplementary Table S12), consistent
with the recurrent genomic alterations in CDK4 (Supplementary
Figs. S2B and S5B) in S3. We therefore functionally tested the sen-
sitivity of S3-associated cell lines to CDK4-speciﬁc inhibition using
two CDK4 inhibitors: palbociclib and CDK4/6 inhibitor IV (CINK4).
Both compounds are known CDK4/6 inhibitors at high concentra-
tions; however, at low concentrations, they are potent CDK4-only
inhibitors that induce G1 cell-cycle arrest and senescence in retino-
blastoma protein (Rb)-proﬁcient cell lines (33). We evaluated prolif-
eration in 9 cell lines treated with either palbociclib or CINK4
(four from the S3 subtype, three from the S4 subtype, and two that
were assigned to other subtypes; see details in Materials and Methods).
As expected, the S3 cell lines showed signiﬁcantly lower proliferation
(higher response) compared with the S4 and unassigned cell lines
[palbociclib: P ¼ 1.6105 and P ¼ 4.1.106 respectively [(Supple-
mentary Fig. S5C, left; Supplementary Table S13) and CINK4: P ¼
3.5103 and P ¼ 3.3103 (Supplementary Fig. S5C, middle;
Supplementary Table S13)]. These results show that the S3 subtype
depends on CDK4, suggesting that therapy that includes a CDK4
inhibitor may beneﬁt patients with S3 assigned tumors.
Because palbociclib inhibits both CDK4 and CDK6 at higher
concentrations, we could not test CDK6-only inhibition in S4 cell
lines, and higher doses of palbociclib inhibited proliferation in all cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S5C, right; Supplementary Table S13).

Taken all together, the CRISPR data and drug sensitivity experiments
demonstrate speciﬁc vulnerabilities related to CDK4 in S3 and CDK6/
CCND3 in S4 subtypes.
Proteogenomic analysis reveals distinct protein regulation
between S3 and S4
To further characterize the expression subtypes at the proteomics
level, we ﬁrst classiﬁed the CPTAC LUAD samples (5) to S1–S5 based
on the expression of subtype-speciﬁc marker genes (Figs. 1A and 3A;
Supplementary Tables S10 and S14). Because S3 (n ¼ 11), S4 (n ¼ 10),
and S5 (n ¼ 51) were the major subtypes represented in the CPTAC
LUAD cohort, we focused our downstream proteogenomic analysis on
these subtypes. Consistent with the TCGA data analysis, both S3 and
S4 showed increased proliferation signatures, and S3 also showed an
increased immune/inﬂammatory signature (Fig. 3A). Comparing our
expression subtypes with the CPTAC multiomics clusters (5), we
found a good agreement: S3 was enriched with CPTAC multiomics
cluster C1 tumors (PI enriched; 11/11), S4 was enriched with C3

tumors (PP enriched; 9 /10) (Supplementary Fig. S6A), and S5 was
enriched with C4 tumors (TRU enriched; 33/51). The multiomic
subtypes in CPTAC (5) also signiﬁcantly overlapped with TCGA
mRNA subtypes and provided additional evidence of a more reﬁned
partitioning of the PI subtype.
Next, we focused on the genomic and proteomic features of each of
our subtypes. The overall frequency proﬁles of ampliﬁcation or
deletion of signiﬁcantly copy-number altered genes was similar
between the TCGA and CPTAC cohorts for S3, S4, and S5 (cosine
similarities > 0.93; Fig. 3B). Because CPTAC and TCGA had different
ethnicity distributions (Supplementary Fig. S6B), we tested whether
differences are attributed to ethnicity. Among CPTAC samples,
only S5 had sufﬁcient numbers of Caucasian samples (n ¼ 18) for
statistical analysis. For S5, the cosine similarity was very similar
between all S5 tumors (0.974) and Caucasian-only S5 tumors
(0.970), suggesting that our subtype classiﬁcation was robust with
respect to ethnicity.
We next explored the effect of recurrent SCNAs on protein expres-
sion. Among the genes with recurrent SCNAs (in S3–S5, Supplemen-
tary Table S15), JAK2 and CD274 (PD-L1) showed both recurrent gene
ampliﬁcation and signiﬁcantly higher protein expression in S3 (Wil-
coxon rank sum test, Q < 2.9102, 4103, respectively; Fig. 3C;
Supplementary Fig. S6C). Interestingly, MET showed recurrent gene
ampliﬁcation in both S3 and S4, but its protein expression was
signiﬁcantly upregulated only in S3 (Q < 2103; Fig. 3C), also
exceeding the expression in control normal adjacent tissues (NAT;
Q < 5.5104; Supplementary Fig. S6D). Moreover, S3 tumor samples
with MET ampliﬁcation showed much higher MET protein expression
than S3 tumors with no MET ampliﬁcation (Q < 5103), whereas
other subtypes showed weaker (or no) correlation between MET
ampliﬁcation and MET protein expression. Of all the genes that
showed recurrent gene deletion in both S3 and S4, only FAT1 and
PDE4D also exhibited signiﬁcant changes to their proteomic expres-
sion. Moreover, only S3 exhibited signiﬁcantly downregulated protein
expression for both FAT1 and PDE4D that was associated with their
respective gene loss when compared with both NATs and the other
subtypes (Q < 6.3104, 3.6104, respectively). We observed a
similar trend for mRNA expression in the TCGA LUAD cohort.
These ﬁndings highlight the need to take into account not only
copy-number alterations but also mRNA and protein expression for
understanding downstream effects of genetic alterations (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S7A; ref. 34).
MET is a core regulator of proliferation and PD-L1 expression in
S3
Our initial pathway activation analysis found that both S3 and S4
upregulate proliferation-associated genes, whereas only S3 highly
expresses immune-related genes (Fig. 1C). To gain additional insight
into the underlying biological differences between S3 and S4, we
performed a deeper proteogenomic characterization of our subtypes.
We noted that CD274 (PD-L1) was among the two top markers that are
both recurrently ampliﬁed in S3 and strongly associated with S3
(marker-subtype association values ¼ 2.544 for SBSN gene to S3,
2.43 for CD274 gene to S3; Supplementary Table S7, Supplementary
Table S10). We further observed that PD-L1 copy number, mRNA
expression, protein expression, and phosphorylation levels were sig-
niﬁcantly higher in S3 versus S4 (Figs. 3B–C and 4A; Supplementary
Fig. S7B). Because both S3 and S4 showed high proliferation signatures
and recurrent MET ampliﬁcation (Fig. 1C; Figs. S2B and S7C), we
assessed MET copy-number and protein expression across subtypes
and found that MET copy number was signiﬁcantly higher in S3
versus S4, and that its expression of mRNA, protein, and phos-
phorylation levels was also higher in S3 versus S4 (Figs. 3B–C
and 4B), echoing the expression pattern of PD-L1. The mRNA and
protein expression of MET were also signiﬁcantly higher in S3
versus S4, even when restricting the analysis only to MET-ampliﬁed
tumors (Q ¼ 1.1108 for mRNA, Q ¼ 2.7102; Supplementary
Fig. S7D). In addition, we identiﬁed higher MET pathway activation
in S3 versus S4 as evidenced by increased phosphorylation levels of
GAB1 in S3, a known downstream substrate of MET (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S7E). On the basis of a previous study showing a negative
correlation between MET expression and the expression of T-cell
effector molecules (granzyme A, granzyme B, and perforin) in the
TCGA dataset (35), we asked whether the same pattern is present in
both subtypes. Interestingly, the expression of MET negatively
correlated with T-cell effector molecules in S3, but not in S4
(Fig. 4C), suggesting potential immune evasion of S3 tumors asso-
ciated with MET overexpression.
To characterize the proteogenomic differences by an alternative
approach, we evaluated proliferation and immune signatures using
previously developed scores for proliferation and lymphocyte
inﬁltration (30). Again, consistent with our results (Fig. 1C), we found
high proliferation scores in both S3 and S4, and a higher immune score
only in S3 (Fig. 4D). In addition, this alternative characterization
method showed that S3 had a signiﬁcantly higher fraction of antitu-
moral M1 macrophages (Q ¼ 3.77109; Wilcoxon rank sum test of
S3 vs. others), suggesting a favorable tumor immune microenviron-
ment for therapy, whereas S4 showed a signiﬁcantly higher fraction of
protumoral Th2 cells (Q ¼ 8.751023; Wilcoxon rank sum test of
S4 vs. others; SupplementaryFig. S4). We also observed increasedIFNg
pathway activity in S3 compared with S4 and S5 based on protein
expression and phosphorylation data (Q < 2.61012; Fig. 4E; Sup-
plementary Tables S16 and S17). This ﬁnding was further supported by
the increased expression of proteins involved in antigen presentation
and interferon signaling in S3 (Supplementary Fig. S8A). Based on a
previous report of IP by AI-powered spatial TIL analysis (Supple-
mentary Table S8; ref. 28), we categorized the samples in our subtypes
into 3 deﬁned IPs: inﬂamed, immune-excluded, and immune-desert
(Materials and Methods). S3 showed a higher proportion of the
inﬂamed IP than the immune-excluded IP (53.8% vs. 34.4%, Q ¼
0.047; Fig. 4F; Supplementary Fig. S8B; Supplementary Table S18).
Taken together, these proteogenomic ﬁndings support increased
immune/inﬂammatory activity in S3.
To further support and validate our proliferation ﬁndings in cell
lines, we explored the response of our subtype-speciﬁc cell lines
(described above) to the MET inhibitor, tivantinib. At 4 days post-
treatment with tivantinib, S3 cell lines showed a signiﬁcantly increased
proliferation (P > 0.001) under treatment compared with the other
assigned groups (data not shown), and in particular, compared with S4
(Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S19). Previous reports in NSCLC cells
suggested a direct relationship between PD-L1 and MET expression by
showing enhanced PD-L1 expression in response to c-MET inhibi-
tion (36). To test whether we could also observe this relationship in our
subtypes, we assessed PD-L1 levels by immunoﬂuorescence. A signif-
icant increase in PD-L1 levels was detected in all subtypes in response
to tivantinib (Wilcoxon test P value > 0.0001; Fig. 5B–C; Supplemen-
tary Table S20). Because c-MET inhibition drives PD-L1 expression by
suppressing glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3b; ref. 36), we next
tested the correlation of mRNA expression between MET and
GSK3b in LUAD cell line data and found a signiﬁcant positive
correlation only in the S3 subtype (Pearson correlation coefﬁcient ¼
0.46, P ¼ 0.016; Fig. 5D).

Collectively, these data suggest a model for S3 in which MET plays a
key role in driving proliferation through GAB1/AKT1, and MET can
also upregulate PD-L1 expression through the GSK3b axis, potentially
for immune escape. Additional synergistic players, found to have
higher protein expression in S3 versus S4, such as BCL2L1, PAK1,
and RB1, also likely further contribute to the proliferation of cells in S3
(Fig. 5E; Supplementary Fig. S8C). Hence, S3 tumors may respond to a
combined therapeutic regimen of MET and PD-L1 inhibitors.
S3 is a robust biomarker for ICB response
Lastly, we tested our hypothesis that S3 tumors are more responsive
to ICB due to high PD-L1 protein expression and an immune-inﬂamed
phenotype. We ﬁrst classiﬁed the independent SMC LUAD cohort
patients (n ¼ 164) treated with ICB to S1–S5 based on the expression of
the subtype-speciﬁc marker genes (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Tables S10
and S21–S25). Consistent with the TCGA data analysis, S2 showed
high activity of EMT and cell-adhesion signatures (Supplementary

Fig. S8D). Both S3 and S4 showed increased proliferation signatures,
and S3 showed an increased immune/inﬂammatory signature. PD-L1
protein expression by IHC was also signiﬁcantly higher in S3 com-
pared with other subtypes (P value ¼ 1.05106; Supplementary
Fig. S8E). After conﬁrming our subtypes in the SMC LUAD cohort, we
studied whether responders to ICB are enriched in any of the subtypes.
Interestingly, responders were enriched only in S3 (x2 test P ¼ 0.0004;
Fig. 5F). Even after correcting for age, gender, smoking status, and PD-
L1 expression, S3 was still signiﬁcantly associated with ICB response
(P ¼ 0.00045; Supplementary Table S25). S3 was also signiﬁcantly
associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS; P ¼ 0.0098; HR
¼ 0.61; Fig. 5G), and multivariate analysis showed that S3 (P ¼ 0.012;
HR ¼ 0.64) was more strongly associated with PFS than PD-L1
expression (P ¼ 0.59; HR ¼ 1.09; Supplementary Fig. S8F). These
results suggest that the S3 subtype can potentially be used as a robust
biomarker for predicting response to ICB in the clinic.
Biomarkers for identifying patients with S3 or S4 tumors
The above ﬁndings suggest that BayesNMF projection can be used
as a robust classiﬁer for subtyping analysis, but this type of analysis
requires the evaluation of 500 subtype marker genes. In the interest of
developing a more clinically useful approach, we tested whether a
fewer set of key genes could be used as biomarkers to reliably identify
tumors belonging to S3 and S4. Using the subtype marker genes
deﬁned above from gene-expression data (Supplementary Table S7)
as the potential features to test, the best prediction model for S3
(23 genes) had an accuracy of 95%, and the best prediction model for
S4 (27 genes) had an accuracy of 85% (Table 1; Supplementary
Table S26). To identify IHC markers, we also considered TCGA RPPA
data as potential proteomic features. The best prediction models
for S3 and S4 contained 20 and 24 protein features, respectively (both
91% accurate). In addition, for better clinical utility, we forced the
model to reduce the number of features down to ﬁve (Materials
and Methods). Interestingly, the ﬁve-feature model for S3 based on
RPPA data (PD-L1, JAK2, MIG6, P70S6K1, GATA6) still showed a
high model accuracy of 91%, whereas the ﬁve-feature model for S4
(BIM, CAVEOLIN1, FOXM1, PKCPANBETAII_pS660, NRF2) had a
reduced accuracy of 74%. Overall, these results show that we can reach
high prediction accuracies for S3 and S4 using both gene expression
and RPPA data.
Discussion
Over the past several years, multiple lung cancer subtype studies
have revealed important biological insights and clinical out-
comes (2, 3, 4, 5). While these studies were mostly consistent with
the PI, PP, and TRU subtypes deﬁned in the original TCGA study (2),
we were sufﬁciently powered in the current study to further partition
the PI subtype into 3 subgroups: S1, S2, and S3. By integrating genomic
and proteomic data, we further identiﬁed distinct biology in each of
our subtypes as well as subtype-speciﬁc recurrent mutations (point
mutations, indels, and SCNAs). Notably, the biology of these subtypes
was quite distinct from the biology of subtypes identiﬁed by the
CPTAC LUAD study (5) because the CPTAC LUAD subtypes were

based on multiomics data from a smaller sample size than ours
(>5-fold smaller, with only one S1 and no S2 tumors found in the
CPTAC LUAD cohort). Furthermore, the unique features of the newly
identiﬁed subtypes might also serve as biomarkers of response to
targeted therapies (e.g., response to EGFR inhibitors and TGFb
inhibitors for S2; response to PD-L1, MET, and CDK4 inhibitors for
S3; and resistance to PD-1 inhibitors for S4 due to STK11 mutations;
ref. 15; Table 2). An integrative analysis of TCGA and DepMap data
also demonstrated the proof-of-concept idea that leveraging the
genome-wide CRISPR screening data and expression subtypes of cell
lines can identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities for speciﬁc expres-
sion subtypes.
Our observation that MET ampliﬁcation had a profound impact
on its protein expression in S3 but not in the other subtypes suggests
that the mRNA and protein expression of these genes may, in some
cases, be affected by negative feedback loops or other types of
regulation that reduces the effect of the increased DNA copy
number. These results highlight the importance of integrating the
genomic and proteomic data to reveal underlying subtype-speciﬁc
biology (37, 38, 39, 40).
By leveraging proteogenomic data to explore the subtype-speciﬁc
effect of MET ampliﬁcation, we show that MET ampliﬁcation in S3
tumors may lead to cell proliferation through the GAB1/AKT1 axis. In
addition, the observed S3-speciﬁc positive correlation between MET
and PD-L1 expression suggests that the MET gene may regulate PD-L1
expression in S3 tumors through GSK3b, consistent with ﬁndings in
lung cancer cell lines (35). A recent study demonstrated that MET
protein ampliﬁcation attenuates immunotherapy response by inhibit-
ing STING in lung cancer and that targeted MET inhibition could
increase the efﬁcacy of immunotherapy (41). In our data, the MET–
STING axis was attenuated only in S4, but not in S3, suggesting that the
MET–GSK3b–PD-L1 axis may play a more important role in S3 than
the MET–STING axis. Thus, in S3, MET might be a core regulator of
two important cancer-related functions: (i) immune escape by upre-
gulating PD-L1 expression upon inhibition and (ii) proliferation
through a synergistic effect with increased expression of BCL2L1 and
MCM-family members (42, 43). Hence, it is possible that PD-L1
overexpression in response to MET inhibition causes a suppression
of antitumor immunity that may help to explain the poor performance
of the c-MET inhibitor tivantinib in a clinical trial (44); moreover, this
trial being performed on mixed tumor subtypes rather than on a
selected patient population makes it difﬁcult to interpret whether
tivantinib would show effectiveness speciﬁcally in patients with LUAD
belonging to a subset such as S3. On the basis of our experimental
results and the higher response to ICB in the S3 subtype (based on the
SMC LUAD cohort), combination therapy targeting MET and PD-L1
could be synergistic for S3 tumors, beneﬁting from both inhibiting
MET and avoiding the immune-suppression due to PD-L1 over-
expression. Moreover, because S3 tumors also have relatively high
TMB, IFNg gene expression signature, and a higher proportion of
inﬂamed versus immune-excluded phenotype, this S3 subtype, which
accounts for approximately 20% of all patients with LUAD (105/509
TCGA LUAD tumors), further supports the potential combination of
MET inhibitors and PD-L1 blockade therapy (45).
Because S3 cell lines also had CDK4 cancer vulnerability
and showed high response to CDK4 inhibitors (Supplementary
Fig. S5C), S3 tumors might also respond well to combined CDK4
inhibitors and PD-L1 blockade, consistent with the ﬁndings from
multiple mouse model studies on combined CDK4/6 inhibitors and
ICBs (46, 47). Therefore, dedicated preclinical studies should be
performed in tumor models representing the different tumor sub-
types. These ﬁndings raise a potential clinical therapeutic hypoth-
esis that membership in the S3 subtype can serve as a biomarker of
response to combination immunotherapy targeting CDK4 or MET
together with PD-L1 inhibitors. Because S4 tumors showed recur-
rent CCND3 ampliﬁcation, and S4-associated cell lines showed a
signiﬁcantly stronger dependency on CDK6 (Fig. 2B), future
studies speciﬁcally targeting CDK6 in S4 cell lines and patients
would also be of interest. S3 cell lines also showed a higher stem cell
signature compared with other cell lines, suggesting that S3 might
show more lineage plasticity than other subtypes (Supplementary
Note S3). However, this observation needs to be experimentally
validated in future studies.
Overall, our study demonstrates that a BayesNMF approach can
identify novel tumor expression subtypes, and that integrative
analysis of multimodal data can identify subtype-speciﬁc biology
and vulnerabilities. Consistent subtype biology could be also
observed in the heterogeneous (Korean never-smokers) real-world
patient data (SMC LUAD), which shows the robustness of classifying
patients into the subtypes and their biology. Generation of mouse
models representative of our LUAD expression subtypes would allow
in vivo experimental validation of drug response associated with each
subtype (46, 47, 48). Because expression subtypes can represent both
the tumor cells and their microenvironment—both of which can
contribute to treatment response or resistance—the expression
subtypes can potentially inform more subtype-speciﬁc clinical inter-
vention. Future studies, at the single-cell level, could decouple the
contribution of different cell types and potentially reveal new
subtype-speciﬁc biology as well as cell types and states associated
with clinical outcomes (47, 49, 50).
