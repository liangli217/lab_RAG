Methods that integrate molecular network information and 
tumor genome data could complement gene-based statistical 
tests to identify likely new cancer genes; but such approaches 
are challenging to validate at scale, and their predictive value 
remains unclear. We developed a robust statistic (NetSig) 
that integrates protein interaction networks with data from 
4,742 tumor exomes. NetSig can accurately classify known 
driver genes in 60% of tested tumor types and predicts 62 
new driver candidates. Using a quantitative experimental 
framework to determine in vivo tumorigenic potential in mice, 
we found that NetSig candidates induce tumors at rates that 
are comparable to those of known oncogenes and are ten-fold 
higher than those of random genes. By reanalyzing nine tumor-
inducing NetSig candidates in 242 patients with oncogene-
negative lung adenocarcinomas, we find that two (AKT2 and 
TFDP2) are significantly amplified. Our study presents a 
scalable integrated computational and experimental workflow 
to expand discovery from cancer genomes.
Cancers arise when somatic mutations, copy number alterations, 
or genomic fusion events of specific genes confer a selective 
advantage to the corresponding cell, thus promoting tumorigen­
esis. (Hereafter, we will refer to these genes as driver or cancer 
genes.) Identifying driver genes in tumors of individual patients 
provides key mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic insights. 
Therefore, a central aim of oncology is to provide a complete 
catalogue of genes underlying human cancers1–6.
Cancer genes can be identified in an unbiased manner from 
somatic mutations or copy number changes in genomic sequence 
data by using gene-based statistical tests such as MutSig, 
Oncodrive, GISTIC, and RAE7–10. These methods have identi­
fied many genes that are mutated or amplified at high frequencies 
(>20%) in tens of tumor types11. However, for many tumor types,

mutation and copy number rates render it challenging to con­
fidently pinpoint driver genes at intermediate (2–20%) or low 
(<2%) frequencies11. For this reason, a large number of biologi­
cally or clinically relevant driver genes do not meet established 
statistical cutoffs and remain to be discovered.
Many alternative methods highlight network modules (where 
genes are connected based on, for example, correlations in gene 
expression or protein interactions) that are significantly mutated 
in tumors12–18. These analyses have been valuable for illuminat­
ing the biological processes and pathways involved in cancers 
(reviewed in Creixall et al.19). However, evidence from network-
based approaches comes from aggregating weak genetic signals in 
a set of connected genes and not from mutation signal in any indi­
vidual gene. This means that no strong direct link can be made 
between specific genes in a mutated module and the cancer in 
question. Additionally, most network-based methods are evalu­
ated retrospectively through benchmarks, whereas experimental 
follow-up is limited to a few novel gene candidates. ‘Knowledge 
contamination’ of well-studied genes is thus a major problem that 
puts the effectiveness of network methods in question; it is impos­
sible to determine how much circularity and bias favors results 
that agree with more established or classic cancer networks.
We aimed to quantify the real predictive value of network-based 
approaches and to maximize their benefit for driver prediction 
by developing a statistic (NetSig) that combines cancer muta­
tion data and molecular network information. NetSig addresses 
the effects of knowledge contamination and is designed to be 
independent of gene-based statistical tests, so that it can comple­
ment these approaches in any tumor genome analysis pipeline. To 
test the predictive power of NetSig, we developed a large-scale, 
in vivo, quantitative experimental framework that enabled us to 
compare the tumorigenic potential of 23 genes with a significant 
NetSig score (FDR ≤ 0.1) to those of 25 known cancer genes and 
79 random genes in mouse experiments. Based on the network

be particularly relevant to lung adenocarcinoma. We reanalyzed 
copy number data derived from 660 patients with lung adenocar­
cinoma to discover higher rates of amplification of TFDP2 and 
AKT2 in patients without established genomic driver events com­
pared to patients with mutations and amplifications in known 
oncogenes. NetSig code is freely available in the Supplementary 
Software and at http://www.lagelab.org/resources, and the algo­

Results
Design and properties of the NetSig statistic
NetSig combines data from 4,742 tumor genomes spanning 21 
tumor types and InWeb_InBioMap (a human protein–protein 
interaction network)20,21 to calculate the mutation signal in a genes’ 
functional protein–protein interaction network. Since we specifi­
cally wanted to test the predictive power of mutations in a gene’s 
network, we excluded mutation information on the gene itself in 
the calculation of the NetSig statistic (see Online Methods).
To benchmark NetSig and to understand the effect of knowledge 
contamination on the statistic, we defined a set of very well estab­
lished ‘Cosmic classic’ cancer genes from the Cosmic database (http://
cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) and a nonoverlapping set of ‘recently 
emerging cancer genes’ from recent sequencing studies (see Online 
Methods; Supplementary Table 1). To test for cryptic confound­
ers, we also defined a set of random genes (see Online Methods; 
Supplementary Table 1). We confirmed that the Cosmic classic 
and recently emerging sets can be classified based on their NetSig 
score with area under the receiver operating characteristics curves 
(AUCs) of 0.86 and 0.75, respectively (Fig. 1a; adjusted P < 0.05 
for each of these AUCs using permuted networks; Supplementary 
Fig. 1). As expected, the random control genes fit the null hypoth­
esis and could not be distinguished from other genes represented in 
InWeb_InBioMap (Fig. 1a; AUC 0.49, P = 0.8). We further show 
that NetSig can accurately classify cancer genes in ~60% of the tumor 
types for which we have data (see Online Methods; Supplementary 
Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2), which illustrates the potential 
of our statistic to inform many different individual tumor types and 
also tumor types with relatively few samples.
The majority of genes scored by NetSig fit the null hypothesis 
and lie on the diagonal in a quantile–quantile plot, but there is an 
overall genomic inflation (λ = 1.29) of the significances assigned 
to genes (Supplementary Fig. 3). This could be due to knowl­
edge contamination, the inherent polygenic nature of cancers, 
or a combination of these two factors. To dissect this phenom­
enon, we removed the effect of well-studied cancer genes from 
our analysis (see Online Methods; Supplementary Note 2). The 
ability to predict Cosmic classic cancer genes is reduced from an 
AUC of 0.86 to 0.79, indicating some knowledge contamination 
of this set, but the effect on ‘recently emerging’ cancer genes is 
much less pronounced (from an AUC of 0.75 to 0.73) (Fig. 1b). 
Consistent with these observations, removing the effect of 
the Cosmic classic gene set reduces λ from 1.29 to 1.09 in the 
quantile–quantile plot, and it only changes slightly to 1.07 
when the impact of the recently emerging set is also removed 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Furthermore, running NetSig on random 
networks results in a noninflated quantile–quantile plot, as 
expected (Supplementary Fig. 3). We also show that NetSig 
adequately normalizes for the number of interactions a gene has 
at the protein level (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Together, these analyses reveal some knowledge contamination 
in the protein–protein interaction data of the Cosmic classic set, 
which leads to a considerably inflated AUC in the benchmark 
if it is not taken into consideration. Conversely, there is almost 
no knowledge contamination of genes from recent sequencing 
studies. This means that when predicting new cancer genes from 
existing cancer genomes, knowledge contamination should not 
confound the NetSig method when applied to protein–protein 
interaction data from InWeb_InBioMap.
Predicting NetSig candidates from tumor genomes
To test whether NetSig can predict new driver genes from existing 
cancer genome data, we calculated NetSig scores of all genes that 
had at least one high-confidence protein interaction in InWeb_
InBioMap. We calculated NetSig scores both using the pan-cancer 
cohort of 4,742 tumors and mutation data from each of the indi­
vidual 21 tumor types represented in ref. 11 (see Online Methods). 
We declared genes significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 
Q ≤ 0.1 using the pan-cancer data (Fig. 1c) and at Q ≤ 0.1 in each 
of the individual 21 tumor types.
The pooled set (named NetSig5000; Supplementary Table 2) 
contains all unique genes that were significant in the pan-
cancer analysis or in at least one of the 21 tumor types. NetSig5000 
comprises 62 genes, which we divided into groups based on their 
known connection to cancer. Groups 1 (n = 12) and 2 (n = 9) 
contain genes already known to be involved in cancers based on 
point mutations or gene fusion events, respectively. These groups 
serve as a positive control that NetSig can identify known can­
cer genes. Groups 3 (n = 24) and 4 (n = 13) contain genes that 
have been speculated to be causal in cancers based on evidence 
from model systems or from gene expression analyses. Group 5 
(n = 4) genes have never been linked to cancer (see Supplementary 
Table 3 and Supplementary Note 3 for more information about 
genes in the NetSig5000 set and Supplementary Fig. 5 for exam­
ples of NetSig networks). All results can be accessed and visual­
ized at http://www.lagelab.org/resources/.
Tumorigenic potential of NetSig candidates
To validate NetSig performance, we tested the tumorigenic poten­
tial of 23 genes from the NetSig5000 set (Supplementary Table 4; 
see Online Methods for selection criteria), 79 different patient-
derived mutations of 25 known driver genes (positive control; 
Supplementary Table 5), and 79 random genes (random control; 
Supplementary Table 6) using a massively parallel in vivo tum­
origenesis assay (Fig. 2a; see Online Methods). The assay trans­
duces and overexpresses barcoded cDNA constructs of candidate 
genes (and alleles representing patient-derived mutations) into 
activated small-airway epithelial cells (SALE-Y cells22) or acti­
vated immortalized kidney epithelial cells (HA1E-M cells22–25). 
For each cell model (SALE-Y or HA1E-M), all genes (or alleles) 
to be tested are pooled, grown, and injected subcutaneously into 
immunocompromised animals at three injection sites per animal. 
In animals that develop tumors, driver genes can be identified 
by homogenizing tumors in the animals and by sequencing the 
barcodes found in the tumor cells (see Online Methods).
To compare the tumorigenic potential of the three gene sets 
across multiple cell models, we developed a quantitative analytical

framework that defines a gene as tumorigenic based on both 
in vivo proliferation rate and the significance of relative tumor 
growth (see Online Methods; Supplementary Software). Our 
analysis showed that many of the tested NetSig5000 genes (11/23, 
or 48%) are indeed capable of driving tumorigenesis (Fig. 2b,c and 
Supplementary Table 7). Specifically, pooled screening supports 
the tumorigenic potential of AKT2, BLK, BMX, FER, FRK, MOS, 
PIK3CG, PTK6, RASGRP1, RASGRP3, and TFDP2 (for a com­
prehensive literature review of these genes, see Supplementary 
Note 4). In comparison, the proportion of known driver genes 
from the positive control set that induced tumors was 9/25, or 36%, 
providing an estimate of assay sensitivity (see Online Methods), 
and the proportion of random genes that induced tumors was 
4/79, or 5%, providing an estimate of the false positive rate 
(Fig. 2d). We note that the two random genes that induced tumors 
are NTRK1, which encodes a tyrosine kinase with established 
tumorigenic properties, and STRADA, an interactor of the STK11 
tumor suppressor at the protein level, which suggests that these 
could be real driver genes that remain to be discovered.
Reanalysis of lung adenocarcinomas
Nine NetSig5000 genes (AKT2, FER, FRK, MOS, PIK3CG, 
PTK6, RASGRP1, RASGRP3, and TFDP2) validated with high 
confidence in a cell model (SALE-Y) that is particularly relevant 
for exploring genes that can induce lung adenocarcinomas22. We 
hypothesized that a subset of these nine genes may be responsible 
for driving lung adenocarcinomas in oncogene-negative patients 
(meaning patients that do not have a known oncogenic driver 
event in the RAS/RAF/receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway 
as previously described26).
To test this hypothesis, we used a data set of 660 lung adeno­
carcinomas from TCGA and related studies26–28. We first tested 
for copy number differences between the oncogene-negative 
(n = 242) and oncogene-positive patients (n = 418), and we 
showed that the nine genes as a set have a significantly higher 
copy number in the former group (P = 7.0 × 10−3, Fisher’s exact 
test; Fig. 3a). Individually, TFDP2 and AKT2 are also found at 
higher copy numbers in the oncogene-negative group (FDR < 0.1 
for each gene, Fig. 3a).
Through an in-depth analysis of the surrounding genomic 
regions, we determined that adjacent potential oncogenes do not 
underlie the signal (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Note 5) and 
confirmed that there is no overall difference in copy numbers 
between the two patient groups (Supplementary Fig. 6). The 
genomic events observed for AKT2 and TFDP2 are not high-
level amplifications. Rather, 3% and 4% of the oncogene-negative

patients have two extra copies of AKT2 and TFDP2, respectively; 
and 4% and 14% have one extra copy of AKT2 and TFDP2, respec­
tively (Fig. 3d,e). We found no evidence for increased rates of 
gain-of-function somatic single-nucleotide variants (SSNVs) or 
insertions or deletions (indels) for the nine genes in the oncogene-
negative versus the oncogene-positive group.
Given the dominating effect of the RAS/RAF/RTK pathway in 
lung adenocarcinoma, a more straightforward approach to gene 
discovery would be to make a targeted analysis of mutations or 
copy number gains in genes in the extended RAS/RAF/RTK path­
way (defined here as genes that have at least one protein interaction 
with a RAS/RAF/RTK pathway member in InWeb_InBioMap). 
We compared the degree of copy number gains, and activating 
SSNVs/indels, in our set of nine genes to 100 matched sets of nine 
RAS-affiliated genes, which showed that the set of nine genes 
identified through our approach is significantly more enriched 
for oncogenic copy number gains (P = 0.04, using permutation 
tests; Supplementary Fig. 7). This analysis confirms that combin­
ing NetSig with tumorigenicity experiments is a better approach 
to identifying driver genes and events in lung adenocarcinomas 
than naively choosing genes in the extended RAS/RAF/RTK 
pathway.
To allow further exploration of pathway relationships relevant 
to lung adenocarcinomas, the NetSig networks of AKT2 and 
TFDP2 are plotted in Figure 3f,g.
Discussion
Our integrated computational and experimental analyses firmly 
establish that network-based approaches can contribute to 
expanding gene discovery from existing cancer genomes. Not only 
does the NetSig5000 set identify new genes in well-established 
oncogenic pathways (e.g., AKT2, PIK3CB, PIK3CG, RASGRP1, 
RASGRP3; Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8), 
but also our results point to new potential cancer pathways (e.g.,

TFDP2 and MYO7A; Supplementary Note 7, Supplementary 
Figs. 9 and 10, Supplementary Tables 8 and 9).
NetSig has a number of differences from other network-based 
methods (Supplementary Note 8, Supplementary Fig. 11, and 
Supplementary Table 10). An important feature is that it is explic­
itly designed to disregard any mutation information on the gene 
being tested, so that the signal comes from the gene’s network 
alone. This ensures that NetSig P values are fully independent of 
those from existing gene-based statistical tests such as MutSig, 
Oncodrive, GISTIC, and RAE. In fact, MutSig and NetSig P values 
for the same genes are only modestly correlated (Pearson correla­
tion coefficient = 0.05, data not shown). This design choice means 
that NetSig can be seamlessly combined with gene-based statisti­
cal tests in any computational cancer genome analysis workflow 
(Supplementary Note 9 and Supplementary Fig. 12).
NetSig is flexible and can work with many different types of 
functional genomics network data (Supplementary Note 9 and 
Supplementary Fig. 13). The average genomic inflation when 
NetSig is run on two different sets of transcriptional networks29 
(i.e., based on data that cannot be affected by knowledge con­
tamination) is 1.14 and 1.11 (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15). 
This is comparable to λ in the protein–protein interaction 
data when the effect of Cosmic classic genes is removed (1.09), 
which suggests that our approach to removing knowledge con­
tamination is efficient in canceling out that effect. This strongly 
suggests that the remaining inflation is due to polygenicity of 
cancers and not to any bias or confounders of the NetSig statistic 
or network data.
The study’s limitations, an estimate of how well the NetSig sta­
tistic predicts real cancer genes, and information on the benefit of 
including several cell models and genetic backgrounds in the valida­
tion workflow are discussed further in Supplementary Note 10.
While we did not observe evidence for gain-of-function SSNVs 
or indels across TFDP2 and AKT2, we expect that given more 
samples, these genes will be enriched for such events. This is 
consistent with the observation that NetSig5000 is enriched for 
genes with lower MutSig P values in Lawrence et al.11 (P = 0.04, 
two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). Together, our results 
strongly suggest that many genes in NetSig5000 are likely real 
intermediate- or low-frequency driver genes that will reach 
significance in gene-based statistical tests with more tumor 
genomes in the future.

ONLINE METHODS
Calculating the network mutation burden. For a given index 
gene, NetSig statistic is formalized into a probabilistic score that 
reflects the index-gene-specific composite mutation burden (i.e., 
the aggregate of single-gene MutSig suite Q values from Lawrence 
et al.11) across its first-order biological network and is calculated 
via a three-step process. First, we identify all genes it interacts 
with directly at the level of proteins, only including high-confi­
dence, quality-controlled data from the functional human network 
InWeb_InBioMap20,21,30 (where the vast majority of connections 
stem from direct physical interaction experiments at the level of 
proteins). Second, the composite mutation burden across members 
of the resulting network is quantified by aggregating single-gene 
MutSig suite Q values from Lawrence et al.11 into one value φ using 
an approach inspired by Fisher’s method for combining P values:
f ≈−
=∑
2
0
ln( )
qi
i
k
Where qi is the MutSig suite Q value for gene i, and k is the amount 
of genes in the first-order network of the index gene (i.e., the 
index gene’s degree). Third, by permuting the InWeb network 
using a node permutation scheme, we compare the aggregated 
burden of mutations φ to a random expectation. In this step, the 
degree of the index gene, as well as the degrees of all genes in the 
index gene’s network, is taken into careful consideration. The final 
NetSig score of an index gene is therefore an empirical P value 
that reflects the probability of observing a particular composite 
mutation burden across its first-order physical interaction part­
ners (at the level of proteins) normalized for the degree of the 
index gene as well as the degrees of all of its first-order interac­
tion partners. Because we are interested in estimating the muta­
tion burden independent of the index gene (so that the NetSig 
results are fully independent of gene-based statistical tests such as 
MutSig, Oncodrive, GISTIC, and RAE), this gene is not included 
in the analysis, and it does not affect the NetSig calculation. This 
also means that for any given gene, MutSig suite significances are 
independent of NetSig significances (i.e., the Cancer5000 gene set 
and the NetSig5000 gene set are independently predicted).
Classifying cancer genes. For each gene represented in InWeb_
InBioMap (12,507 or 67% of the estimated genes in the genome), 
we used the gene-specific NetSig probability to classify it as a 
cancer candidate gene or not. True-positive genes were a set of 
‘Cosmic classic’ genes and a set of ‘recently emerging cancer 
genes’. Specifically, the Cosmic classic set consists of 38 estab­
lished (or classic) cancer genes from the Catalogue of Somatic 
Mutations in Cancer (Cosmic, http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic; 
e.g., TP53, BRCA1, and BRAF; Supplementary Table 1). The 
‘recently emerging cancer genes’ contains 61 genes that have been 
recently identified as cancer genes from the Sanger Gene Census 
dataset (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census/; e.g., MLL2, CDK12, 
and GATA2; Supplementary Table 1). The gene set, for the pur­
poses of the benchmarking analysis, is a set of 87 random genes 
(Supplementary Table 1). True negatives were defined as all 
genes in InWeb that were not in these three sets; this is likely con­
servative, as many of these might be yet undetected cancer genes. 
We used the NetSig probability as the classifier and calculated 
the AUC for each gene set. For estimating AUC significances, 
we generated AUCs for 100 random networks (from Rossin 
et al.31) and calculated the empirical P value.
Using NetSig to classify driver genes across 21 tumor types. For 
each tumor type we calculated tumor-type-specific NetSig scores 
and classified the corresponding tumor-specific driver genes. For 
example, we assembled a set of driver genes from breast tumors 
(BRCA) by identifying genes significantly (FDR ≤0.1) mutated 
in this tumor type in Lawrence et al.11. We used mutation data 
from this tumor type to derive NetSigBRCA scores and measured 
their classification performance on the BRCA driver genes, which 
they could accurately distinguish with an AUC = 0.76. We com­
pared this result to the results using NetSig scores derived using 
the pan-cancer data set. The pan-cancer NetSig score increased 
our ability to accurately classify BRCA driver genes slightly to an 
AUC of 0.77 (for more information see Supplementary Note 1 
and Supplementary Fig. 2).
Testing the robustness of the NetSig approach. To test the 
robustness of the NetSig approach, we tried several alternative 
permutation methods and calculated the composite mutation bur­
dens of gene networks using both Q and P values from Lawrence 
et al.11. Specifically, to generate the null distribution of network 
mutation burdens used to assess the significance of observations 
in the actual data, we used both a node permutation scheme and 
a full network permutation scheme. Where the node permuta­
tion scheme permutes nodes that have similar degree has the 
advantage of being much faster than the network permutation 
scheme (explained in detail in Rossin et al.31), the architecture of 
the original network is more precisely mirrored in the random 
networks using the latter method. We ran the full analysis using 
both approaches and compared the quantile–quantile plots (data 
not shown) and classification of genes in Tiers 1–5. This analysis 
confirmed that the choice of permutation scheme does not have 
a major influence on the overall results (Supplementary Fig. 1). 
In addition to using Q values from Lawrence et al.11 for step 2 in 
the NetSig calculation (above), we also tried using unadjusted P 
values. For this latter approach the quantile–quantile plots (data 
not shown) as well as the classification of ‘Classic’ and ‘Recently 
emerging’ cancer genes are similar to the results we report in the 
main text (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Generating the NetSig5000 set. We used a node permutation 
scheme to create 106 permuted networks. NetSig probabilities were 
determined for every gene in InWeb that was covered by inter­
action data. The FDR Q values were calculated as described by 
Benjamini and Hochberg32 based on the nominal P values control­
led for 12,507 hypotheses. We performed NetSig analyses with the 
pan-cancer Q values as well as Q values from each of the 21 tumor 
types for which they were available. As it is a technical limitation 
of the NetSig approach that it is currently not possible to make 
5.5 × 106 network permutations, we could not create a data set where 
we correct for all 12,500 × 22 hypotheses tested in the NetSig5000 
set. For that reason our work does not have the equivalent of the 
Cancer5000-S (the stringent) set from Lawrence et al.11, where the 
authors control for all hypotheses is carried out simultaneously.
A multiplexed in vivo tumor formation screen in mice. We used 
the SALE-Y cell model previously described in Berger et al.22

and the HA1E-M cell model previously described in Kim et al.25. 
Specifically, our earlier work revealed that immortalized small-
airway epithelial cells harboring an activating YAP1 variant are 
rendered tumorigenic via activation of the EGFR/MAPK pathways 
(SALE-Y cells22), and immortalized kidney epithelial cells harbor­
ing an activating MAPK1 variant are rendered tumorigenic via 
activation of the PI3K/YAP/NFKB pathways (HA1E-M cells22–25). 
Briefly, we inserted each gene into barcoded cDNA clones, and 
these clones were transduced into SALE-Y and HA1E-M cells in 
96 well plates in arrayed format. The cells were selected with puro­
mycin, expanded, and pooled. 2 million cells per pool per site were 
injected subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice in three 
sites (interscapular area and left and right flanks) per mouse and 
tumor formation monitored. This protocol was approved under 
Broad Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocol 
ID: 0012-08-14-1. The experimental endpoint was reached when 
any tumor length exceeded 1 cm. Tumors were homogenized, 
and genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced to determine 
the relative proportion of each inserted DNA barcode. The rela­
tive proportions of each barcode serve as a proxy indicating the 
gene driving a tumor. To deal with data from deploying multiple 
cell models in parallel on a large set of positive controls, random 
controls, and NetSig candidates, we developed a new quantitative 
analytical framework (below).
Quantitative comparison of tumorigenicity. We measured the 
reproducibility and magnitude of the oncogenic signal of the indi­
vidual gene sets by developing and calculating two complemen­
tary metrics: maximum in vivo proliferation rate and significance 
of relative growth.
Calculating maximum proliferation rates. To determine a metric 
for growth doubling time of cells injected with NetSig5000 genes 
in the in vivo tumors, we calculated the proportion of reads in a 
tumor normalized to tumor volume and compared to the pro­
portion of reads in the preinjection cell pool, where volume for 
all pooled cells was set to 1 mm3 (which roughly corresponds 
to 2 million cells). This was done for all tumors, and for each 
tumor we divided the growth rate with the day the tumor was 
harvested to normalize for tumor age. This led to an estimate of 
the doubling time of the in vivo tumor growth for cells driven 
by overexpression of a particular NetSig candidate. We call this 
metric max proliferation rate per gene, which is plotted on the 
x-axis of Figure 2b.
Calculating the significance of relative growth. To calculate the 
significance of relative growth of cells in each cell type (SALE-Y 
and HA1E-M) transduced with a particular cDNA clone, we plot­
ted the distribution of relative reads in the tumors and compared 
to the preinjection value. Significances were calculated using a 
one sided t-test and reported as false discovery rates. We call this 
metric significance of proliferation rate and plotted the maxi­
mum significance (after iterative removal of dominant effects; 
see below) on the y-axis of Figure 2b.
Computational detection of dominant and subjugated oncogenic 
clones in tumors. When many oncogenic clones are pooled and 
injected into mice, a single clone often outcompetes other onco­
genic clones to dominate the tumor through a highly stochastic 
process. We refer to outcompeted, but real, oncogenic clones 
in the tumors as ‘subjugated oncogenic clones’. It is possible to 
detect subjugated oncogenic clones by iteratively removing domi­
nant clones from the cell pools and repeating the experiments. 
However, this is very labor intensive. We developed a computa­
tional approach where we iteratively removed genes that accounted 
for more than 50% of the reads in a tumor and repeated the sig­
nificance of relative growth analysis described above. In Figure 2b 
we report the best FDR after zero, one, or two iterations. We 
confirmed that the subjugated oncogenic clones detected com­
putationally were indeed driver clones by comparing the results 
from our computational approach to results from the iterative 
experimental removal of dominant clones and repetition of the 
injection of experimentally reduced cell pools into mice from 
Berger et al.22. This analysis showed that genes determined to 
be significant through our computational iterations also became 
dominant clones when other dominant clones were first removed 
from the experimental assay.
Sensitivity and specificity of tumorigenesis assay. Sensitivity. 
We determined how many of the 25 positive control genes were 
correctly classified as tumor inducing at z-scores of 1 and 2, in 
both the HA1E-M and SALE-Y model. In the HA1E-M model, six 
genes were classified as tumor inducing at a z-score of 1 and two 
genes at a z-score of 2 (see Supplementary Table 7 for details). 
As we tested a total of 25 genes, this gives a sensitivity of 6/25 
= 0.24 and 2/25 = 0.08, respectively (Fig. 2b). In the SALE-Y 
model, seven genes were classified as tumor inducing at a z-score 
of one and six at a z-score of two giving a sensitivity of 7/25 = 0.28 
and 6/25 = 0.24, respectively (Fig. 2b). When combining the two 
assays together, the sensitivity increases to 9/25 = 0.36, which is 
likely because we are testing the tumorigenic potential of genes 
across several genetic backgrounds. Analogous calculations can 
be seen for constructs in Supplementary Table 7.
Specificity. We determined how many of the random gene 
constructs were correctly classified as non-tumor-inducing at z-
scores of one or two (see above) in both the HA1E-M and SALE-Y 
models. In the HA1E-M model, three genes (STRADA, ZNF346, 
and DRD4) were classified as tumor inducing at a z-score of 1, 
and one gene (STRADA) was classified as tumor inducing at a 
z-score of 2. As we tested a total of 79 genes, this gives a specifi­
city of 76/79 = 0.96 and 78/79 = 0.99, respectively (Fig. 2b). In 
the HA1E-M model, one gene (NTRK1) was classified as tumor 
inducing at a z-score of 1 and z-score of 2. As we tested a total of 
79 genes, this gives a specificity of 78/79 = 0.99% at both thresh­
olds (Fig. 2b). Analogous calculations can be seen for constructs 
in Supplementary Table 7.
Choosing 25 genes for the validation experiment. We selected 
the genes based on a number of biological (not being known can­
cer genes) and technical (available high-quality reagents) criteria. 
First, we selected a set of genes that were either in group 3, 4, or 5 
of our literature curation groups (meaning they have not already 
been shown to be cancer genes in humans). Second, we chose the 
subset of genes for which there were already reagents (meaning 
open reading frame (ORF) constructs) available from the Genetic 
Perturbation Platform at the Broad Institute. Third, we chose the 
set of genes where the ORF constructs had been sequenced and 
(i) did not have any mutations (i.e., the sequence of the cDNA 
corresponded to the wild type and (ii) where the sequence of the 
ORF passed a high-quality-sequence cutoff to avoid testing ORFs 
where the sequence of the clone was ambiguous and could have

unknown mutations. Fourth, the cell models are optimized for 
perturbations in certain pathways (i.e., the SALE-Y cells are ren­
dered tumorigenic via activation of the EGFR/MAPK pathways, 
and the HA1E-M cells are rendered tumorigenic via activation of 
the PI3K/YAP/NFKB pathways). We hypothesized that choosing 
a set of genes that linked to the pathways activated in each cell 
model would likely increase the chance of inducing tumors in 
these models. We tested this hypothesis by choosing the 25 genes 
so, when possible, they interacted directly with members of the 
pathway activated in the HA1E-M model, but not in the SALE-Y 
model. However, we see similar validation rates in the two mod­
els, so it does not seem to have an effect that we are ‘fitting’ the 
candidates specifically to the HA1E-M model (Supplementary 
Note 10). It is likely that the higher validation rates observed 
for Netsig candidates (138% of the theoretical expectation; see 
“Discussion” in main text) when using both cell models in parallel 
are due to a combination of these selection criteria (available rea­
gents and connection to known cancer pathways in the HA1E-M 
model) and underestimates of the sensitivity of the assay because 
there is an upper limit to how many true positive oncogenes in a 
cell pool can induce tumors based on the issues with subjugated 
clones mentioned above.
Analysis of oncogene negative lung adenocarcinoma patients. 
Segmentation was performed using the Circular Binary 
Segmentation algorithm followed by Ziggurat Deconstruction to 
infer the length and amplitude of each segment. Recurrent peaks 
for focal somatic copy number alteration were identified using 
GISTIC 2.0 (ref. 8). A peak was considered to be focally ampli­
fied or deleted within a tumor if the GISTIC-2.0-estimated focal 
copy number ratio was greater than 0.1 or less than −0.1, respec­
tively. Purity and ploidy were estimated using ABSOLUTE33. 
Two peaks were considered the same across tumor types if (i) the 
known target gene of each peak was the same, or (ii) the genomic 
location of the peaks overlapped after adding 1 Mb to the start and 
end locations of each gene. For the second criterion, only peaks 
that contained fewer than 25 genes and were smaller than 10 Mb 
were considered (for more details see Campbell et al.26). Because 
we are executing a case-control analysis of the copy numbers of 
genes that induce tumors in the SALE-Y model relevant for lung 
adenocarcinoma, our analysis normalizes out any potential effects 
of, for example, gene size, amount of protein–protein interactions 
a gene has, and so forth.

Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life 
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list 
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. 
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research 
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist. 
`    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
Describe the statistical methods that were used to predetermine sample size OR if 
no sample-size calculation was performed, describe how sample sizes were chosen 
and provide a rationale for why these sample sizes are sufficient.
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
If no data were excluded from the analyses, state so OR if data were excluded, 
describe the exclusions and the rationale behind them, indicating whether exclusion 
criteria were pre-established. 
3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
For each experiment, note whether any attempts at replication failed OR state that 
all attempts at replication were successful.
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
Describe how samples were allocated to groups. If allocation was not random, 
describe how covariates were controlled. If this is not relevant to your study, explain 
why.
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
Describe the extent of blinding used during data acquisition and analysis. If blinding 
was not possible, describe why OR explain why blinding was not relevant to your 
study.
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.
6.   Statistical parameters 
For all figures and tables that use statistical methods, confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends (or in the 
Methods section if additional space is needed). 
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement (animals, litters, cultures, etc.)
A description of how samples were collected, noting whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same 
sample was measured repeatedly
A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated
The statistical test(s) used and whether they are one- or two-sided (note: only common tests should be described solely by name; more 
complex techniques should be described in the Methods section)
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as an adjustment for multiple comparisons
The test results (e.g. P values) given as exact values whenever possible and with confidence intervals noted
A clear description of statistics including central tendency (e.g. median, mean) and variation (e.g. standard deviation, interquartile range)
Clearly defined error bars
See the web collection on statistics for biologists for further resources and guidance.

`   Software
Policy information about availability of computer code
7. Software
Describe the software used to analyze the data in this 
study. 
See methods and SupplementaryMethodsAndData file
For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the paper but not yet described in the published literature, software must be made 
available to editors and reviewers upon request. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). Nature Methods guidance for 
providing algorithms and software for publication provides further information on this topic.
`   Materials and reagents
Policy information about availability of materials
8.   Materials availability
Indicate whether there are restrictions on availability of 
unique materials or if these materials are only available 
for distribution by a for-profit company.
Describe any restrictions on availability of unique materials used in the study OR 
confirm that all unique materials used are readily available from the authors or 
from standard commercial sources (and specify these sources) OR state that no 
unique materials were used.
9.   Antibodies
Describe the antibodies used and how they were validated 
for use in the system under study (i.e. assay and species).
For all antibodies, as applicable, provide supplier name, catalog number, clone 
name, and lot number. Also describe the validation of each primary antibody for the 
species and application, noting any validation statements on the manufacturer’s 
website, relevant citations, antibody profiles in online databases, or data provided 
in the manuscript OR state that no antibodies were used.
10. Eukaryotic cell lines
a.  State the source of each eukaryotic cell line used.
Provide information on cell line source(s) OR state that no eukaryotic cell lines were 
used.
b.  Describe the method of cell line authentication used.
Describe the authentication procedures for each cell line used OR declare that none 
of the cell lines used have been authenticated OR state that no eukaryotic cell lines 
were used.
c.  Report whether the cell lines were tested for 
mycoplasma contamination.
Confirm that all cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination OR 
describe the results of the testing for mycoplasma contamination OR declare that 
the cell lines were not tested for mycoplasma contamination OR state that no 
eukaryotic cell lines were used.
d.  If any of the cell lines used are listed in the database 
of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by 
ICLAC, provide a scientific rationale for their use.
Provide a rationale for the use of commonly misidentified cell lines OR state that no 
commonly misidentified cell lines were used.
`    Animals and human research participants
Policy information about studies involving animals; when reporting animal research, follow the ARRIVE guidelines
11. Description of research animals
Provide details on animals and/or animal-derived 
materials used in the study.
For laboratory animals, report species, strain, sex and age OR for animals observed 
in or captured from the field, report species, sex and age where possible OR state 
that no animals were used.
Policy information about studies involving human research participants
12. Description of human research participants
Describe the covariate-relevant population 
characteristics of the human research participants.
Provide all relevant information on human research participants, such as age, 
gender, genotypic information, past and current diagnosis and treatment 
categories, etc. OR state that the study did not involve human research 
participants.
