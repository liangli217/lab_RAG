Barrett’s esophagus, the intestinalization of the lower esophagus, devel­
ops in response to chronic gastric reflux and is the precursor to EAC1–3. 
Whereas Barrett’s esophagus is estimated to exist in at least 1:100 adults4, 
relatively few progress to cancer. Those that do develop cancer are typi­
cally diagnosed at an advanced, incurable stage. Therefore, there is 
substantial interest in defining the mole­cular and genomic features of 
aggressive Barrett’s esophagus to enable means to prevent cancer or 
identify disease when it is most curable. The transformation of Barrett’s 
esophagus into EAC follows the progressive development of increasing 
grades of dysplasia, leading to invasive carcinoma. Several studies have 
characterized differences between Barrett’s esophagus, dysplasia and 
EAC, looking at genomic copy number5–8 and focused analysis of specific 
cancer-associated genes5,9–12. Through studies of Barrett’s esophagus, a 
linear model of progression has emerged in which early, non-dysplastic 
Barrett’s esophagus represents a clonal or polyclonal expansion, typically 
following inactivation of the tumor suppressor CDKN2A5,7–10. Further 
subclonal expansions are thought to occur, often leading to the emer­
gence of a dysplastic clone with TP53 inactivation and other somatic 
alterations, including frequent genome doubling and increasing genomic 
disruption, resulting in malignant transformation7,9. We sought to 
further clarify the process underlying the transformation of Barrett’s 
esophagus into EAC by performing genomic analysis on Barrett’s 
esophagus and EAC samples derived from the same patient. We then 
extend this analysis to a cohort of previously sequenced EAC samples.
RESULTS
Paired Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma 
analysis
We first performed whole-exome sequencing on 25 patient-matched 
‘trios’, including fresh-frozen EAC, Barrett’s esophagus and non-
malignant, distant gastric or esophageal squamous tissue as a germline 
comparator (Supplementary Table 1). All samples were obtained by 
surgical resection from patients without previous chemo- or radiother­
apy, with Barrett’s esophagus intentionally isolated from a region not 
immediately adjacent to the tumor (when possible) during processing 
to avoid contamination of the Barrett’s esophagus sample with EAC 
cells. Upon pathological review, 14 Barrett’s esophagus samples con­
tained no dysplasia and 11 of the Barrett’s esophagus samples showed 
evidence of dysplasia. Of the 11 dysplastic samples, 6 contained 
changes consistent with high-grade dysplasia (HGD). After somatic 
mutation calling (Supplementary Data Set 1), we inferred the degree 
of shared ancestry for the paired Barrett’s esophagus and EAC samples

Barrett’s esophagus is thought to progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) through a stepwise progression with loss of 
CDKN2A followed by TP53 inactivation and aneuploidy. Here we present whole-exome sequencing from 25 pairs of EAC and 
Barrett’s esophagus and from 5 patients whose Barrett’s esophagus and tumor were extensively sampled. Our analysis showed that 
oncogene amplification typically occurred as a late event and that TP53 mutations often occurred early in Barrett’s esophagus 
progression, including in non-dysplastic epithelium. Reanalysis of additional EAC exome data showed that the majority (62.5%) of 
EACs emerged following genome doubling and that tumors with genomic doubling had different patterns of genomic alterations, 
with more frequent oncogenic amplification and less frequent inactivation of tumor suppressors, including CDKN2A. These data 
suggest that many EACs emerge not through the gradual accumulation of tumor-suppressor alterations but rather through a more 
direct path whereby a TP53-mutant cell undergoes genome doubling, followed by the acquisition of oncogenic amplifications.

on the basis of the number of shared mutations. In 11 of the 25 trios, 
the specific region of sequenced Barrett’s esophagus appeared to be 
clonally unrelated to the sampled tumor, as the samples lacked shared 
somatic mutations (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 
Set 2). In addition, hierarchical clustering of the paired samples using 
somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) failed to group these unre­
lated sample pairs together (Supplementary Fig. 2). In the remaining 
14 trios, the sampled regions of Barrett’s esophagus and EAC showed 
evidence of having emerged from a common neoplastic clone, as 
they shared 3.4–64% of the coding point mutations with a cancer cell 
fraction (CCF) of 1 (i.e., mutations present in all neoplastic cells in the 
tissue sample). Overall, we found no association between the presence 
of dysplasia and whether the Barrett’s esophagus and EAC samples 
were clonally related (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.69). Among the six 
samples with HGD, five were clonally related to the EAC (P = 0.18).
Our Initial analyses compared the degree of genomic disruption 
for the Barrett’s esophagus and EAC samples. The somatic mutation 
frequencies for Barrett’s esophagus ranged from 1.3 to 5.4 mutations/
Mb—demonstrating that even non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus has 
mutation frequencies higher than those of many common invasive 
cancers (Fig. 1a). Mutational densities increased from non-dysplastic 
Barrett’s esophagus (2.8 mutations/Mb) to dysplastic Barrett’s esopha­
gus (4.9 mutations/Mb; Student’s t test, P = 0.05) but were similar for 
dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus and EAC (4.1 mutations/Mb; P = 0.43). 
We also evaluated the base context of mutations in Barrett’s esophagus 
to query the presence of the common pattern of A>C transversions 
at the 3′ adenine of AA dinucleotides that we described in EAC13. 
The predilection for these transversions was also present in Barrett’s 
esophagus (Fig. 1b), suggesting that these mutations occur early 
during neoplastic progression, possibly as a result of exposure to 
bile and acid reflux. In the 14 clonally related cases, we separately 
analyzed the mutation spectra of the early shared mutations in 
comparison to the spectra for mutations that were private to either 
the Barrett’s esophagus or EAC sample. Although there was a trend 
for increased A>C mutations private to Barrett’s esophagus, this 
was not statistically significant (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Our analysis of structural genomic changes showed that, in con­
trast to point mutations, structural genomic disruption occurred at 
higher levels with progression to cancer. The mean number of focal 
deletions per sample increased steadily between non-dysplastic 
Barrett’s esophagus (10.43), dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus (20.73) and 
the paired EAC (40.20; P < 0.01 for both transitions) (Fig. 1c). The 
number of amplifications was strongly associated with progression 
from dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus to EAC (Fig. 1d). Non-dysplastic 
and dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus averaged 0.42 and 0.91 amplifica­
tions per sample, respectively, whereas EACs averaged 8.44 amplifi­
cations per sample (P < 0.001 for non-dysplastic BE versus EAC and 
dysplastic BE versus EAC), suggesting that amplifications might be 
key mediators of oncogenic transformation. Even between Barrett’s 
esophagus with HGD and EAC we still found a significant increase 
in the number of amplifications (P = 0.009; Supplementary Fig. 4). 
When we lowered the amplification threshold to include lower-level 
gains, the significant increase in amplification number with progres­
sion persisted (Supplementary Fig. 5).
We evaluated specific oncogenic alterations within the trios, starting 
with tumor-suppressor gene (TSG) alterations (Supplementary Table 2 
and Supplementary Data Set 1). Of the 11 Barrett’s esophagus sam­
ples clonally unrelated to the paired EAC sample, only one harbored 
a TP53 mutation (Fig. 2a). Although four of these Barrett’s esopha­
gus cases possessed a homozygous CDKN2A deletion, the EACs that 
emerged in these patients lacked detectable somatic CDKN2A altera­
tions. When we next evaluated the clonally related cases, we found 
that three of the four most distantly related trios (sharing 3.4%, 4.5% 
and 7.8% of mutations) had TP53 mutations shared by the Barrett’s 
esophagus and EAC samples (Fig. 2a,b), indicating that these TP53 
mutations were among the earliest somatic mutations in the devel­
opment of the tumors. All three of these tumors with early shared 
TP53 mutations were determined to have undergone whole-genomic 
doubling (WGD) using the ABSOLUTE algorithm14.
Furthermore, in these patients with evidence for an early TP53 
mutation, shared CDKN2A somatic alterations were not observed.

mutations in TP53 but not CDKN2A, which was either unaltered 
or had distinct inactivating events in the Barrett’s esophagus and 
EAC samples, suggesting that TP53 mutation was not preceded by 
CDKN2A inactivation in these cases (Fig. 2a,c). Only 2 of the 14 
related cases appeared to clearly follow the classic model in which 
the Barrett’s esophagus and EAC samples shared a CDKN2A altera­
tion but not a TP53 alteration, indicating that CDKN2A inactivation 
occurred before inactivation of TP53. These results suggest that TP53 
mutations may be an earlier event in Barrett’s esophagus pathogenesis 
in relation to other genomic alterations than previously recognized, 
often preceding (or occurring without) CDKN2A inactivation.
In contrast to the prevalent TSG alterations in Barrett’s esophagus, 
oncogenic activation events were far less prevalent in the sampled 
Barrett’s esophagus lesions (Fig. 3), even in samples with advanced 
dysplasia or where the sampled Barrett’s esophagus appeared to be 
closely related to the cancer (Supplementary Fig. 6). High-level 
amplifications of genes encoding oncogenic cell signaling proteins, 
cell cycle modulators and transcription factors were recurrently 
present in EACs but more infrequent in Barrett’s esophagus (Fig. 3 
and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). In addition, activating mutations 
of oncogenes were uncommon in Barrett’s esophagus, with only one 
known activating mutation identified, a PIK3CA mutation encoding 
p.Glu545Gln (Supplementary Data Set 1), which was shared with 
the paired EAC. Oncogenic mutations in the 25 EACs were also 
uncommon, with 1 CTNNB1 and 2 PIK3CA hotspot mutations 
identified (Fig. 3). Together, oncogenes encoding cell signaling proteins 
(64% versus 12%; P = 0.0003), cell cycle modulators (40% versus 8%; 
P = 0.0181) and transcription factors (64% versus 20%; P = 0.0037) 
were much more likely to have an activating event in the EAC than 
the paired Barrett’s esophagus, respectively. These data suggest that, 
although Barrett’s esophagus harbors common TSG inactivation, 
oncogene activation is a late step and may mediate transformation to 
cancer. In the patient sample (63) available for confirmatory testing, 
FISH analysis for ERBB2 confirmed our sequencing analysis, showing 
high-level amplification in the EAC sample and no amplification in 
the Barrett’s esophagus tissue (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Expanded multi-sample analysis via laser-capture microdissection
To better understand the progression of Barrett’s esophagus to EAC, 
we identified five additional patients (Supplementary Table 3) with 
a broad field of Barrett’s esophagus who underwent surgical esophagec­
tomies (without neoadjuvant therapy), from which we obtained 
paraffin-embedded samples representing multiple distinct stages of 
Barrett’s esophagus and EAC. We used laser-capture microdissection to 
isolate normal tissue and pathological samples spanning non-dysplastic 
Barrett’s esophagus, Barrett’s esophagus with low-grade dysplasia 
(LGD), Barrett’s esophagus with HGD, EAC and nodal metastatic foci. 
The number of neoplastic samples characterized per patient ranged 
from 5 to 11 (Figs. 4 and 5). Laser-capture microdissection allowed 
us to sample regions of Barrett’s esophagus in closer proximity to the 
tumor than was feasible with the earlier trios from fresh tissue. With 
DNA from these newly dissected samples, we performed whole-exome 
sequencing and processed the data to identify SCNAs, mutations and 
genomic doubling events (Supplementary Fig. 9). We then con­
structed phylogenetic trees indicating the evolutionary relationships 
between the subclones detected in each sample (Figs. 4 and 5, and 
Supplementary Figs. 10–13). In three of the five cases, all of the identi­
fied Barrett’s esophagus regions (both non-dysplastic and dysplastic) 
were clonally related to the EAC (Fig. 4). In the other two cases, all 
sampled regions of non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus were clonally 
unrelated to the EAC, but we identified dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus 
samples related to the sampled tumor (Fig. 5). Most individually dis­
sected tissue samples were sufficiently diverged from one another that 
no sharing of minor subclones occurred (mutations with CCF <1 in 
two or more samples). However, patients P3 and P7 appeared to con­
tain samples with partially overlapping subclones (Figs. 4f and 5b).
Barrett’s esophagus samples from two of the five esophagectomy 
cases supported our earlier observations that TP53 mutations might

occur earlier than previously thought in Barrett’s esophagus patho­
genesis. In patients P1 and P7 (Fig. 4b,f), TP53 missense mutations 
were shared by all sampled tissues, including regions of non-dysplastic 
Barrett’s esophagus (Supplementary Fig. 14). Furthermore, these two 
patients also demonstrated how oncogene amplification can be a late 
event mediating transformation. In patient P1, we identified a focal 
CDK6 amplification present in the two EAC samples but not in the 
Barrett’s esophagus or HGD samples. However, in the TP53-mutant 
regions of non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus and HGD, we detected 
a GATA6 amplification that was absent from the tumor (Fig. 4b), 
demonstrating that amplifications are not exclusive to EAC. In patient 
P7, we identified a high-level KRAS amplification in the tumor 
and in a focus of HGD immediately adjacent to the cancer (HGD1; 
Fig. 4f). The KRAS amplification was notably absent from other 
regions of LGD and HGD more distant to the tumor (LGD1 and 
HGD2). FISH analysis for KRAS confirmed these findings, with high-
level amplification (>25 copies) present in the EAC and amplification 
absent in HGD2 and LGD1 (Supplementary Fig. 15).
Individually dissected samples from patient P7 also demonstrated 
substantial overlap of distinct subclonal populations. Sample LGD1 
contained a major subpopulation (subclone 1a; CCF = 0.80–0.85) that 
was closely related to the last common ancestor of all neoplastic cells 
sampled in the patient. In addition, sample LGD1 contained a minor 
subpopulation (subclone 1b; CCF = 0.15–0.2) defined by 12 additional 
mutations, as well as single-copy loss of chromosomes 5q, 11p and 
13 and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 
7 and 21 (Supplementary Figs. 9–12). Subclone 1c was descended 
from a cell closely resembling subclone 1b, with ten additional 
mutations; subclone 1c was sampled only in HGD2. Subclone 1c 
closely resembled the common ancestor of all the subclones sampled 
in MET1, HGD1, EAC2 and EAC1 (none of which contained 
shared minor subclones with CCF <1). Sample BE1 contained two 
major subpopulations (subclone 2a (CCF = 0.4–0.6) and subclone 2b 
(CCF = 0.5–0.6)). Subclone 2a was descended from a subclone 
closely resembling subclone 1a, defined by seven additional muta­
tions. Subclone 2b was descended from a cell closely resembling 
subclone 2a, defined by 23 additional mutations (including an AKT1 
mutation encoding p.Gly10Val) and gains of chromosomes 10 and 
18p (Supplementary Figs. 9–12). We redrew the phylogenetic tree 
to represent the relationships between all subclones identified and 
overlaid the tissue samples onto the tree (Fig. 4f).
Patient P4 (Fig. 4c,d) exemplified a scenario where a CDKN2A 
deletion was present in all sampled regions of Barrett’s esophagus 
and EAC. We therefore inferred that a CDKN2A-null progenitor 
gave rise to five distinct non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus sub­
clones and one focus of LGD, all lacking TP53 alteration. However, 
we identified another subclonal branch in this case, consisting of 
five HGD and EAC samples all containing a TP53 mutation (encod­
ing p.Arg175His), focal low-level (two extra copies) amplification of 
MET and genomic doubling, consistent with a cancer in which TP53 
mutation occurred later in clonal evolution, following CDKN2A 
inactivation. Moreover, this case also supports the potential for 
oncogenic amplification to mediate transformation, as the one EAC 
sample harbored amplifications at CCNE1, GATA6, AKT2 and 3q26 
that were absent from all other samples. Samples HGD1, HGD2 and 
HGD3 all harbored a 7-Mb gain with approximately three extra cop­
ies compared to a 4N baseline on 17q, including ERBB2, which was 
not present in the EAC.

A rt i c l e s
Analysis of tissue from patients P3 and P6 
(Fig. 5) demonstrated the potential for het­
erogeneity within the field of both Barrett’s 
esophagus and EAC. The case for patient P3 
contained three separate neoplastic regions, 
each clonally unrelated to the others. A first 
region contained an area of non-dysplastic 
Barrett’s esophagus with a focal CDKN2A 
deletion. From this region, a segment of 
LGD emerged with biallelic loss of ARID1A. 
Separate from this region of Barrett’s esopha­
gus were two clonally unrelated primary 
cancers (Supplementary Fig. 16). The sample EAC1 contained a 
mix of two distinct populations. Subclone 1 harbored 182 unique 
mutations (including in SMARCA4) and additional copy number 
alterations, including a CCND1 amplification. EAC1 also contained 
a subpopulation of cells (subclone 2) that closely resembled the 
common ancestor of all subclones in the samples of more advanced 
disease—HGD1, EAC2 and MET1—with 125 mutations unique 
to this branch and unrelated to subclone 1. HGD1, EAC2 and MET1 
also underwent WGD, which was not evident in EAC1–subclone 1. 
Our focused analysis of this branch of advanced neoplastic tis­
sues demonstrated how oncogene amplification can lead to trans­
formation. The HGD sample contained low-level segmental gains 
on chromosomes 6, 7, 8 and 17. The EAC and metastasis samples 
possessed additional amplifications, often occurring on top of 
the gains in the HGD sample. EAC2 harbored a more focal MYC 
(chromosome 8) amplification and focal amplifications of 3q26 and MET 
(chromosome 7) not identified in the HGD region. In addition, MET1 
(from a local lymph node) had increased ERBB2 (chromosome 17) 
amplification, demonstrating further heterogeneity.
Our analysis of patient P6 identified one region of clonally distinct 
non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus as well as two EAC foci and two HGD 
regions, which all emerged with WGD and a shared ATM nonsense 
mutation. Interestingly, a focal CDKN2A deletion was present in one of 
the dysplastic samples (HGD1) but not in the HGD2 or EAC sample—
another demonstration of late CDKN2A inactivation. The two EAC 
samples shared a MET amplification not present in the dysplastic tissue.
Wider analysis of esophageal adenocarcinoma exomes
To validate our findings and better estimate the fraction of EAC cases

whole-exome sequencing data from 144 microsatellite-stable EACs 
that we recently presented13,15. Consistent with the conventional 
progression model, these tumors showed marked aneuploidy15 and 
harbored TP53 mutations in 97 of 144 (67%) cases. However, we iden­
tified CDKN2A inactivation via mutation or homozygous deletion in 
only 39 of 144 (27%) tumors14.
We reanalyzed the EAC whole-exome sequencing profiles using 
ABSOLUTE14 to make WGD calls and to determine whether spe­
cific mutations likely occurred before or after doubling. The majority 
(62.5%) of EACs showed evidence of WGD, corroborating previous 
findings14. Although tumors with and without WGD showed dif­
ferent ploidy and genomic disruption, mutation densities were not 
different between these two groups (Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18). 
TP53 mutations were distributed evenly across EACs with (67% 
TP53 mutant) and without (69% TP53 mutant) WGD. Within the 
WGD samples, 54 of 60 (90%) TP53 mutations were determined to 
have occurred before doubling. We compared the timing of TP53 
mutations with that inferred for other mutations of TSGs, including 
CDKN2A. TP53 was the only gene whose mutations were statisti­
cally more likely to have occurred before doubling (P = 8.7 × 10−7; 
Supplementary Fig. 19 and Supplementary Table 4), suggesting a 
role for TP53 as an antecedent to genomic doubling16,17.
We next searched for genomic characteristics that differentiate 
EACs with and without WGD, finding early evidence for a different 
spectrum of TSG alterations. CDKN2A and SMAD4 mutations were 
found in only 8% and 1% of EACs with WGD, respectively, but were 
present in 19% (P = 0.065) and 20% (P = 0.0001) of tumors without 
WGD (Fig. 6a). Broadening our TSG analysis, we found that TSG 
losses involving chromatin modification (P = 0.005), the cell cycle 
(P = 0.027) and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway 
(P = 0.0001) were all more frequent in the EACs without WGD (Fig. 6b 
and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Although we found that the 
mean number of deleted segments was not statistically differ­
ent between tumors with and without WGD (29.13 versus 30.93, 
respectively; P = 0.28), there was a trend for increased numbers of 
homozygous deletions in the samples without WGD (1.46 for 
samples without WGD versus 0.867 for samples with WGD; P = 0.104; 
Supplementary Fig. 20), as previously observed in serous ovarian 
cancer14. The observation that tumors that emerge from WGD have 
fewer somatic alterations of TSGs suggested that different alterations 
might drive transformation in these cases.
Therefore, we next evaluated patterns of oncogene activation, 
finding that the proportion of alterations predicted to activate onco­
genic signaling molecules, including KRAS, receptor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, did not 
differ between the groups with and without WGD (64% versus 54%, 
P = 0.22 for KRAS and RTKs; 9% versus 13%, P = 0.57 for PIK3CA) 
(Fig. 7). However, tumors with WGD showed more frequent amplifi­
cation of oncogenic transcription factors (43% versus 22%, P = 0.012) 
and a trend toward higher rates of amplification of cell cycle mediators 
(40% versus 24%, P = 0.069). More frequent CCNE1 amplifications 
in genome-doubled EACs (16% versus 6%) paralleled recent analyses 
across tumor types, which identified correlations between CCNE1 
amplification and WGD18,19. These findings indicate that the absence 
or presence of WGD in Barrett’s esophagus modifies the most likely 
pathway available to undergo transformation to cancer.
DISCUSSION
When the results of the EAC reanalysis are interpreted jointly with our 
earlier data on genomic analysis of paired Barrett’s esophagus–EAC 
cases, the results lead us to refine the previous model of the emer­
gence of EAC from Barrett’s esophagus. EAC has been thought to arise 
from the progressive accumulation of genomic alterations, starting 
with ones in CDKN2A and followed by expansion of a TP53-mutant 
dysplastic clone that is able to develop tetraploidy and genomic 
instability7,20. Consistent with this idea, we confirm that Barrett’s 
esophagus harbors frequent TSG alterations, even in Barrett’s esopha­
gus segments clonally unrelated to the cancer, corroborating reports

of TSG inactivation in non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus21 and clonal

that underscore the importance of TP53 mutation in the neoplastic 
progression of Barrett’s esophagus23. However, our results also sug­
gest that, in many cases, TP53 mutations occur earlier in the disease 
process relative to other alterations (including loss of CDKN2A) 
and can be detected in the non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus of 
cases that progress to cancer. In addition, our data suggest that onco­
gene activation via amplification may often be a critical later event

A rt i c l e s
contrast to that seen in pancreatic or colorectal cancer, where onco­
gene activation via mutation is believed to occur earlier, typically 
before TP53 inactivation24–27.
Our data therefore suggest that the traditional Barrett’s esophagus 
progression model conflates two general pathways for oncogenic trans­
formation (Fig. 8). One pathway, starting similarly to the traditional 
model, appears to involve the progressive accumulation of TSG losses 
(commonly CDKN2A and TP53 and also frequently including SMAD4 
and alterations of chromatin-modifying enzymes), leading to genomic 
instability and oncogenic amplifications without an antecedent WGD 
event. Despite the prevalence of clonal expansions of Barrett’s esopha­
gus tissues with somatic inactivation of TSGs such as CDKN2A and 
ARID1A, a minority of EACs appear to emerge following such a path 
without WGD. Instead, the majority of EACs apparently develop fol­
lowing expansion of a TP53-mutant clone that undergoes WGD, with 
WGD predominately seen in tissues with dysplasia. Genomic doubling 
has been documented to facilitate the acquisition of genomic instabil­
ity16,28,29. Consistent with this, tumors that emerged following WGD 
harbored marked genomic disruption and oncogene amplification, 
with amplifications of known oncogenes observed in 77 of 90 EAC 
samples with WGD. Following WGD, homozygous inactivation of 
tumor suppressors becomes more difficult owing to the additional 
number of events required14. Once WGD occurs, the more expedient 
pathway to transformation is thus likely that of acquisition of onco­
gene activation via structural genomic instability. The predilection for 
instability following WGD16,29–31 likely contributes to catastrophic 
genomic disruptions resulting in a large number of copy number alter­
ations, as recently identified by whole-genome sequencing of EAC32. 
This alternative pathway to transformation whereby a dysplastic clone 
with WGD acquires oncogene activation via amplification is supported 
by our findings that oncogene amplification is typically a later event in 
the progression to EAC. Such episodes of genomic disruption could 
lead to positive selection for distinct amplifications that bypass the 
need for loss of tumor suppressors, as more frequently occurs in EACs 
without WGD (Fig. 3). We note that it is also possible that cells with 
WGD are better able to survive catastrophic genomic disruption (for 
example, because such events are unlikely to generate complete gene 
knockouts) and may be less subject to negative selection. Although our 
limited data set did not identify differences in clinical stage between 
EACs with and without WGD (Supplementary Fig. 21), future studies 
will be needed to determine whether tumors following these distinct 
paths have other distinguishing clinical features.
Both WGD and TP53 mutations have been recognized for over 
a decade to be risk factors for the development of EAC in patients 
with Barrett’s esophagus7,23,33,34. Here we are able to refine the con­
ventional model of how these tumors emerge, finding that TP53 
mutations may be earlier events than previously recognized. After 
TP53 mutation, many EACs may follow a distinct pathway to can­
cer involving WGD with subsequent transformation to cancer via 
catastrophic aneuploidy and oncogene amplification. Our model 
is therefore consistent with a recent complementary report by 
Li et al.7 that characterized the copy number profiles of serially collected 
Barrett’s esophagus biopsies in which the authors noted that, in the 
24 months before cancer diagnosis, a marked increase in DNA 
content occurred, suggestive of WGD.
Our refined model positing a potentially more rapid path to 
transformation following the acquisition of a TP53 mutation and 
WGD may help explain the failure of endoscopic screening of patients 
with Barrett’s esophagus to prevent cancer diagnoses and deaths. 
Screening strategies are largely premised upon the concept that 
Barrett’s esophagus is at risk of the gradual accumulation of genomic 
alterations leading to progression to cancer. This model would predict 
that, just as aging predisposes to cancer, duration of Barrett’s esopha­
gus would also enhance cancer risk. However, contrary to this concept, 
studies of population cohorts of patients with diagnoses of Barrett’s 
esophagus show that the majority of EACs are detected within the first

Figure 8  Genome-doubled EAC shows a distinct pathway of development. The schematic shows two general pathways by which Barrett’s esophagus 
can develop into EAC. The top model involves the gradual accumulation of alterations in TSGs followed by the subsequent activation of oncogenes and 
development of genomic instability. In the bottom model, TP53 inactivation is acquired as an early event. The sample then undergoes genome doubling, 
leading to genomic instability, aneuploidy and oncogene amplification.

2 to 3 years of initial endoscopic diagnosis of Barrett’s esophagus, even 
when the incident endoscopy fails to identify dysplasia or cancer35–38. 
If most EACs emerge from Barrett’s esophagus following a more rapid 
process involving TP53 mutation and the emergence of an unstable, 
genomically doubled intermediate, new diagnostic strategies may be 
required that seek out these TP53-mutant precursors and intermedi­
ates as a means of detecting and preventing this deadly disease.

obtained with documented informed consent and institutional review board 
(IRB) approval. Fresh-frozen samples were obtained at the time of surgical 
esophagectomy from patients with a diagnosis of EAC and without neoadjuvant 
therapy from the University of Michigan. Samples of Barrett’s esophagus were 
selected not immediately adjacent to the tumor (when possible) to minimize 
tumor contamination within the Barrett’s esophagus sample. Slides stained 
with hematoxylin and eosin from 27 cases were examined by a pathologist 
with subspecialty training in gastrointestinal pathology. Slides from Barrett’s 
esophagus tissue were classified as either non-dysplastic or dysplastic. Samples 
with HGD and LGD were combined for primary analysis because of the overall 
low numbers and the diagnostic challenges and controversies associated with 
distinguishing between these entities (especially on frozen section slides). 
Additional subanalyses looked separately at these diagnoses. Two cases were 
excluded from further analysis as one case contained too low of a percentage 
of Barrett’s esophagus tissue and one Barrett’s esophagus tissue sample 
was contaminated with invasive tumor. DNA was extracted using phenol-
chloroform and ethanol precipitation and quantified using PicoGreen dsDNA 
Quantification reagent (Invitrogen).
Sample selection and DNA extraction (formalin fixed and paraffin 
embedded). With documented informed consent and IRB approval, 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) esophagectomy samples without 
neoadjuvant therapy were identified in the pathology archives of the University 
of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Slides 
stained with hematoxylin and eosin were reviewed by two gastrointestinal 
pathologists to determine consensus areas of Barrett’s esophagus, Barrett’s 
esophagus with LGD, Barrett’s esophagus with HGD and EAC. If uncer­
tainty for a diagnosis was present, a third pathologist reviewed the sample. 
Any sample without a consensus diagnosis was eliminated from analysis. 
Ten 8-micron sections were cut onto PEN membrane frame slides (Life 
Technologies) bracketed by standard slides for hematoxylin and eosin staining. 
The frame slides were stained using Arcturus paradise plus stain (Life 
Technologies) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Areas of inter­
est were microdissected using the ArcturusXT laser-capture microdissection 
instrument (Life Technologies). DNA was isolated using the Qiagen FFPE 
DNA isolation kit following the manufacturer’s protocol with the exception 
that the tissue was digested with proteinase K overnight. DNA was quantified 
using PicoGreen dsDNA Quantification reagent.
Whole-exome sequencing. Whole-exome capture libraries were constructed 
from 100 ng of DNA following shearing, end repair, phosphorylation and liga­
tion to barcoded sequencing adaptors39. DNA was size selected for lengths 
between 200 and 350 bp and subjected to exonic hybrid capture using SureSelect 
v2 Exome bait (Agilent). Samples were multiplexed and sequenced on multiple 
Illumina HiSeq flow cells. Mean target exome coverage of 95× was achieved in 
the DNA from Barrett’s esophagus samples, 85× was achieved for DNA from the 
neoplastic samples and 87× was achieved for the DNA from normal tissue.
Sequencing data processing. Exome sequence data processing and analysis 
were performed using Broad Institute pipelines as previously described40–43. 
A BAM file aligned to the hg19 human genome build was generated from 
sequencing reads for each sample by the Picard pipeline.
Mutation calling. The MuTect algorithm was used to identify somatic muta­
tions41,42,44. We required a minimum of 14 reads covering a site in the tumor 
and 8 reads in the normal sample for declaring a site to be adequately cov­
ered for mutation calling. We determined the lowest allelic fraction at which 
somatic mutations could be detected on a per-sample basis, using estimates 
of cross-contamination from the ContEst pipeline45. Small somatic insertions 
and deletions were detected using the Indelocator algorithm after local rea­
lignment of tumor and normal sequences44. All somatic mutations detected 
by whole-exome sequencing were analyzed for potential false positive calls 
by performing a comparison to mutation calls from a panel of 2,500 germ­
line DNA samples. Mutations found in 2% of the germline samples or 2% of 
sequencing reads were removed from analysis.
Because of our goal of comparing the presence and absence of mutations 
between distinct samples taken from the same patient, we used a tool designed 
to specifically query evidence for mutations or indels called in one sample for 
evidence of their presence, even at low allelic fraction, in other samples from 
the same patient. The strong prior of having been called de novo in one sample 
allowed for more sensitive detection in other related samples. This method, 
termed ‘force calling’, uses outputs from MuTect and Indelocator to generate 
an aggregate set of somatic events for each patient. It then adopts SAMtools 
to count the number of reads supporting the reference or alternate alleles at 
those sites in the other matched samples. Reads are considered if they are from 
unique pairs, have a base quality at the site of interest of greater than or equal 
to 20 and have a read quality of greater than or equal to 5.
Mutation annotation. Somatic single-nucleotide variants, insertions and 
deletions were annotated using Oncotator, which uses information from 
publicly available databases46–50.
Calculation of total and allelic copy numbers from whole-exome sequenc­
ing data. Genome-wide copy-ratio profiles were inferred using CAPSEG. Read 
depth at informative capture targets in tumor samples was calibrated to esti­
mate the copy ratio using depths observed in a panel of normal (non-cancer) 
diploid genomes. The resulting copy-ratio profiles were then segmented using 
the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm51. Allelic copy number ana­
lysis was then performed by examination of alternate and reference read counts 
at heterozygous SNP positions (as determined by analysis of the matched 
normal sample). These counts were used to infer the contribution of the two 
homologous chromosomes to the observed copy ratio in each segment. Further 
analysis of change points in these allelic ratios was performed using PSCBS52, 
refining the segmentation. Finally, for each segment, we combined the copy-
ratio and allelic data to derive allelic copy ratios, which were input for analysis 
with ABSOLUTE14.
The ABSOLUTE14 computational tool (v1.2) was used to provide com­
putational estimates of several parameters for each neoplastic sample in this 
study. These estimates include (i) the purity of each sample (fraction of nuclei 
in the sample originating from tumor or Barrett’s esophagus); (ii) the average 
ploidy of the cancer or Barrett’s esophagus genome; (iii) the presence of ante­
cedent genomic doubling for each genome; and (iv) the absolute allelic copy 
number across the genome. ABSOLUTE takes as input the segmented allelic 
copy number ratio data (as described above) as well as the allele fractions of 
somatic point mutations (aberrant reads as a ratio of total reads covering the 
locus) and then determines possible combinations of tumor purity, ploidy 
and antecedent genomic doubling, which fit the allelic copy number ratio 
data and point mutation variant allele fraction (VAF; Supplementary Fig. 9). 
The ABSOLUTE solutions were reviewed manually to maximize concordance 
with the data (A.T.-W.).
Calculation of point mutation CCF distributions. For each somatic muta­
tion, we computationally estimated the fraction of neoplastic cells within a 
specific DNA sample that harbored the mutation, i.e., the CCF. This fraction 
is represented as a distribution between 0 and 1 (refs. 14,53,54). A CCF value 
of 1 corresponds to a mutation present in 100% of the neoplastic cells in a 
sample. A CCF value of <1 indicates that the mutation is present in a subset 
of the neoplastic cells in a sample and thus is subclonal. Probability distribu­
tions for CCF values were computed by correcting mutant and reference read 
counts from Illumina sequencing for the estimated sample purity and local 
copy number14 (Supplementary Fig. 9), as previously described53,54.
After the initial determination of a CCF distribution for each mutation, 
we then performed an additional analysis to refine our CCF estimates, on the 
basis of the assumption that each neoplastic sample contained a small (but 
unknown) number of distinct populations defined by mutations that share the 
same CCF. We clustered mutations with similar CCF values by sampling from 
a mixture of Dirichlet processes using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
technique, as previously described (Supplementary Fig. 11a,b)53,54. We used 
250 MCMC iterations where the 125 initial ones were discarded as burn-in. 
A prior over the number of mutation clusters in a given sample was specified 
using a negative binomial distribution (r = 10, µ = 3), which favored 1–5 
clusters (Supplementary Fig. 11d). A partition of mutations was obtained

on the basis of how often each pair of mutations was assigned to the same 
cluster during the MCMC simulation (after convergence). A distance metric 
was generated from the inverse of each pair count, and hierarchical clustering 
was performed using complete linkage. The resulting tree was divided into 
k clusters, with k chosen as the lowest number of sampled clusters in the 
MCMC (Supplementary Fig. 11c,d).
Calculation of statistical power for detection of shared somatic mutations. 
To calculate power, we considered the expected VAF of a point mutation with 
CCF = 1 and multiplicity = 1, given the sample purity and local copy number. 
For mutations detected in only a subset of the tissue samples comprising a 
given case, we calculated the paired detection power. Because shared muta­
tions with a single supporting read matching the called allele were called by 
the forced calling procedure (described above), we calculated power as the 
probability of observing one or more such reads, given expected VAF and 
sequence coverage.
Relatedness calculations. Relatedness was calculated by taking the total 
number of shared mutations that were present at CCF = 1 in both samples 
divided by the sum of the total number of mutations with CCF = 1 in either 
sample (Supplementary Fig. 1). The relatedness using all mutations (CCF = 1 
and CCF < 1) was also calculated and is reported in Supplementary Table 1. 
We also searched for evidence of shared copy number aberrations, which 
would provide independent support for a potential common origin in an EAC–
Barrett’s esophagus pair beyond shared point mutations. For each segment in 
the EAC samples with copy number greater than 2.5 or less than 1.5, we looked 
at the matched Barrett’s esophagus sample to see whether there was also a seg­
ment greater than 2.5 or less than 1.5 that was 50% mutually overlapping with 
the segment in the EAC sample. If so, the segment was called shared. Using 
this analysis, we did not find any additional shared EAC–Barrett’s esophagus 
pairs not detected on the basis of shared somatic mutations.
Phylogenetic inference. Tumors can exhibit genetic heterogeneity, both across 
different regions55–58 and within single cancer tissue samples14,53,54,59–61. 
Heterogeneity within individual tissue samples presents a difficulty to simple 
phylogenetic inference algorithms, which typically distinguish only between 
the presence or absence of mutations in each sample. These algorithms attempt 
to construct phylogenetic trees relating each tissue sample, which may not 
accurately reflect the evolutionary relationships between the neoplastic cell 
populations represented in the tissue samples. For example, shared mutations 
(present in multiple samples) due to overlapping subclonal populations would 
be mistaken as evidence for shared ancestry between the samples.
To address this difficulty, we used quantitative information about each muta­
tion’s prevalence in each neoplastic tissue sample (CCF) to determine whether 
the tissue samples were sufficiently diverged from one another such that no 
detectable overlap of minor subclones occurred (CCF < 1), a scenario we term 
the ‘branched sibling’ model. In this scenario, it is valid to construct standard 
phylogenetic trees relating each tissue sample, with minor subclones (CCF < 1) 
private to each tissue sample represented as subtrees (microphylogenies) 
grafted on to each sample tip. The branched sibling scenario implies that such 
trees accurately represent the evolutionary relationship of all subclonal popula­
tions detected with CCF = 1 in the sampled neoplastic tissues. A corollary of 
the branched sibling model is that all mutations shared in two or more samples 
must have CCF = 1 wherever they are present (Supplementary Fig. 12a,b). 
Thus, the appearance of mutations shared in two or more samples with 
CCF <1 in any of them either represents a technical artifact or constitutes 
evidence that the branched sibling approximation is not an accurate descrip­
tion of those samples.
We constructed phylogenetic trees representing the evolutionary relation­
ship between the neoplastic tissue samples sequenced from each patient using 
a semiautomated four-stage process, described below. First, we searched for 
the optimal tree that would explain the observed matrix of binary point muta­
tion presence or absence data in each sample, given the standard phylogenetic 
assumptions that specific mutations arise uniquely in each patient and that 
there were negligible rates of mutation loss (for example, due to chromosomal 
deletion of a mutant allele). We searched for the phylogenetic tree with 
maximum parsimony using the standard parsimony ratchet method62.
Second, we applied the Bayesian CCF clustering procedure described above 
to each sample individually, retaining all mutations provisionally called with 
>0 supporting reads in that sample. A single pseudocount observation was 
added corresponding to a cluster at CCF = 1. We then identified all provi­
sional mutation calls (>0 supporting reads) made in at least two samples 
of the case that were assigned to a CCF cluster with a posterior mode <1.0 
(Supplementary Fig. 12). These mutation calls represent either sequencing 
artifacts or evidence for overlapping minor subclones in the sampled neo­
plastic tissues (violating the branched sibling approximation). We rejected 
such sites if the number of supporting reads was <3, and this modified matrix 
of mutation calls was then used to assign each mutation to a branch of the 
phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. 12b).
We also distinguished mutations that were underpowered for detection 
in some samples (as described above). For each sample, the number of muta­
tions in each category is shown in Supplementary Figure 12c. Assignment 
of gene-level SCNAs to branches was performed in a similar manner 
(Supplementary Fig. 12d).
Third, we refined the tips of each phylogenetic tree by distinguishing 
between private mutations that occurred in all neoplastic cells of a given 
sample (CCF = 1) compared to those that occurred in only a minor subclone 
(CCF < 1) specific to that sample. For this distinction, we applied Bayesian 
clustering techniques (described above) to the mutations identified only in 
that sample. We added n pseudocount observations of CCF = 1, with n rep­
resenting the number of mutations called in >1 sample of the case that were 
also called in the sample being considered. This process partitioned the private 
mutations in each sample into putative subclones with common CCF values 
(Supplementary Fig. 10). We modified the phylogenetic trees by replacing 
each (non-germline) tip with the subtree consistent with the maximally branch­
ing microphylogeny respecting the rule that the sum of sibling subclone CCF 
values could not exceed that of their most recent common ancestor (Figs. 4 
and 5, and Supplementary Fig. 13).
Fourth, we examined whether evidence that the branched sibling model 
was not an adequate approximation of the sampled neoplastic tissues could 
be discerned. For each case, we analyzed the two-dimensional CCF distribu­
tions of point mutations for all unique tissue sample pairs (Supplementary 
Fig. 11) using a two-dimensional version of the Bayesian clustering algorithm 
described above63. Examination of these data showed robust clusters of muta­
tions with CCF = 1 in both samples of clonally related pairs. In addition, many 
pairs harbored mutations with CCF = 1 in one sample that were undetected 
in the paired sample (and vice versa). Most samples also harbored mutations 
with CCF < 1 that were undetected in the paired sample. Furthermore, for 
most patients, only a small fraction of mutations with CCF < 1 appeared to 
be detected in both sample pairs, and these mutations did not tend to form 
strong clusters (consistent with sequencing artifacts; Supplementary Fig. 11). 
Taken together, these observations implied that most tissue samples were well 
approximated by the branched sibling model (Supplementary Fig. 11), as true 
overlap of minor populations from distinct subclonal branches would tend to 
displace the CCF values of mutations private to each sample, such that none 
would have CCF = 1.
In the two cases where evidence contradicting the branched sibling model 
was observed, phylogenetic trees were manually adjusted (as described below) 
to accurately reflect the evolutionary relationship between the different clonal 
lineages (shown in Figs. 4 and 5). This was done in a manner analogous to 
that described in a recent report61; here we extended similar logic to the 
scenario where the same subclone was present in multiple tissue samples. 
Detailed analysis of mutation CCFs for each patient, including the automati­
cally generated phylogenetic trees (before manual adjustment), are available 
in Supplementary Data Sets 3 and 4.
For patients 4 and 6, nearly every shared mutation had CCF = 1. For 
patient P1, the shared mutations with CCF < 1 did not appear to form a 
strong cluster or to displace other clusters away from CCF = 1. We therefore 
assumed that these mutations did not constitute strong evidence of a branched 
sibling violation and accepted the automatically produced phylogenies 
for these cases.
For patient P3, we detected a minor population in sample EAC1 (subclone 1; 
CCF = 0.2) defined by 45–200 mutations (which were present at CCF = 1 in 
the shared MET1-HGD1-EAC2 branch. We adjusted the phylogenetic tree

(Fig. 5b) to move EAC1 onto a distinct branch from these samples to represent 
the dominant subclone (subclone 2; CCF = 0.8) in EAC1, which had an evo­
lutionary origin distinct from that of subclone 1. In addition, samples HGD1 
and MET1 appeared to share a small subclone (CCF = 0.05) defined by five 
mutations that did not appear elsewhere in the case. We removed the shared 
branch defined by these mutations from the phylogeny as these mutations did 
not reflect shared recent ancestry of the dominant subclones in HGD1 and 
MET1 (Fig. 5b). For patient P7, details regarding phylogenetic tree generation 
are provided in the main text.
FISH analysis. In patient P3, we wanted to confirm the genome-doubling 
status in two apparent genomically unrelated tumors. ABSOLUTE predicted 
that one of the samples had undergone a genomic-doubling event, whereas the 
other did not. We performed FISH analysis co-labeling a 4-µm FFPE section 
with two differently labeled centromeric markers for chromosomes that are 
relatively stable in EAC (CEP 2 and CEP 4). After review and identification 
of the areas of interest, the probes were enumerated by two senior research 
technologists within the Brigham and Women’s cytogenomics core facility. 
Each technologist counted 50 cells per sample, and the number of CEP 2 
and CEP 4 probes per cell were averaged. In patient P7, we performed FISH 
for KRAS and CEP 12 from samples LGD1, HGD2 and EAC1 to confirm the 
finding that the amplification was present in EAC1 but not the premalignant 
lesions. FISH was performed on the paired samples BE 63 and EAC 63 for 
ERBB2 and CEP 17. All FISH studies were performed with standard tech­
niques. The gene to CEP ratio was calculated, and a ratio of greater than two 
was considered positive.
