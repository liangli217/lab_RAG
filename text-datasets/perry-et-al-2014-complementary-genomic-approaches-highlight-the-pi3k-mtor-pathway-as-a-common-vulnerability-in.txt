Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor, yet there
have been no substantial advances in treatment or survival in three
decades. We examined 59 tumor/normal pairs by whole-exome,
whole-genome, and RNA-sequencing. Only the TP53 gene was mu-
tated at significant frequency across all samples. The mean nonsilent
somatic mutation rate was 1.2 mutations per megabase, and there
was a median of 230 somatic rearrangements per tumor. Complex
chains of rearrangements
and
localized hypermutation were
detected in almost all cases. Given the intertumor heterogeneity,
the extent of genomic instability, and the difficulty in acquiring a
large sample size in a rare tumor, we used several methods to identify
genomic events contributing to osteosarcoma survival. Pathway
analysis, a heuristic analytic algorithm, a comparative oncology ap-
proach, and an shRNA screen converged on the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) pathway as
a central vulnerability for therapeutic exploitation in osteosarcoma.
Osteosarcoma cell lines are responsive to pharmacologic and genetic
inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway both in vitro and in vivo.
osteosarcoma | TP53 | PI3K | mTOR | genomics
O
steosarcoma (OS), the most common primary bone tumor,
is an aggressive cancer that affects children, adolescents,
and young adults. In contrast to the improvements in 5-year
overall survival for childhood cancers from 58% to 82% in the
past three decades, the overall survival for pediatric OS has
remained static over that same time period at 60% (1, 2).
Predisposition to OS is associated with germline syndromes,
including hereditary retinoblastoma and Li-Fraumeni syndrome
(3, 4). OS is also seen in syndromes with mutations in RECQ
helicases and SQSTM1 (5, 6). However, most cases of OS de-
velop sporadically and are characterized by complex genomics.
The first genome-wide association study conducted in OS only
identified two susceptibility loci implicating one gene, GRM4, a
glutamate receptor (7).
Linkage with hereditary retinoblastoma and Li Fraumeni led
to the recognition of recurrent somatic alterations in TP53, RB1,
and genes interacting with TP53 and RB1 in OS (8, 9). Candi-
date-gene approaches demonstrated recurrent somatic muta-
tions, deletions, and rearrangement affecting TP53 (9). Additional
mechanisms of p53 inactivation described in OS are MDM2 and
COPS3 amplification (8, 9). RB1 mutations are present in 6% and
deletions or structural alterations are seen in 40% of cases (10,
11). CDKN2A is deleted in 10–20% of OS (9, 12). Multiple other
cancer-associated genes have been reported to be altered in OS
[reviewed in Kansara and Thomas (5)]. Many of these studies
Significance
We present, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive next-
generation sequencing of osteosarcoma in combination with
a functional genomic screen in a genetically defined mouse
model of osteosarcoma. Our data provide a strong rationale for
targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target
of rapamycin pathway in osteosarcoma and a foundation for
rational clinical trial design. These findings present an imme-
diate clinical opportunity because multiple inhibitors of this
pathway are currently in clinical trials.

investigating somatic alterations in specific genes were performed
on small numbers of tumors with low-throughput techniques. More
recently, next-generation sequencing of 34 osteosarcomas identi-
fied recurrent alterations in ATRX and DLG2, in addition to TP53
and RB1 (13). This next-generation sequencing study used in
depth analysis of whole-genome sequence data and demonstrated
that OS tumors have multiple rearrangements across the genome,
kataegis, and a high degree of intratumor heterogeneity. Chro-
mothripsis has been described in selected cases (14, 15). To date,
none of these discoveries have led to the development of molec-
ularly targeted therapies or improved survival for OS patients.
Because treatment for OS has not changed appreciably in the
past 30 years, new approaches to treating the disease are im-
perative. We sought to identify tractable therapeutic targets in
OS by performing next-generation sequencing and a compre-
hensive analysis of the genomic alterations in OS. We antici-
pated challenges in identifying a gene or genes altered in a large
proportion of cases because of the difficulty collecting a large
sample size in such a rare tumor, genomic complexity and het-
erogeneity. We hypothesized that we could identify genes or
pathways required for OS survival by combining sequencing data
with four methods for identifying essential genes, including: (i)
pathway analysis, based on the mutational profile; (ii) a heuristic
algorithm used to identify alterations with the potential to be
clinically actionable; (iii) a comparative oncology approach using
whole exome sequencing from a mouse model of OS; and (iv)
a genome-wide functional shRNA screen in murine OS to identify
essential genes. Taken together, the data implicate the phosphati-
dylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR)
pathway as a key target for the treatment of OS.
Results
Clinical and Sequence Data Characteristics. We examined OS tu-
mor/normal (blood) sample pairs by whole-genome sequencing
(WGS; 13 cases), whole-exome sequencing (WES; 59 cases), and
RNA-Sequencing (RNASeq; 35 cases) (Fig. 1). Clinical features
of the patient population including outcome were typical for OS,
with the exception of a higher proportion (47%) with metastases
at diagnosis (Fig. S1A). All cases except two were sporadic, and
no patients had clinically apparent germline syndromes associ-
ated with OS.
WES of ∼33 Mb of protein-coding sequence yielded a median of
103× tumor (range 60×–188×) and normal (range 56×–206×) depth
of coverage. A median of 88.2% (range 84–91%) of exonic bases
were powered for discovering mutations. WGS yielded a median of
36× tumor (range 30×–61×) tumor and 35× normal (range 27×–
38×) depth of coverage. In WGS, a median of 89% of genomic
bases (range 87–90%) were powered for discovering mutations.
Bases were considered powered for discovering mutations if they
were covered with at least 14 reads in the tumor sample and at least
8 reads in the normal sample. The thresholds were selected to
achieve 80% power for mutations at an allelic fraction of 0.3 (16).
Deleterious Germline Variants in TP53 Are Common in Osteosarcoma.
We examined germline variants of the 59 normal samples by
WES. Twenty rare nonsilent variants were present in nine
candidate genes after excluding missense variants classified as
“benign” by PolyPhen-2 (Table S1) (17). Variants present in
more than two normal samples were detected in only two genes:
TP53 (n = 7) and SQSTM1 (n = 4). Germline mutations in
TP53 were present at a higher frequency (12%) than previously
reported (3%) (4). All seven TP53 variants were previously
reported. We also examined somatic loss of heterozygosity of
the germline variant alleles and found that only TP53 germline
variants were subject to a “second hit” by loss of heterozygosity
of the wild-type allele (Table S1). Four rare nonsilent nucleo-
tide variants in SQSTM1 were identified. Three of these were
identical: p.K238E, a SNP (rs11548633) in the TRAF6 binding
domain, and p.A426V, a mutation previously linked to Paget’s
disease of bone (18).
Osteosarcoma Marked by High Mutation Rate and Kataegis. In the
coding regions of the OS genomes (59 WES samples), we detected
a median of 37 somatic, nonsilent mutations per case (range 7–
237), corresponding to a median somatic mutation rate of 1.2
mutations per megabase. To better understand the mechanisms
leading to mutations in OS, we examined the distribution and
categories of somatic point mutations across the genome. We ob-
served a prevalence of localized hypermutation, in particular in-
volving closely spaced C > T and C > G mutations in TpCpX
trinucleotide contexts in several samples. This phenomenon,
termed kataegis, was recently described in breast cancer and,
subsequently, OS (13, 19). Using “rainfall” plots of C > T and C >
G mutations derived from WGS, we identified kataegis in 11 of 13
(85%) OS samples. As previously described, kataegis events over-
lapped with genomic rearrangements in OS (Fig. 2). Kataegis has
been linked, in other diseases, to APOBEC family proteins, which
play a role in innate antiviral defense (19). To test the hypothesis of
viral involvement, we examined WGS, WES, and RNASeq data for
the presence of viral nucleic acid sequences by PathSeq but did not
detect any enrichment (20).
Osteosarcomas Exhibit Genomic Complexity and Heterogeneity.
Copy number analysis using the WES data from 59 samples
with GISTIC2 revealed 15 significant arm-level events, 15 sig-
nificant focal amplifications, and 22 significant focal deletions
(Fig. S1B and Datasets S1 and S2) (21). The observed focal copy
number alterations in this study are consistent with previous
reports. The most significant focal deletions included the genes
RB1, TP53, and CDKN2A/B (9, 10, 12). The most significant focal
amplifications were in the COPS3, CCNE1, CDK4, and MYC
genes, and 6p12.3 amplifications (8, 22).
In the 13 WGS samples, a median of 230 (range 3–1,059)
rearrangements per OS genome were observed, which is much
higher than that seen in 275 TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)
tumor/normal WGS samples from other tumor types [median 48
(range 0–699), P < 3.5e-5, one-sided Mann–Whitney test] (23).
No recurrent fusion events were found; however, rearrangements
with breakpoints near TP53 occurred with highest frequency
among 2,586 genes (Dataset S3). Additionally, RNAseq data re-
vealed that TP53 was a recurrent fusion partner (3 of 35 samples)
(Dataset S3). Integrative analysis of genomic breakpoints and copy
number data were performed using the ChainFinder algorithm
(24). Complex rearrangements indicative of chromoplexy were
abundant in OS, and could be identified in samples both with high
and low degrees of overall genomic rearrangement (25). We
detected complex chains of rearrangements in 11 OS genomes
(Fig. 2 and Dataset S4). The percentage of chromosomal break-
points involved in a chain ranged from 27–70% (median 44%)
across osteosarcomas. Chains of rearrangements from all tumors
involved multiple chromosomes (median 4, range 3–6) and all but
one involved multiple “deletion bridges” (median 6, range 0–29),
which indicate large segments of DNA deletions at fusion junc-
tions. Consistent with observations in other cancer types, regions
of kataegis were highly correlated with copy number breakpoints
and rearrangement sites.
OS samples are heterogeneous and highly complex. Among the
59 WES samples we analyzed, estimates of sample purity ranged
from 19 to 100% (median 55%) and average cancer cell ploidy
ranged from 1.42 to 4.31 (median 2.09). This finding is consistent
with the massive complexity revealed by rearrangement analysis
and points to frequent occurrence of genome doublings in OS:
indeed, 12 of 55 (12.8%) samples for which ploidy estimations
were obtained had ploidy above 3 (Dataset S5).

Frequent Alterations in TP53 and RB1 and in TP53 and RB1 Interacting
Genes. Analysis of sequencing data using algorithms optimized
for identifying recurrent events across samples identified a lim-
ited number of events, previously known to occur in OS. The
MutSigCV (mutation significance) algorithm identified only one
gene mutated at significant frequency across the 59 WES sam-
ples (at q-value threshold of 0.1): TP53 (Fig. 1 and Dataset S6)
(26). TP53 was mutated in 22% of samples. 85% of the TP53
mutations were missense or frameshift mutations in the DNA
binding domain (Fig. S1C). Of the genes listed in the COSMIC
database, the only other genes with nonsilent mutations occur-
ring in more than one case were RB1 and PTEN (27, accessed
May, 2014).
We examined each sample for the presence of known
mechanisms of TP53 and RB1 inactivation and for alterations in
known TP53 and RB1 interacting genes (Fig. 1). The results are
summarized in Table 1. Fifty-six percent of cases had alter-
ations resulting in both TP53 and RB1 inactivation. Inactivation
of TP53 was observed in 75% of cases and surprisingly, 34% of
cases have multiple mechanisms of TP53 inactivation. The types
and relative frequency of genomic events in TP53 and RB1 are
similar to prior reports (10, 11). Amplification of MDM2 and
COPS3, proteins proposed to negatively regulate TP53 protein
stability, were observed in 5% and 39% of cases, respectively (8, 9).
Alterations in PI3K/mTOR Pathway Genes Are Frequent in Osteosarcoma.
To overcome difficulties in identifying significant common
alterations in a tumor with high intra- and intertumor het-
erogeneity and relatively small sample size, we combined mul-
tiple analytical and genomic approaches to deepen the analysis.

First, we combined gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with
mutational analysis and identified 32 pathways as being signifi-
cantly affected by mutations across the 59 WES samples using the
GSEA MSigDB Canonical Pathway collection (q < 0.1) (Dataset
S7) (28, 29). Twenty-two pathways, including the 21 most significant
pathways, contained TP53 and are likely significant because of the
frequency of mutations in this gene (TP53 was the only significantly
mutated gene across samples) (Fig. 3A). Of the remaining 10 sig-
nificant pathways, 4 implicate the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway:
PTEN, IGF1/mTOR, RAS, and AKT (Fig. 3B). Four more path-
ways were statistically significant and contained members of the
PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway but not TP53: IL2RB, RACCYCD,
IL-7, and HCMV.
Pathway analysis indicated that the PI3K/mTOR pathway may
be altered in OS, so we evaluated each genome individually with
the objective of identifying mutations and copy number alter-
ations in known cancer pathways, particularly those potentially
inhibited with targeted therapies. To identify the most clinically
relevant alterations in each sample, analysis of sequencing data
and ranking of gene alterations by biologic and clinical relevance
was performed using the Precision Heuristics for Interpreting the
Alteration Landscape (PHIAL) algorithm (Dataset S8) (30).
Samples contained a range of one to five potentially actionable
alterations. This method identified 24% of patients as having
alterations in the PI3K/mTOR pathway (Fig. 1 and Table 2). There
were five PTEN deletions, a PTEN nonsense mutation, and
a PTEN frameshift mutation. There were two TSC2 tuberin domain
mutations, both previously reported to occur in individuals affected
by tuberous sclerosis. There was an NF1 frameshift mutation. A
PIK3CA mutation at amino acid position 545, a mutation hotspot,
was identified (27, accessed April 9, 2013). Mutations were iden-
tified in PI3K/mTOR pathway components PDPK1, AKT1, and
EIF4B and are predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 (31). For
PDPK1 and AKT1, mutations resulted in amino acid changes in key
protein domains. The PIK3R1 and one of the EIF4B mutations
were not predicted to be damaging. In addition to PI3K/mTOR
pathway alterations, PHIAL identified the presence of additional
alterations, suggesting the potential for response to targeted
agents (Table 2). The genes affected include MYC, growth
factor receptor tyrosine kinases, Wnt pathway members, cell
cycle regulatory molecules, and coordinators of DNA repair. In
total, 20 of 59 patients (34%) had alterations with potential clinical
implications. This method also identified alterations in epigenetic
regulators SUZ12, ATRX, and ARID1A (Fig. 1).
Next, in a comparative oncology approach, we sequenced nine
tumor/normal pairs (WES) from a mouse model of OS created via
conditional deletion of Tp53 and Rb1 in the preosteoblast (Dataset
S9) (32). Two PI3K/mTOR pathway genes were affected by so-
matic mutations in both mouse and human tumors: PTEN and
PIK3R1. The Pten mutation in the murine tumor was a nonsense
mutation p.Y16*. The Pik3r1 missense mutation, p.S629N, lies
within the C-terminal Src homology 2 domain, a region demon-
strated to be affected by mutations in endometrial cancer (33).
Pik3ca and Mtor Are Essential for Osteosarcoma Proliferation and
Survival. Finally, we performed a functional genomics screen to
try to understand the relationship between the complicated ge-
notype in OS and the functional dependencies in an unbiased
fashion. To identify genes essential for the proliferation and sur-
vival of OS, we performed a genome-wide, pooled shRNA screen
in a primary cell line derived from murine OS (mOS482) (Fig. 4A)
(32). Cells were infected with a pool of 40,000 lentivirally
delivered shRNAs, targeting ∼8,400 genes (Dataset S10). The

relative abundance of each shRNA at the endpoint (18 doublings)
relative to the initial reference pool was determined by massively
parallel sequencing of the lentiviral DNA. Individual hairpins
were rank ordered and RNAi gene enrichment (RIGER) analysis
was used to collapse the normalized shRNA ranked list to gene
rankings by two statistical methods: a weighted second best (P ≤
0.05) method and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (P ≤0.05) non-
parametric rank statistic (Dataset S11 and S12). At the inter-
section were 172 genes. The 172 genes were enriched for cell cycle
genes but also included Pik3ca, the α-catalytic subunit of PI3K,
and Mtor (Fig. 4B and Dataset S13). shRNAs against these
genes were inhibitory to mOS cell growth (mOS482 and
mOS202) while having minimal effect on a noncancerous bone
cell (Kusa4b10) (Fig. 4C) (34). To determine whether gene can-
didates identified in the in vitro screen were essential for OS pro-
liferation and survival in vivo, we screened for shRNAs that become
depleted upon OS formation in mice. A pool of shRNAs targeting
Pik3ca, Mtor, and controls (four shRNAs per gene) was introduced
into mOS482 cells that were then transplanted into recipient mice
(Fig. S2A). Six weeks later, orthotopic tumors were isolated and
massively parallel DNA sequencing was used to determine the
abundance of each shRNA from tumors and preinjection cells.
shRNAs against Pik3ca and Mtor were significantly depleted com-
pared with control shRNAs (Fig. 4D). To confirm isoform specificity
of PI3K’s role in OS cell growth, three distinct mouse OS cell lines
(mOS202, mOS482, and mOS493) were infected with shRNAs tar-
geting Pik3ca or Pik3cb (Fig. S2B). Compared with both control
and Pik3cb knockdown, Pik3ca knockdown caused growth arrest
in mOS cells (Fig. 4E). Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo
shRNA screen data indicate that OS cell line proliferation and
tumor formation are dependent on the Pik3ca and Mtor genes.
PI3K/mTOR Inhibitors Suppress Osteosarcoma Proliferation. The oc-
currence of alterations in the PI3K/mTOR pathway in 24% of
human OS samples and the identification of Pik3ca and Mtor in
the murine OS genomic shRNA screen suggest that the PI3K/
mTOR pathway is a potential unifying vulnerability to be exploited
for targeted therapy in OS. Consequently, the PI3K/mTOR dual
inhibitors GSK2126458 and BEZ235 and the PIK3CA-selective
inhibitor PIK75 were tested against four human and three murine
OS cell lines and MCF7 cells, a breast cancer cell line with
a PIK3CA p.E545K mutation previously demonstrated to undergo

TP53 and PI3K/mTOR pathways are significantly mutated in osteo-
sarcoma. GSEA combined with mutational analysis (MutSig2.0) identified 32
significantly mutated pathways (MSigDB Canonical Pathway gene sets) across
59 human osteosarcoma WES samples (q < 0.1). (A) Twenty-two pathways
included the TP53 gene and (B) eight pathways implicated the PI3K/mTOR
pathway by inclusion of PIK3CA and/or MTOR, while excluding TP53.

apoptosis in response to treatment with the dual inhibitors (35).
All three inhibitors inhibited cell proliferation in all cell lines
tested (Figs. 5A and 5B and Fig. S2C), but a PIK3CB-selective
compound, TGX-221, had little effect on cell proliferation at
concentrations up to 10 μM (Fig. S2D). In the murine and human
OS cell lines, the IC50s of GSK2126458 and PIK75 ranged from 7
to 169 nM, similar to the IC50 observed in the MCF7 cells,
demonstrating the sensitivity of OS cell lines to inhibition of
PIK3CA or PI3K/mTOR. PIK75 and GSK2126458 readily in-
duced apoptosis with treatment as shown by caspase 3/7 activation
(Fig. S2E) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage
(Fig. 5C, assessed only for PIK75). Growth inhibition and apo-
ptosis were seen at drug levels at which phosphorylated AKT
(Ser473) and, in the case of GSK2126458, phosphorylated S6
(Ser235/236) levels were reduced (Fig. 5C and Fig. S2F). The IC50
of BEZ235 was 8–51 nM in human cell lines and 178 nM to 1.2
μM in murine cell lines. BEZ235 appeared to cause cytostatic cell
growth and did not induce caspase 3/7 activation or PARP
cleavage in OS cell lines (Fig. 5C and Fig. S2E). These data are
consistent with a recent study that reports the anti-proliferative
and antitumor effects of BEZ235 on OS cell lines (36).
Discussion
Although none of the patients included in this study had docu-
mented Li Fraumeni syndrome, rare nonsilent mutations were
present in TP53 in 12% cases. In previous studies, germline
mutations in TP53 were present in fewer than 3% of patients
with OS without a history suggestive of Li Fraumeni syndrome
(4). The higher rate of germline mutations detected in this study
may be due to or attributable to the nature of the patient pop-
ulation, with a large number of patients from Brazil, where there
is a 0.3% population incidence of the p.R337H mutation (37). In
our study, 39 of 59 patients were from Brazil and 6 patients had
germline TP53 mutations (15% of Brazilian patients), and 3 of
these patients harbored the p.R337H mutation (8% of Brazilian
patients). Another possible explanation is the improved ability to
detect TP53 mutations using modern techniques compared with
previously used techniques. If these results are confirmed in
other study populations, patients with sporadic OS should be
referred to a genetic counselor for discussion of testing for Li
Fraumeni syndrome, which would constitute a change in clinical
practice.
We found four rare nonsilent nucleotide variants in SQSTM1,
three of which were identical: p.K238E is a SNP (rs11548633) in the
TRAF6 binding domain with a minor allele frequency of 0.003
(National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Variant Server).
Because of the small study size, strong statistical conclusions re-
garding the association between the SQSTM1 p.K238E SNP and OS
are not possible. The relationship between SQSTM1 SNPs and OS

should be evaluated using methodologies more suited to identifying
germline associations, such as genome-wide association studies.
In the context of pediatric cancers, OS is unique with regards to
the somatic mutation rate and the somatic rearrangement rate (26).
Pediatric cancers, such as retinoblastoma and rhabdoid tumor, both
aggressive malignancies occurring in very young children, have ex-
tremely low somatic mutation frequencies. Even those pediatric
cancers with higher somatic mutation frequencies, such as neuro-
blastoma and medulloblastoma, have ∼0.4–0.5 mutations per
megabase (26). In contrast to these tumor types, the median so-
matic nonsilent mutation frequency in OS was much higher at 1.2
mutations per megabase. This frequency approaches the median
somatic mutation frequency of 1.5 mutations per megabase found
in a study of 3,083 tumors of 27 different types, including both
childhood and adult cancers (26). This finding suggests an alter-
native mechanism of transformation in OS tumors compared with
other common childhood tumors.
We observed kataegis in 11 of 13 (85%) WGS samples, which
is higher than the prevalence of kataegis reported in another
cohort of OS samples (50%) (13). Both cohorts are small and so
the true prevalence of kataegis remains to be determined once a
larger cohort of samples has been analyzed. Similarly, sequenc-
ing depth and purity decrease the sensitivity for detecting alter-
ations, so it is possible that we are underestimating the frequency
of mutations and structural alterations, and thus kataegis, in OS.
In their study of breast cancers, Nik-Zainal et al. (19) suggested
that APOBEC1 and APOBEC3s cytidine deaminases may be
responsible for the kataegis phenomenon. Because our results
and others point to kataegis as a mutational mechanism in OS,
we suggest further investigation of the role of APOBEC enzymes
in this tumor type.
Complex chains of rearrangements were present in 92% of the
OS tumors studied and we observed a median of 230 rearrange-
ments per OS genome, which is higher than previously suggested
(15). Although direct comparison of the number and complexity
of the rearrangements seen in OS to other pediatric cancers is not
possible, OS appear to have a much greater frequency and com-
plexity of structural variations (38). The frequent inactivation of
TP53 may play a role in structural instability in OS, as has been
reported in medulloblastoma (39). However, whether genomic
instability is simply a byproduct of TP53 inactivation or is, in and
of itself, a mechanism of osteosarcomagenesis remains to be an-
swered. In summary, OS is one of the only cancers identified to
date that occurs in younger patients in a site not exposed to
carcinogens that has a relatively high somatic mutation rate and
a very high rate and degree of complexity of structural alterations.
This makes OS a model tumor in which to identify mechanisms
driving processes, such as kataegis and chromoplexy, and the role
of these processes in oncogenesis.
This study confirms the importance and prevalence of TP53 and
RB1 inactivation by genomic events, which either affect the TP53
and RB1 genes directly or which alter TP53/RB1-interacting genes.
Seventy-five percent of samples contained at least one somatic
event in TP53, which is higher than the 40% previously reported in
studies using candidate gene methods (5, 9). We report a slightly
lower proportion (75%) of somatic events in TP53 than the 90%
rate reported by Chen et al. in their comprehensive next genera-
tion sequencing study (13). This result is likely a result of lack of
detection of structural variations in TP53 in our study, because
only 22% of tumors were subjected to WGS. MDM2 amplification
was seen in only 5% of tumors, less often than the 25% frequency
previously reported (5, 8, 9, 40–43). Whereas previous studies have
reported lack of overlapping mechanisms of TP53 inactivation,

Small-molecule inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR inhibit osteosarcoma proliferation. Human OS cell lines (MG63, U2OS, SJSA, and HOS) and MCF7 cells (breast
cancer cell line with an activating mutation in PIK3CA) were treated with (A) BEZ235 or (B) PIK75 or DMSO (control) for 24 h and viability was assessed with
CellTiter-Glo. Experiments were conducted with eight replicates and displayed results are representative of three independent experiments. (C) Cells were
treated with BEZ235 and PIK75 for 4 h and the effects on the PI3K/mTOR pathway were assessed. Cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with
antibodies against phosphorylated AKT (Ser473), AKT, phosphorylated S6 (Ser235/236), S6, PARP, and GAPDH (loading control).

specifically lack of MDM2 or COPS3 amplification in osteosarco-
mas with TP53 mutations, 34% of our cases have multiple mech-
anisms of TP53 inactivation. The analysis of mutations (germline
and somatic), copy number changes, and rearrangements of mul-
tiple genes in one study also allowed us to determine that 56% of
the tumors have both TP53 and RB1 inactivated.
Pathway analysis of mutated genes, clinical interpretation of
individual genomes (PHIAL), a comparative oncology approach,
and a genomic screen all point to a dependence on PI3K/mTOR
pathway activation in OS. To our knowledge, this is the first study
to report genomic alterations in PI3K/mTOR pathway members in
a significant proportion of OS tumors (24%). PTEN deletion has
been evaluated in a single study in which 4 of 27 osteosarcomas
had biallelic deletion of PTEN, a similar rate of occurrence as seen
in this study (44). A PTEN mutation has been detected in a single
canine OS cell line but mutations in PTEN have not been pre-
viously described in human OS samples (45). One recent study
using a sequenom assay identified mutations in PIK3CA in 3 of 89
tumors (46). However, the other PI3K/mTOR pathway members
(PDPK1, AKT1, and EIF4B) containing somatic mutations in this
study have not previously been recognized to harbor alterations in
OS. Additionally, the PI3K/mTOR pathway is activated by many
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and the pathway has been
recognized as a critical effector of alterations that activate RTKs
in cancer (47). PHIAL analysis implicated six alterations in RTKs
in eight patients (PDGFRA, PDGRFB, JAK1, ALK, KDR, and
FGFR4). These patients may benefit from selective RTK inhib-
itors, but it also reasons that these tumors may be sensitive to
inhibition with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.
In addition, our in vitro and in vivo shRNA screen data
strongly suggest that OS cell line proliferation and tumor for-
mation are dependent on the Pik3ca and Mtor genes signifying
that kinase activity of the PI3K/mTOR pathway is required for
OS survival. These data are consistent with an earlier report that
used kinome profiling to show that AKT (an intermediary kinase
in the PI3K/mTOR pathway) is active in OS and its inhibition
blocks cell proliferation (48). Interestingly, genetic ablation of
either Pik3ca or Mtor is sufficient to halt cell proliferation and
slow tumor formation. This finding suggests that agents that can
inhibit either Pik3ca or Mtor individually should have a similar
effect, but experimental evidence from other tumor types dem-
onstrates that many tumors can acquire resistance to single-target
inhibitors (49). Thus, a combination of PI3K and mTOR in-
hibitors or a dual inhibitor may help overcome feedback loops
and pathway cross-talk that can mediate resistance.
The universal sensitivity of both human and murine OS cells
demonstrates that mutation of PI3K/mTOR is not necessary to
confer sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in OS. Using data
from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, we determined that
HOS cells, which harbor an NF1 deletion, are the only human
OS cell line used in these studies with an alteration in a PI3K/
mTOR pathway member (50). In the HOS cell line the IC50 of
BEZ235 was 40 nM, the second highest IC50 of the cell lines
studied, and the IC50 of PIK75 was 82 nM, the highest IC50 of the
cell lines studied. The presence of an NF1 deletion does not
seem to confer increased sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in
this panel of human OS cell lines. However, because all of the
human OS cell lines display a high degree of sensitivity to PI3K/
mTOR pathway inhibitors, it would be difficult to detect
increased sensitivity.
Genomic alterations in PI3K/mTOR pathway members is
likely only one way in which the PI3K/mTOR pathway becomes
active in OS. p70S6K expression, a measure of pathway activity,
is present in 70–80% of OS and the level of expression has been
correlated with overall and disease-free survival (51). Activation
of PI3K-AKT signaling is downstream of several biological
processes involved in OS metastasis, such as c-Met and Ezrin
expression (52, 53). Micro-RNA-221, expressed at high levels in
OS targets PTEN, increases cell survival, decreases apoptosis,
and induces cisplatin resistance (54). These alternative mecha-
nisms of PI3K/mTOR pathway activation in OS may explain the
universal sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors observed in hu-
man osteosarcoma cell lines. In agreement with our data, the
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 and the α-selective PI3K
inhibitor BYL719 have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest
and decrease tumor formation in vivo (36, 55). In addition, in
preclinical models, mTOR inhibition potentiates the effect of
bisphosphonates and sorafenib, drugs being studied in clinical
trials in OS (56–58). Other studies have focused on one gene or
small molecule but this work demonstrates the convergence of
multiple different approaches in human and mouse on the PI3K/
mTOR pathway as a whole. In using an unbiased screen and
comprehensive genomic assessment, we strengthen the existing
evidence regarding a role for the PI3K/mTOR pathway in OS.
Prior clinical studies of mTOR inhibition in sarcomas and our
identification of a range of alterations in the PI3K/mTOR path-
way serves as a basis for rational clinical trial design. In a phase II
trial of ridaforolimus, a second-generation mTOR inhibitor, two
patients with OS had confirmed partial responses and one patient
with OS had an unconfirmed partial response. The number of OS
patients enrolled in this phase II trial is not reported (54 bone
tumor patients were enrolled) and so a response rate cannot be
determined (59). Given the promising results seen with mTOR
inhibition in tuberous sclerosis-associated subependymal giant-
cell astrocytomas and renal angiomyolipoma, one could hypoth-
esize that the two patients with partial responses had tumors
harboring TSC2 mutations (60, 61). In a follow-up phase III
study, ridaforolimus was administered as maintenance therapy
to patients with advanced sarcomas. Only 69 of the 711 patients
enrolled in this phase III trial had bone tumors and conse-
quently, the subgroup analysis of bone tumors does not achieve
statistical significance (62). To ensure adequate enrollment of
OS patients, future clinical trials of PI3K/mTOR inhibition
should be limited to OS patients. Given the frequency and range
of PI3K/mTOR pathway alterations identified in this study,
patient’s tumors should be genotyped and activity of the PI3K/
mTOR pathway assessed by additional methods so that clinical
responses can be correlated with genotype and pathway activity.
Materials and Methods
Sample Selection and Clinical Data. Samples were contributed by hospitals in
Brazil, Spain, Mexico, and the United States. All patients had histopa-
thology confirmed to be OS by a pathologist at the local institution. All
patients had consented to protocols approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the appropriate institution. All but five tumor specimens se-
quenced were obtained prechemotherapy from the primary tumor at the
time of diagnosis. Two tumor specimens were obtained prechemotherapy
from a metastatic tumor at the time of diagnosis. Three tumor specimens
were obtained postchemotherapy from a metastatic tumor (SJ02, SJ13,
DF01). Survival curves were compared using a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.
Patients who died from treatment toxicity were censored at the time
of death.

GISTIC2 score for the gene was positive, 2 or 1 (Dataset S14). Both WGS and
RNASeq data were examined for evidence of TP53 or RB1 rearrangements.
Murine Osteosarcoma. Murine OS spontaneously arising in a mouse model
based on conditional deletion of Tp53 and Rb1 restricted to the preosteo-
blast were obtained by killing the animal once a visible tumor causing
symptoms was present (32). Tumors were dissected free of normal tissue and
frozen at −80 °C. Murine OS cell lines were derived by mincing fresh tumors
and culturing in αMEM.
shRNA Constructs and Lentivirus. Lentiviral shRNAs were obtained from The
RNAi Consortium (TRC) collection of the Broad Institute (www.broad-
institute.org/rnai/public). shRNAs were expressed from the lentiviral ex-
pression plasmid pLKO.1. Virus was produced as previously described (63,
64). The TRC numbers for the shRNAs used in the in vitro and in vivo pooled
shRNA screens are listed in Datasets S10 and S15, respectively. For individual
testing of shRNAs, the TRC numbers are: Luciferase, TRCN0000072261;
Pik3ca, TRCN0000025615; Pik3cb, TRCN0000024792. Detailed methods
for in vitro and in vivo screening and analysis are provided in SI Materials
and Methods.
PI3K/mTOR Inhibitor Studies. All inhibitors used in this study were purchased
from Selleck Chemicals. Human OS cell lines were obtained from ATCC.
Human OS cell lines were cultured with drug or DMSO control for 24 h and
viability was assessed with the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay
(Promega). Murine OS cell lines were cultured with drug or control for 72 h
and viability was assessed with the cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche).
Caspase 3/7 activation after 16 h of treatment with inhibitors was determined
with the Caspase-Glo 3/7 luminescence assay (Promega). For Western blot
analysis, human OS cell lines were treated with inhibitors for 4 h; murine OS
cell lines were treated for 24 h. Western blotting was performed as previously
described (65). All primary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling.
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories.
