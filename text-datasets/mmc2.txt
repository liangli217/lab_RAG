SUMMARY
Acquired chromosomal instability and copy number
alterations
are
hallmarks
of
cancer.
Enzymes
capable of promoting site-speciﬁc copy number
changes
have
yet
to
be
identiﬁed.
Here,
we
demonstrate that H3K9/36me3 lysine demethylase
KDM4A/JMJD2A overexpression leads to localized
copy gain of 1q12, 1q21, and Xq13.1 without global
chromosome instability. KDM4A-ampliﬁed tumors
have increased copy gains for these same regions.
1q12h copy gain occurs within a single cell cycle,
requires S phase, and is not stable but is regenerated
each cell division. Sites with increased copy number
are rereplicated and have increased KDM4A, MCM,
and DNA polymerase occupancy. Suv39h1/KMT1A
or HP1g overexpression suppresses the copy gain,
whereas H3K9/K36 methylation interference pro-
motes gain. Our results demonstrate that overex-
pression of a chromatin modiﬁer results in site-spe-
ciﬁc copy gains. This begins to establish how copy
number changes could originate during tumorigen-
esis and demonstrates that transient overexpression
of speciﬁc chromatin modulators could promote
these events.
INTRODUCTION
Genomic instability is a major contributing factor to the develop-
ment and onset of age-related diseases such as cancer (Maslov
and Vijg, 2009; Negrini et al., 2010). Cancer cells are often char-
acterized by copy number alterations: gains or losses of chromo-
some arms and/or whole chromosomes as well as ampliﬁcations
of smaller genomic fragments (Beroukhim et al., 2010; Hook
et al., 2007; Stratton et al., 2009). Genome-wide analysis of
copy number changes in cancer has identiﬁed chromosomal re-
gions with higher frequencies of ampliﬁcation, which often
contain putative oncogenes (Beroukhim et al., 2010). In some
cases, the oncogenes have been shown to impact cellular
behavior (e.g., MYC and MCL1), whereas other genes within
these regions do not have clear connections with tumorigenesis.
The lack of obvious connection does not preclude the gene’s
involvement. For example, cellular stresses can select for gene
ampliﬁcation that will promote cancer cell survival, as exempli-
ﬁed by the ampliﬁcation of dihydrofolate reductase when cells
are treated with methotrexate (Schimke, 1984). Even though
cancer genomes frequently have altered chromosomal regions,
there is little knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms or fac-
tors that are involved in promoting copy number alterations at
speciﬁc regions of the genome.
Several mechanisms have been proposed for generating copy
number variation (CNV). For example, many models for DNA
ampliﬁcation incorporate stalled replication forks and DNA
double-strand breaks that are generated during replication. It
has been proposed that these stalled/collapsed replication
forks are associated with and can cause tandem duplications.
A second mechanism proposed to contribute to CNV involves
the use of breaks or repair intermediates as primers for rereplica-
tion of speciﬁc stretches of DNA, which can reincorporate into
the genome, resulting in gene duplications or deletions. Alterna-
tively, it is also possible that these events will not integrate in the
genome (Hastings et al., 2009). A third mechanism that could
generate rereplicated fragments and copy number alteration is
the head-to-tail collision of elongating DNA polymerases (David-
son et al., 2006; Hook et al., 2007). Because chromatin structure
impacts replication initiation and elongation efﬁciency as well as

DNA damage response and repair (Alabert and Groth, 2012;
Papamichos-Chronakis and Peterson, 2013), the chromatin
state or modifying enzyme(s) could have a signiﬁcant impact
on each of these possible mechanisms.
Recently, Kiang and colleagues demonstrated that local DNA
fragment ampliﬁcation occurs during S phase (Kiang et al., 2010)
and that the chromatin context or chromosome microenviron-
ments play a major role in this process. Consistent with an impor-
tant role for the chromatin context, misregulation of the histone 4
lysine 20 monomethyltransferase KMT5A (H4K20me1, PR-Set7/
Set8) promotes rereplication, at least in part, by increasing
H4K20me2/3 levels and promoting ORC recruitment through
binding of H4K20me2 (Beck et al., 2012; Kuo et al., 2012; Tardat
et al., 2010). However, the role of methylation in modulating repli-
cation is not limited to the direct recruitment of DNA replication
factors. For example, we have previously demonstrated that
the H3K9me3 demethylase KDM4A/JMJD2A was able to in-
crease accessibility and alter the replication timing at speciﬁc
heterochromatic regions (Black et al., 2010). The regulation of
KDM4A protein levels is also important in modulating its chro-
matin occupancy, replication initiation, and S-phase progression
(Van Rechem et al., 2011). Furthermore, Mallette and colleagues
demonstrate that increased KDM4A expression abrogates
53BP1 recruitment to DNA damage sites, suggesting a role for
KDM4A in DNA damage response (Mallette et al., 2012). There-
fore, we hypothesize that overexpression of catalytically active
KDM4A may provide a potential enzymatic link to the proposed
methods for generating copy number alterations through replica-
tion abnormalities, which may contribute to copy number
changes in cancer.
In this study, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
data and observed that KDM4A is ampliﬁed and overexpressed
in several tumor types. KDM4A overexpression in transgenic
cells was sufﬁcient to promote copy gain of speciﬁc chromo-
somal domains (e.g., 1q12). KDM4A-dependent copy gain
was induced in less than 24 hr and required S phase. These
copy gains were not stably inherited but were generated tran-
siently in each subsequent S phase and cleared by late G2.
KDM4A was the only KDM4 family member that generated the
gains in a catalytically dependent manner. These copy gains
were antagonized by coexpression of Suv39h1/KMT1A or
HP1g, and H3K9 or H3K36 methylation interference promoted
gain. Furthermore, KDM4A associated with replication machin-
ery and promoted rereplication of regions exhibiting copy gain.
KDM4A overexpression increased KDM4A, MCM, and DNA po-
lymerase association as well as decreased HP1g occupancy at
regions that undergo KDM4A-dependent rereplication. Interest-
ingly, focal ampliﬁcations of 1q21 and Xq13.1 were correlated
with KDM4A ampliﬁcation in tumors, which was recapitulated
in KDM4A-overexpressing cell lines. Our ﬁndings demonstrate
that KDM4A overexpression results in site-speciﬁc copy gain
of regions ampliﬁed in human tumors.
RESULTS
KDM4A Is Ampliﬁed and Overexpressed in Cancer
KDM4A has previously been demonstrated to be overexpressed
in breast and lung cancer (Berry et al., 2012; Mallette and
Richard, 2012). However, a comprehensive proﬁle of primary
tumors for alterations in KDM4A expression levels has yet to be
established. There are few insights into the mechanisms that
promote increased expression in tumors. Therefore, we conduct-
ed a comprehensive analysis of KDM4A copy number and ex-
pression level in 1,770 primary tumor samples from eight different
cancer types (Figure S1 available online) represented in TCGA
(Beroukhim et al., 2010). We found evidence of increased
KDM4A copy number (GISTIC annotation of +1 or +2; Mermel
et al., 2011) in 18.9% of tumors (335 out of 1,770 samples;
Figure 1A) and copy loss in 22.1% of tumors (392 out of 1,770
samples; Figure 1A). Furthermore, ampliﬁcation or deletion of
KDM4A resulted in increased or decreased KDM4A expression,
respectively (Figures 1B and Figure S1A). KDM4A was both
ampliﬁed and deleted across many disparate cancer types, and
KDM4A expression correlated with copy number in these sam-
ples (Figures S1E–S1L). We also observed ampliﬁcation and
deletion of KDM4B-D in cancer, which correlated with expression
(Figures S1B–S1D). These data provide a molecular basis for the
elevated KDM4A levels observed in different tumor samples.
Ovarian cancer was signiﬁcantly enriched for KDM4A ampliﬁ-
cation, which was ampliﬁed in 46% of the tumors (94 out of 204,
p = 1.4 3 1021 for gain versus no change and loss by Fisher’s
exact test), with relatively few examples of deletion (9.8%; 20
out of 204, samples) (Figures 1C and S1I). The ampliﬁcation of
KDM4A in ovarian cancer also correlated with increased expres-
sion (Figures 1D and S1I). In addition, KDM4A focal ampliﬁcation
(GISTIC +2) was signiﬁcantly associated with the time to death in
the ovarian cancer patient data set, with a median time to death
of 691 days compared to 1,052 days without KDM4A ampliﬁca-
tion (Figure 1E, p = 0.02); however, KDM4A loss (GISTIC 2 or
1) was not signiﬁcantly different from patients without changes
in KDM4A copy number (p = 0.85). In sharp contrast to KDM4A,
few cases of focal ampliﬁcations were observed for KDM4B-D,
and no statistical signiﬁcance was associated with their focal
ampliﬁcations and time to death (Figures 1F–1H). However, focal
deletion of KDM4C (GISTIC 2) and broad loss or gain (GISTIC
1 or +1) of KDM4D modestly associated with poor outcome
(p = 0.014, p = 0.013, and p = 0.018, respectively). These data
highlight the differences between the KDM4 family and cancer
outcome, which suggests nonoverlapping functions in certain
cancer types. These data also suggest that KDM4A levels could
function as a biomarker in ovarian cancer.
KDM4A Overexpression Promotes Copy Gain of 1q12
We previously
demonstrated
that
KDM4A overexpression
promoted faster S-phase progression, increased chromatin
accessibility, and altered replication timing (Black et al., 2010).
KDM4A was also shown to impact the DNA damage response
(Mallette et al., 2012). For these reasons, we hypothesized that
KDM4A overexpression may promote genomic instability, which
is a hallmark of cancer (Luo et al., 2009; Hanahan and Weinberg,
2011). Therefore, we stably overexpressed KDM4A in the
karyotypically stable and immortalized, but not transformed,
RPE1-hTERT (RPE) cell line (GFP, referred to as control or
CTRL; GFP-KDM4A, referred to as KDM4A) (Jiang et al., 1999).
Similar to our previously reported 293T stable cells (Figure S2A),
RPE stable cell lines expressed KDM4A about 2- to 3-fold over
542

endogenous level (Figure S2B). Upon spectral karyotyping these
cell lines, we did not observe major genomic events that were
speciﬁc to the KDM4A cell lines when compared to CTRL cell
lines (SKY; Figures 2A and 2B and Table S1). Similarly, G-band
analysis of a 293T KDM4A-overexpressing stable cell line did
not document any ampliﬁcation, deletion, or translocation spe-
ciﬁc to GFP-KDM4A cells (data not shown). These data support
the notion that modest KDM4A overexpression does not pro-
mote large-scale genomic instability.
We reasoned that KDM4A might promote instability at speciﬁc
genomic loci that could be below the detection threshold of SKY.
In order to identify these candidate regions, we reanalyzed our
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip analysis of
KDM4A binding in 293T cells (Figure S2C) (Van Rechem et al.,
2011) for KDM4A enrichment by cytogenetic band. Of the top
ten enriched cytogenetic bands, only 1q12 was speciﬁcally en-
riched in KDM4A-overexpressing cells when compared to con-
trol cells (Figure S2C). 1q12/21 is a region with frequent CNV in
lung cancer, multiple myeloma, and congenital heart abnormal-
ities and has been described as a susceptibility locus for schizo-
phrenia and autism (Brunet et al., 2009; Brzustowicz et al., 2000;
Inoue et al., 2004; Yakut et al., 2006). To determine whether the
copy number of 1q12 was altered following manipulation of
KDM4A protein levels, we performed ﬂuorescent in situ hybridi-
zation (FISH) in CTRL and KDM4A-overexpressing 293T cells
(Figures 2C–2K and S2D). KDM4A overexpression resulted in
increased copy number of 1q12h in 14% of cells (Figure 2K),
which was not due to a gain of the entire 1q chromosome arm,
as the 1q telomere did not have an increase in copy number (Fig-
ure 2K; 1qTel). Furthermore, no other gains occurred at addi-
tional pericentric regions (Figure 2K). We further validated these
results in the RPE stable cell lines used in the SKY analysis (Fig-
ures 2A, 2B, S2B). Similar to the 293T cells, 17% of KDM4A-
overexpressing RPE cells showed an increase in copy of
1q12h, whereas no signiﬁcant changes in copy number were
observed for the 1q telomere or other centromeres on chromo-
somes 2, 6, 8, or X (Figures 2L–2T; Chr 2, 6, 8, X).
To eliminate the possibility that KDM4A promoted chromatin
accessibility so that there was increased 1q12h detection, con-
densin 1 (CapD2) or condensin 2 (CapD3) were depleted from
cells (Figure S2F). Depletion of either condensin did not increase
detection of 1q12h ampliﬁcation in CTRL or KDM4A cells (Fig-
ure S2G). Therefore, the increased copy number of 1q12h in
KDM4A cells is most likely not an artifact of increased chromatin
accessibility. Furthermore, 1q12h copy gain was not due to alter-
ations in p53 activity, as doxorubicin treatment resulted in p53
stabilization and target gene activation in CTRL and KDM4A cells
(Figures S2H and S2I).
KDM4A-Dependent 1q12h Copy Gain Is Dose
Dependent and Requires Catalytic Activity and Tudor
Domains
In order to determine whether the expression level and catalytic
activity of KDM4A are required for 1q12h copy gain, we overex-
pressed catalytically active and inactive KDM4A (H188A; Whets-
tine et al., 2006) with and without KDM4A depletion by shRNA
(Figures 3A and S3A). Transient overexpression of KDM4A was
sufﬁcient to promote 1q12h copy gain but not alter copy number
of Chr 8. However, concomitant depletion of KDM4A sup-
pressed 1q12h gain, which demonstrates the importance of
increasing KDM4A levels in order to observe 1q12h gain (Figures
3A and S3A). Importantly, neither catalytically dead KDM4A

overexpression (Figures 3A and 3B; H188A) nor KDM4A deple-
tion promoted 1q12h copy gain, which emphasizes that the
gain
is
not

dominant-negative
effect
due
to
KDM4A
overexpression.
We further demonstrated that 1q12h gain occurred in less than
24 hr of KDM4A transient overexpression in RPE cells (Figures
3C, 3D, S3B, and S3C) while not altering copy gain at other re-
gions (Figure 3D). Interestingly, KDM4B, KDM4C, or KDM4D
overexpression for 24 hr did not alter 1q12h copy number (Fig-
ures 3E and S3C). The copy gain required KDM4A catalytic ac-
tivity (H188A) and enzymatic domains (JmjC and JmjN; referred
to as DNC) in RPE cells (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3B). However, the
KDM4A catalytic domain alone was insufﬁcient to generate
1q12h gain (Figures 3B and 3C; referred to as NC). Interestingly,
the loss of the Tudor domains alone was sufﬁcient to block the
1q12h gain (Figures 3B and 3C; referred to as NCMP). Taken

together, these data emphasize that transient exposure to
increased KDM4A levels is sufﬁcient to promote 1q12h copy
gain, but this can only occur with a catalytically active enzyme
and functional Tudor domains.
Interfering with H3K9 or H3K36 Methylation Promotes
1q12 Copy Gain
The requirement for KDM4A catalytic activity to promote 1q12
copy gain suggests that demethylation of chromatin or a nonhis-
tone target is important for proper regulation of 1q12h ploidy.
Recently, Lewis and colleagues demonstrated that H3.3 variants
with a methionine in place of the lysine (i.e., H3K27M, H3K9M,
and H3K36M) can inhibit EZH2 (K27M), G9a (K9M), and
Suv39h1 (K9M), as well as reduce H3K36me3 levels (K36M)
(Lewis et al., 2013). Therefore, these H3.3 variants were used
to ascertain whether interfering with methylation at any one of
these lysines could promote 1q12h copy gain. Each variant
was expressed and successfully incorporated into chromatin in
24 hr and reduced the corresponding trimethylation (Figures
S3D and S3E). Expression of H3.3 WT, G34V, and H3K27M failed
to promote 1q12h copy gain; however, expression of either
H3.3K9M or H3.3K36M was sufﬁcient to promote 1q12h gain
(Figure 3F; p = 0.026 for K9M and p = 0.006 for K36M). Further-

more, the 1q12h gain was not caused by
a gain of chromosome 1, as there was not
an increase in 1q Tel or in the 1q23.3 cy-
togenetic band midway down the 1q arm
(Figure 3F). Because H3.3K9M promoted
copy gain at 1q12h and inhibits Suv39h1
(Lewis et al., 2013), we reasoned that overexpression of the
H3K9me3 methyltransferase Suv39h1 may suppress KDM4A-
dependent copy gain. Consistent with this prediction, coexpres-
sion of Halo-Suv39h1 was sufﬁcient to abrogate KDM4A-depen-
dent 1q12h copy gain (p = 0.0003 for KDM4A vs NHF; p = 0.0055
for KDM4A + Suv39h1 vs KDM4A; and p = 0.47 for KDM4A+
Suv39h1 vs NHF) (Figures 3G and S3F). These results highlight
the importance of methylation in modulating site-speciﬁc copy
gain, especially the lysines that are substrates for KDM4A.
HP1g Antagonizes KDM4A-Dependent Increased 1q12
Copy Number
KDM4A-dependent changes in cell-cycle progression and
replication timing at Chr1 sat2 are antagonized by HP1g over-
expression (Black et al., 2010). Therefore, we hypothesized that
HP1g overexpression could antagonize the increased copy
number of 1q12 in KDM4A-overexpressing cells. Cotransfection
of HP1g reduced the 1q12h copy gain to levels comparable
to that seen in control cells (p = 0.29 for KDM4A + HP1g vs
GFP-CTRL+ HP1g; and p = 0.009 for KDM4A + HP1g vs
KDM4A + RFP-CTRL) (Figures 3H and S3G). Surprisingly, trans-
fection of HP1g into RPE cells stably overexpressing KDM4A
or stably co-overexpressing HP1g and KDM4A did not reverse

545

the increased copy number of 1q12h (data not shown). These
results imply that, once an altered chromatin conformation is
established, HP1g is insufﬁcient to restore proper regulation of
1q12 copy number in KDM4A overexpressing cells.
1q12 Copy Gain Is Not Stably Inherited and Requires
S Phase
Because KDM4A overexpression promotes 1q12 gain, we asked
whether the increased copy number was stably inherited or was
regenerated during subsequent cell cycles. First, single-cell
clones
were
established
from
our
stably
overexpressing
KDM4A RPE cell line and were assayed by 1q12h FISH (Fig-
ure 4A). If the copy number of 1q12h was stably inherited,
some clones should have 100% of cells with 1q12h copy gain.
Instead, we observed a distribution of copy gain between 1.5%
and 37%, which supports the model that 1q12 gain is most likely
not stably inherited (Figures 4A and S4A). The clones lacking
increased copy of 1q12h (below black dashed line) no longer
overexpressed KDM4A (Figure S4A). Furthermore, the average
of all clones assayed was 17.0%, agreeing with our analysis of
the starting stable population (Figures 4B and 2T, respectively).
We next investigated whether stably overexpressing KDM4A
RPE cells gain extra copies of 1q12h during each cell division.
The 1q12h copy gain was eliminated in KDM4A overexpressing
RPE cells arrested in G1/S with HU (Figures 4C and S4B).
Because apoptosis was not increased in asynchronous or HU-
arrested KDM4A cells, the lack of copy gain was not due to

induce
apoptosis in both CTRL and KDM4A
cells, which was signiﬁcantly reduced
in KDM4A-overexpressing cells (Figure
S4C). We then tested whether 1q12h
gain persisted through G2 by arresting
cells in late G2 with the CDK1 inhibitor
R03306 (Figure S4B; Vassilev, 2006). KDM4A cells arrested in
late G2 and did not display 1q12h copy gain (Figure 4D).
Given that KDM4A-dependent 1q12h copy gain did not
occur during G1/S or G2 arrest, we hypothesized that KDM4A
promotes copy gain during S phase. In agreement with this
hypothesis, GFP-KDM4A cells, but not GFP-CTRL cells, were
able to promote additional copies of 1q12h, but not Chr 8 cen-
tromere following HU release (Figures 4E and 4F). The additional
copies occurred between 2 and 6 hr post-HU release and were
lost between 8 and 10 hr following release. Taken together, our
data support a model whereby KDM4A promotes copy gain of
speciﬁc chromosomal regions during S phase, which are then
eliminated by the end of the G2 phase of cell cycle.
KDM4A Associates with Replication Machinery and
Promotes Rereplication of 1q12
In order to gain molecular insight into how KDM4A is involved in
generating 1q12h copy gain, we identiﬁed KDM4A-interacting
proteins by performing mass spectrometry analysis of proteins
interacting with Halo-KDM4A. We observed a signiﬁcant enrich-
ment for proteins involved in replication using IPA (Figure 5A; p =
0.00000795). Interestingly, many of these proteins are required
for rereplication (e.g., MCMs and DNA polymerases; Arias and
Walter, 2007; Snaith and Forsburg, 1999).
Previous work veriﬁed KDM4A associations with cullin 1 (Van
Rechem et al., 2011) and p53 (Kim et al., 2012). We further vali-

KDM4A coimmunoprecipitation with MCM2, MCM3, and MCM7
or Halo-tagged DNA polymerase subunits (Figures 5B and S5A).
Although MCM2 was not identiﬁed in our mass spectrometry
analysis, it associated with KDM4A, suggesting that the entire
MCM complex interacts with KDM4A.
Because KDM4A overexpression promoted copy gain in a
replication-dependent manner and interacted with DNA poly-
merases and the replication licensing machinery, we hypothe-
sized that KDM4A overexpression was promoting rereplication
within 1q12. To test this hypothesis, we utilized cesium chloride
density gradient centrifugation (Figure S5B). Our labeling proce-
dure was performed for less than one complete cell cycle, pro-
ducing an enrichment in heavy-light (H:L)-replicated DNA while
still maintaining an unreplicated light-light fraction (L:L). We did
not detect a peak of enrichment of H:H DNA, indicating that
KDM4A overexpression does not promote widespread rerepli-
cation, as seen with other chromatin regulators (KMT5A; Tardat
et al., 2010). We pooled and puriﬁed the fractions in which the
H:H DNA should separate and then assayed the rereplicated
DNA for speciﬁc regions. Because Chr1 sat2 resides in 1q12
(Wong et al., 2001) and is bound and modulated by KDM4A,
we reasoned that it could be a rereplicated target. We observed
a 7-fold enrichment of Chr1 sat2 in the rereplicated fraction from
KDM4A-overexpressing cells, whereas the b-actin locus and a
region near the X centromere, which we previously reported as
a KDM4A target (Black et al., 2010), were not enriched (Figures

5C and S5C). The enrichment in Chr1 sat2 rereplication repre-
sented a small amount of the input DNA and was consistent
with a subpopulation of cells generating and losing the 1q12h
copy gain (Figure S5C). Taken together, our data demonstrate
that KDM4A associates with replication proteins and promotes
rereplication at a speciﬁc locus that exhibits copy gains.
KDM4A Overexpression Promotes Chromatin State
Changes and Recruitment of Replication Machinery
Our data support a model whereby KDM4A overexpression
promotes methylation changes, displacement of HP1g, and
recruitment of replication machinery to speciﬁc genomic re-
gions, resulting in rereplication. To test this model, we performed
ChIP experiments to evaluate methylation levels, HP1g enrich-
ment, and replication machinery occupancy at Chr1 sat2. As a
negative control, we identiﬁed an intergenic region on chromo-
some 10 (Chr10) that is acetylated at H3K9 in numerous cell
types (according to UCSC browser; data not shown) that should
not be enriched for H3K9me3 or KDM4A. KDM4A overexpres-
sion increased KDM4A recruitment to Chr1 sat2, but not Chr10
(Figure 5D), which corresponded to a loss of H3K9me3 and
HP1g depletion (Figures 5E and 5F). We did not observe any
change in H3K36me3 at Chr1 sat2, which was consistent with
our previous ﬁndings in 293T cells (Black et al., 2010). Finally,
both MCM7 and Pola were enriched at Chr1 sat2, but not at
Chr10, upon KDM4A overexpression (Figures 5G and 5H,
respectively). Our data demonstrate that KDM4A overexpres-
sion promotes H3K9me3 and HP1g loss, increased replication
machinery recruitment, and rereplication.
Identiﬁcation of Regions Coampliﬁed with KDM4A in
Cancer
To identify additional regions that have copy gains upon KDM4A
overexpression, we determined whether KDM4A focal ampliﬁca-
tion (1p34.2) in primary tumors was correlated with copy gains of
any of the 807 cytogenetic bands in 4,420 tumor samples (Fig-
ure 6A, which represents 19 tumor types, including the 8
analyzed in Figure S1). We observed correlated copy gains
from 1p11.2 through 1q21.3 on chromosome 1 in two indepen-
dent statistical tests (Figures 6A and S6A, blue shading; see
Experimental Procedures). Due to the minimal sequence annota-
tion and repetitive nature of 1q12, we did not calculate a corre-
lation for this cytogenetic band. However, the cytogenetic bands
immediately ﬂanking 1q12 (1p11.2 and 1q21.1) exhibited co-
gain with KDM4A ampliﬁcation, which suggests that 1q12 is
likely coampliﬁed in these tumors. These coampliﬁed regions
were speciﬁc to KDM4A because there was not a strong cor-
relation when the identical analysis was performed with respect
to KDM4B coampliﬁcation (Figures 6B and S6B). We ob-
served that individual coampliﬁed regions could universally be
observed, whereas others could be differentially regulated in
a tumor- and/or tissue-speciﬁc manner. For example, the
ovarian cancer data sets demonstrated coampliﬁcation with
1p11.2-1q21.3, whereas some KDM4A-coampliﬁed regions
were lost (e.g., the region on 17q positions 17q24.2 to
17q25.3) and others were enhanced (e.g., the region on X chro-
mosome positions Xp11.2 to Xq13.2) in the ovarian cancer pro-
ﬁle (Figures 6C and S6C).
Next, we tested whether gains in 1q21.1-1q21.3 were affected
by the ampliﬁcation level of KDM4A (Figures 6D–6F and S6D–
S6F). Indeed, when KDM4A had a high-level focal ampliﬁcation
(GISTIC +2), a signiﬁcantly greater fraction of samples were
ampliﬁed in 1q21.1-1q21.3 compared to cases in which KDM4A
was not ampliﬁed (GISTIC 0; Fisher’s exact test; p = 2 3 109
in 1q21.1, 1.9 3 109 in 1q21.2, and 1.02 3 1010 in 1q21.3)
(Figures 6D–6F). When comparing lower-level ampliﬁcation of
KDM4A (GISTIC +1) to the KDM4A-unampliﬁed cases, we
observed a reduced sample fraction but still highly signiﬁcant
ampliﬁcation of 1q21.1-1q21.3 (p = 2.04 3 1025 in 1q21.1,
6.28 3 1022 in 1q21.2, and 3 3 1024 in 1q21.3). In contrast,
when stratifying the samples based on KDM4B ampliﬁcation
status (Figures 6G–6I and S6G–S6I), the differences are not sig-
niﬁcant (all p values > 0.1 by Fisher’s exact test), although a
minimal trend in the same direction is observed. These results
demonstrate that KDM4A ampliﬁcation in tumors correlated
with ampliﬁcation of speciﬁc cytogenetic bands, which suggests
that KDM4A may promote site-speciﬁc copy gains in vivo.
Copy Gain and Rereplication Occur in Regions
Coampliﬁed in Tumors
Because 1q21.1-1q21.3 ampliﬁcation correlated with KDM4A
ampliﬁcation, we assessed whether these regions were gained
by FISH and rereplicated by density gradient centrifugation in
transgenic cell lines. We observed increased copy number of
1q12 through 1q21.2 in our KDM4A-overexpressing cells, but
not in control cells (Figures 7A and 7B). Our coampliﬁcation

analysis of all tumors indicated that the correlation with KDM4A
copy number diminished at 1q23.3, suggesting that 1q23.3 is not
ampliﬁed in KDM4A-overexpressing cells, which was in fact the
case in KDM4A-overexpressing RPE cells (Figures 7A and 7B).
We then evaluated copy gain of other chromosomal domains
identiﬁed through our coampliﬁcation analysis. We chose to
examine the small focal peak on the X chromosome (Xp11.2-
Xq13.2), which was speciﬁc to coampliﬁcation with KDM4A
across all cancers and was even more enriched in ovarian cancer
(Figures 6A and 6C, respectively). KDM4A-overexpressing RPE
cells exhibited Xq13.1 copy gains, but not the X centromere or
Xq13.2 (Figures 7C and 7D). Xq13.1 as well as 1q12/21 and
1q21.2 copy gains were also observed in 293T cells overex-
pressing KDM4A (Figure S6J). These data demonstrate that
KDM4A-coampliﬁed regions in primary tumors are generated
by KDM4A overexpression in transgenic cell lines.
The coampliﬁcation analysis of tumor data sets does not
distinguish whether the entire intervening sequence between
1q12h and 1q21.3 was ampliﬁed in the same tumor cells. There-
fore, we scored the 1q12/21 or 1q21.2 FISH probes with the
1q12h probe in the same KDM4A-overexpressing cells (Figures
7A and 7E–7U). We observed that approximately two-thirds of
the KDM4A-overexpressing cells with 1q12h ampliﬁcation also
had 1q12/21.1 ampliﬁcation, whereas approximately one-third
had only 1q12/21.1 copy gain but lacked 1q12h gain (Figure 7U).
In the case of 1q12h or 1q21.2 ampliﬁcation, the majority of cells
had gains in one or the other cytogenetic band (Figures 7M–7U).
Taken together, these data demonstrate that the entire region
between 1q12h and 1q21.3 is not contiguously ampliﬁed but
that KDM4A is directing copy gain within these cytogenetic
bands. The ability to detect nonoverlapping foci also suggests
that the additional copies may exist as extrachromosomal
pieces. This possibility was further supported by the fact that
1q12/21 FISH marked the additional 1q12/21 copy adjacent to
or physically distinct from the chromosome 1 painted territory
(Figures S7A–S7L).
To address whether these gained regions were through rere-
plication, we assayed our CsCl gradient H:H fraction for regions
under our FISH probes in the indicated cytogenetic bands (Fig-
ure 7V). We observed rereplication at 1q12h (indicated by Chr1
sat2), 1q12/21.1, 1q21.2, and 1q21.3, but not in 1q23.3 or on
Chr10. Rereplication was detected inside Xq13.1, but not near
the X centromere. In addition, the rereplicated regions were
bound by KDM4A, which was further enriched upon KDM4A
overexpression (Figures 7W and S6K). As with Chr1 sat2,
KDM4A overexpression promoted loss of HP1g (Figure 7X) and
recruitment of MCM7 and Pola to 1q21.2 and Xq13.1 (Figures
7Y and 7Z, respectively). Taken together, our data are consistent
with the model that KDM4A overexpression promotes copy gain
and rereplication at speciﬁc sites within the genome in vivo (tu-
mors) and in vitro (transgenic cell lines).
DISCUSSION
Genomic instability is a major contributing factor to the develop-
ment and onset of age-related diseases. Cancer cells often
contain alterations in copy number of genes, speciﬁc genomic
regions, chromosome arms, and entire chromosomes. However,
the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to these copy
number alterations are poorly understood. Here, we report that
overexpression
of a single
chromatin
modifying
enzyme,
KDM4A, is sufﬁcient to promote rereplication and copy gain of
speciﬁc chromosomal domains. Furthermore, KDM4A-depen-
dent ampliﬁed regions are found coampliﬁed with KDM4A in pri-
mary tumors. Our results support a model in which increased
expression of KDM4A promotes recruitment of KDM4A to spe-
ciﬁc genomic regions and promotes rereplication (Figure S7M).
KDM4 Members and Cancer
Our results demonstrate that KDM4A is ampliﬁed in different
tumor types and correlates with increased KDM4A expression.
Intriguingly, when compared to other tumor types, ovarian can-
cer is enriched for ampliﬁcations of KDM4A, which correlate
with poor outcome in these cases. Levels of KDM4A may there-
fore represent a good biomarker for ovarian cancer, especially
with respect to novel therapies that target this lysine demethy-
lase. In addition, ovarian patients with increased levels of
KDM4A may respond more poorly to S-phase chemotherapeu-
tics, as KDM4A overexpression resulted in better recovery
from HU (Black et al., 2010). Consistent with this possibility,
ovarian cell lines with 1q12-21 ampliﬁcation are often more resis-
tant to cisplatin treatment (Kudoh et al., 1999; Takano et al.,
2001). Interestingly, drug resistance in multiple myeloma is
also associated with 1q12-21 ampliﬁcation (Inoue et al., 2004).
Addressing the relationship between KDM4A, 1q12-21 coampli-
ﬁcation, and drug responses will be important in future studies.

Even though KDM4 family members have a high degree of
homology, they have different distribution of genomic anomalies
in cancer. We observed focal deletions in KDM4B-D, whereas
none were observed in KDM4A across the eight different tumor
types (Figures S1A–S1D). We also found that KDM4A was the
only family member that had a correlation between focal ampli-
ﬁcation and poor outcome for ovarian cancer patients. Thus, it
is intriguing to speculate that KDM4 family enzymes may play
different roles in ovarian cancer and other tumor types. Overall,
our data highlight the idea that these family members are not
created equal but, most likely, have their own speciﬁc roles in
cancer and in other diseases.
Chromatin Environment and KDM4A-Dependent
Copy Gain
Work in yeast demonstrates that speciﬁc genomic regions can
generate extra DNA fragments in S phase, which depends on
the chromatin environment (Kiang et al., 2010). These observa-
tions are consistent with our KDM4A-dependent rereplication
of speciﬁc chromosomal regions. These regions are enriched
for KDM4A binding upon overexpression of KDM4A, rereplicate,
and have increased copy number during S phase. Interestingly,
not all KDM4A-occupied sites are rereplicating in the cell lines
tested (Figure 7V). However, this could reﬂect the chromatin
environment in these particular cells or distinct chromatin states
inﬂuenced by other chromatin modiﬁers. This would be consis-
tent with our ability to see Xq13.1 and X centromere copy gain
in KDM4A focally ampliﬁed tumors while only seeing the copy
gain and rereplication of Xq13.1 in our transgenic cell lines.
Thus,
different
genomic
regions
may
be
susceptible
to
KDM4A-dependent rereplication in speciﬁc tissue types.
Consistent with the model that chromatin state impacts copy
gain, we demonstrated that interfering with H3K9 or K36 methyl-
ation resulted in the site-speciﬁc gain of 1q12h in 24 hr, whereas
overexpression of Suv39h1 or HP1g was able to suppress the
1q12h gain. Surprisingly, we were unable to reverse KDM4A-
dependent copy gains in cells stably overexpressing KDM4A
by overexpressing HP1g even though these copy gains are re-
generated each cell cycle. This observation supports a model
whereby KDM4A may establish a chromatin state that promotes
rereplication and increased copy number of speciﬁc chromo-
somal regions. Formation of this chromatin state could be antag-
onized by HP1g, but not reversed once established. Taken
together, these data strongly suggest that the reader, the lysine,
and the KDM/KMT balance are required to maintain regulation at
these regions. Therefore, we hypothesize that the local chro-
matin environment will be an important determinant in desig-
nating whether certain regions are more susceptible to copy
gains and rereplication (see Figure S7M). Based on our observa-
tions, we also believe that other methyltransferases or chromatin
modulators (e.g., readers or remodelers) may be able to block or
reset the established chromatin state in KDM4A-overexpressing
cells or that these modulators may have their own independent
roles in regulating site-speciﬁc copy gains.
KDM4A and Rereplication
Increased KDM4A occupancy promotes a more open chromatin
environment through decreasing H3K9me3 and HP1g occu-
pancy (Figure S7M; Black et al., 2010). KDM4A overexpression
also promotes recruitment of the replication licensing machinery
and DNA polymerases to sites of rereplication and copy gain
(Figure S7M, model). Because copy gains require the KDM4A
Tudor domains, we favor the model that KDM4A directly
increased chromatin accessibility and, in turn, loading of the
MCM and replication complex on chromatin (Figure S7M). This
loading and rereplication could occur in the absence of CDT1,
CDC6, and ORC, as they are not necessary for replication after
MCMs have been successfully loaded (Arias and Walter, 2007).
However, the more open chromatin could independently pro-
mote inappropriate recruitment of MCMs and DNA polymerases
to unused or reused origins, thus promoting rereplication (Fig-
ure S7M). This later model would be consistent with the observa-
tion that interfering with H3K9 or K36 methylation can promote
the site-speciﬁc gain in cells with wild-type KDM4A levels.
Regardless of the exact details, the data presented in this study
support the model that alterations of heterochromatin and
methylation at speciﬁc regions are more prone to rereplication
and, in turn, copy gain.
KDM4A and Extrachromosomal DNA
Because the extra copies of 1q12 are not inherited but are
removed prior to completion of G2, it is likely that such regions
exist as extrachromosomal DNA (Figures S7H and S7L). As
such, it is possible that KDM4A is promoting rereplication at re-
gions that promote head-to-tail collision of one replication fork
chasing another (Figure S7M). This model ﬁts a previous study
showing that deregulation of replication licensing promotes
DNA fragmentation and was consistent with fork collision (Da-
vidson et al., 2006). The presence of these fragments could
also explain why KDM4A-overexpressing cells exhibit a moder-
ate increase in p53 stabilization (Figure S2H); that remains
below the threshold required to elicit the p53 checkpoint (Kraci-
kova et al., 2013). It is also possible that site-speciﬁc rereplica-
tion may not be restricted to cancer cells. Transiently upregulat-
ing enzymes that direct site-speciﬁc rereplication to increase
copy number of speciﬁc genes may be a general mechanism
to allow cells the plasticity to respond to developmental, envi-
ronmental, or stress conditions without altering their genetic
makeup.
KDM4A-Dependent Transient Copy Gain
Because transient KDM4A overexpression was sufﬁcient to
promote localized changes in copy number in a single cell cycle,
the ampliﬁcation of speciﬁc regions may precede genetic
changes in tumors. For instance, transient misregulation of chro-
matin regulators by altered environmental factors, metabolic
changes, hypoxia, or miRNAs could lead to temporary changes
in copy number of small genomic regions. If these regions
contain oncogenes, this could create a feedback loop that pro-
motes tumorigenesis while masking the originating event (e.g.,
transient upregulation of KDM4A). Of note, several putative
oncogenes reside in the 1q12 and 1q21 cytogenetic bands,
including BCL9 and MCL1. In fact, KDM4A binds the BCL9 locus
and causes both copy gain and rereplication of this site (1q21.2
region, Figures 7W and 7V, respectively). However, we do not
observe increased expression of Bcl9, which likely reﬂects the
552

lack of additional stimulus, transcription factors, or the low per-
centage of cells with this particular copy gain (data not shown).
It remains unclear how the rereplicated regions are removed
as cells exit S phase and enter G2/M. It is possible that cells
possess an active method for degradation or removal of these
regions. Understanding the events leading to removal of inap-
propriately ampliﬁed regions could be critical to helping to iden-
tify pathways that may be misregulated in cancer and lead to the
accumulation and inheritance of copy number changes. We
hypothesize that other events could then promote incorporation
of these transiently ampliﬁed regions and, in turn, inﬂuence
tumorigenesis.
Conclusions
It is clear that the chromatin context inﬂuences replication timing
and initiation choices. However, chromatin may additionally play
an important role in ensuring replication ﬁdelity and preventing
rereplication. Distinct chromatin domains may have increased
propensity for rereplication under different circumstances and
cell types. This is supported by work in Drosophila that demon-
strates that heterochromatic regions rereplicate upon loss of
geminin (Ding and MacAlpine, 2010). Additionally, some chro-
matin modiﬁers such as KMT5A/B/C regulate rereplication on a
more global scale (Beck et al., 2012; Tardat et al., 2010). Taken
together, these results suggest that proper regulation of chro-
matin state is critical for suppressing rereplication. Therefore, a
‘‘chromatin checkpoint’’ may be intimately associated with the
timing of replication and the propensity to undergo rereplication
and copy gain.
Although we have uncovered a single enzyme that can regu-
late site-speciﬁc copy gain, several additional questions remain
to be answered (Figure S7M). How does the chromatin environ-
ment regulate CNV? Is regulation of methylation of nonhistone
substrates involved in modulating copy number (e.g., replication
machinery and/or HP1)? Do additional chromatin modiﬁers regu-
late CNV and contribute to tumor heterogeneity? What events
could promote transient copy gains to be inherited? Future
studies that identify additional factors and/or stimuli that address
these questions will allow for a more complete picture surround-
ing copy number variation, rereplication, genome stability, and
cancer to emerge.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Extended Experimental Procedures are included in the Supplemental
Information.
Cell Culture
Generation of stable cell lines, constructs, and antibodies used can be found in
the Extended Experimental Procedures. Transient H3.3 variant RPE cells were
transduced with lentiviral stocks provided from the Allis lab in the presence of
8 mg/ml polybrene for 8 hr (Lewis et al., 2013).
Subcellular Localization and Catalytic Activity of KDM4A Deletion
Fragments
H3K36me3 and subcellular localization were assayed by examining trans-
fected cells (positive for HA staining; HA.11 Covance) following ﬁxation in
3.7% PFA in PBS (Whetstine et al., 2006).
Immunoprecipitation and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
HaloTag-puriﬁed KDM4A complexes were analyzed and processed by MS
Bioworks (Ann Arbor, Michigan), with details in the Extended Experimental
Procedures.
Immunoprecipitations
(IP)
were
performed
essentially
as
described in Van Rechem et al. (2011).
Chromatin IPs were performed as in Black et al. (2010) with some
minor
changes.
Sonication
was
performed
using
a
Qsonica
Q800R
system with a constant chiller. RPE cells were arrested in 2 mM HU for
20 hr prior to crosslinking to assess enrichment in KDM4A, HP1g,
H3K9me3, H3K36me3, and DNA polymerase a at G1/S transition. Data
presented are averages from the two independently prepared polyclonal
RPE cell lines from at least two independent chromatin preparations per
cell line.
Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed as described in Mann-
ing et al. (2010). Probes for 1q12h, 1q telomere, 6p21/chr 14 IGH translocation,
and chromosomes 2, 6, 8, and X alpha satellite were purchased from Rainbow
Scientiﬁc. Probes for 1q12/21.1 (RP11-17L12), Xq13.2 (RP11-451A22), and
Xq13.1 (RP11-177A4) were purchased as BAC clones from Children’s Hospital
Oakland Research Institute (CHORI BacPac) FISH veriﬁed clone repository.
Probes for 1q21.2 (BCL9) and 1q23.3 were purchased from Agilent (SureFISH).
For RPE cells, copy gain was scored as any cell with three or more distinct foci.
For 293T cells, copy gain was scored for any cell with ﬁve or more distinct foci.
Comprehensive methods can be found in the Extended Experimental
Procedures.
Cesium Chloride Gradient Centrifugation
RPE cells were treated with 100 mM BrdU 14 hr prior to harvest. DNA was
puriﬁed, digested with RNase A, EcoRI, and BamHI (NEB), and resuspended
in TE. 100 mg of DNA was mixed with CsCl in TE (refractive index of 1.4015–
1.4031). The CsCl gradient was centrifuged at 44,400 RPM in a VTi-65 rotor
for 72 hr at 25C. Fractions were collected in 200 ml aliquots, and DNA con-
centration was measured by Nanodrop. Appropriate fractions were pooled,
dialyzed, concentrated, and ethanol precipitated. Each rereplicated pool
was diluted to 15 ng/ul stock, and 7.5 ng of rereplicated DNA pool was
analyzed by qPCR. Each sample was normalized to its own input prior to
determination of fold change in rereplication. Primers used in this study will
be provided upon request.
Determination of Cytoband Copy Number and Correlation with
KDM4A
Sample-speciﬁc mean focal copy numbers for 807 cytobands including X
chromosome were annotated by taking an average of GISTIC annotated
focal copy numbers for every gene within the same cytoband. The p values
for the mean focal copy number changes between KDM4A copy-gained
samples (GISTIC annotation = +1 or +2) and KDM4A copy-neutral samples
(GISTIC annotation = 0) across 807 cytobands were annotated by two inde-
pendent statistical tests (Figures 6A–6C and S6A–S6C; see the Extended
Experimental Procedures for details). As positive controls, we also calculated
the signiﬁcance using the gene-speciﬁc copy number for KDM4A and
KDM4B. The empirical cumulative distribution functions (the fraction of sam-
ples below the given mean focal copy) were determined by enumerating
samples having the mean focal copy number less than or equal to the value
on the x axis in Figures S6D–S6I for KDM4A- and KDM4B-ampliﬁed (+2),
copy-gained (+1), and copy-neutral samples (0). Procedures for RNA-seq
and ovarian cancer outcome can be found in the Extended Experimental
Procedures.

Supplemental Information
EXTENDED EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture
HEK293T (called 293T throughout) and hTERT-RPE-1 (called RPE throughout) cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine. Stable 293T cell lines were generated as in (Black et al., 2010). Stable RPE cell
lines were generated by retroviral transduction of MSCV-GFP or MSCV-GFP-KDM4A. Cells were selected for 96 hr with puromycin.
All experiments on stable cells were performed after two months of culture post infection with KDM4A. Transient transfection exper-
iments were performed using Roche X-tremeGENE 9 DNA transfection reagent in OPTI-MEM I media (GIBCO) for four hours. Media
was then replaced with standard DMEM. For concomitant overexpression and depletion in 293T cells, shRNA was transfected for
4 hr, cells recovered in DMEM for 20 hr and cells were transfected a second time with additional shRNA and KDM4A expression
plasmid. Cells were harvested for FISH 48 hr following the second transfection. No selection was used in transient transfection
experiments.
Expression Plasmids
The pFN21A clone expressing an N-Terminal HaloTag fusion of human full-length KDM4A or Suv39h1 (NM_014663) was obtained
from Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Kisarazu, Japan). HaloTag (ADN27525.1) control vector (Promega) was used for expression
of the HaloTag protein alone. MSCV-GFP-KDM4A, MSCV-GFP-H188A, MSCV-RFP-HP1, pSuper and pSuper sh2A.1 constructs
were made as described (Black et al., 2010). N-terminal HA-FLAG (NHF) deletion constructs were generated using primers at the
indicated amino acid residues and cloned into pEntry using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). Fragments were transferred to N-ter-
minal HA-FLAG (NHF) destination vector following the manufacturer’s instructions. H188A contains two point mutations to eliminate
catalytic activity H188A and W208R (Black et al., 2010). All clones were sequence veriﬁed.
Western Blots
Western blots were performed as in (Black et al., 2010). Antibodies used were: KDM4A (Neuro mAB, 75-189), b-actin (Millipore), GFP
(Neuro mAB, 73-131), RFP (Abcam, ab62341), p53 (Santa Cruz, sc-126), MCM2 (Cell Signaling, #3619S), MCM3 (Cell Signaling,
#4012S), MCM7 (Cell Signaling, #3735S), Halo (Promega), Actinin (Santa Cruz, sc-17829), HA 12CA5 (Roche), FLAG M2 (Sigma),
DNA Pol a (Abcam, ab31777).
G-Band and Spectral Karyotyping
G-Band analysis was performed and analyzed by WiCell Cytogenetics Institute (Wisconsin). SKY and corresponding analysis was
performed by Cristina Montagna in the Molecular Cytogenetic Core at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The RPE stable cell lines
were analyzed by SKY two independent times: once after six months in culture and a second time after an additional three months of
culture.
Subcellular Localization and Catalytic Activity of KDM4A Deletion Fragments
The indicated NHF-tagged KDM4A deletion constructs were transfected into RPE cells grown on coverslips in 10 cm dishes using X-
tremeGENE 9 DNA transfection reagent (Roche). H3K36me3 and subcellular localization were assayed by examining transfected
cells (positive for HA staining; HA.11 Covance) following ﬁxation in 3.7% PFA in PBS (Whetstine et al., 2006).
Immunoprecipitation and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described in (Van Rechem et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, cells were lysed in cellular lysis
buffer (5mM PIPES, 85mM KCl, 0.5% NP40) and nuclei were collected following centrifugation. Nuclei were lysed in IPH buffer with
sonication, lysates were cleared and immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of 100ug/ml ethidium bromide and di-
gested with 0.25ul benzonase to eliminate protein-nucleic acid interactions. Immunoprecipitation from 293T cells were carried out in
IPH with 150mM NaCl and from RPE cells in 300mM NaCl. Immunoprecipitation of HaloTag polymerase subunits with endogenous
KDM4A was performed according to the manufacturers protocol (Promega) with minor modiﬁcation. Whole cell lysates were pre-
pared using sonication of cells in Halo lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitations were performed with ethidium bromide overnight at
4þC. Elution was performed using SDS sample loading buffer.
Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as in (Black et al., 2010) with some minor changes. Sonication was performed
using a Qsonica Q800R system with a constant chiller. For ChIP, RPE cells were arrested in 2mM HU for 20 hr prior to crosslinking to
assess enrichment in KDM4A, HP1g, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, and DNA polymerase a at G1/S transition. For release from HU (as indi-
cated in ﬁgures), HU containing media was removed by aspiration, and cells were rinsed twice with fresh DMEM prior to addition of
fresh DMEM for release for the indicated times. 1 to 10ug of chromatin was used for each IP, which was dependent on the antibody
used. For HP1g, chromatin was prepared and sonicated in TE with 1%SDS, diluted to 0.2% SDS prior to dilution for the immuno-
precipitation. Chromatin for histone ChIP was prepared and sonicated in TE with 1% SDS. Chromatin for KDM4A, Pola, and
MCM7 was prepared and sonicated in TE with 0.2% SDS. Prior to ChIP, RPE chromatin was precleared for one hour with protein
A agarose, and for one hour with magnetic protein A or G beads (Invitrogen; to match antibody type). Immunoprecipitated DNA
was puriﬁed using either PCR Puriﬁcation Columns (Promega) or AMPureXP. Data presented are averages from the two

independently prepared polyclonal RPE cell lines from at least two independent chromatin preparations per cell line. Antibodies used
for ChIP are as follows: DNA Pola (Abcam, ab31777 lot 290601), MCM7 (Cell Signaling, #3735S lots 02/2013 and 03/2013), KDM4A
(Black et al., 2010), HP1g (Millipore, 05-690 lot DAM1501782), H3K9me3 (Abcam, ab8898 lot GR30928-1), H3K36me3 (Abcam,
ab9050 lot GR10860-1), H3 (Abcam, ab1791 lot GR63387-1).
KDM4A Cytogentic Band Enrichment
KDM4A ChIP-chip on chromosome 1–4 was reported previously (Van Rechem et al., 2011). Raw data was re-analyzed as follows.
ChIP signals were log-transformed (base 2) and normalized by using quantile normalization then averaged over replicates. Input
signals were also quantile normalized and the results were subtracted from the normalized ChIP signals, and the results were referred
to as log-ratio. Cytogenetic band locations were downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser using HG18. The probe-level log-ratio
values were averaged over each cytogenetic band and then each cytogenetic band was transformed to z-scores. Raw data are
deposited under GSE48765.
Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed as described in (Manning et al., 2010). Probes for 1q12h, 1q telomere, 6p21/
chr14 IGH translocation and chromosome 2, 6, 8, and X alpha satellite were purchased from Rainbow Scientiﬁc. Probes for 1q12/
21.1 (RP11-17L12), Xq13.2 (RP11-451A22), Xq13.1 (RP11-177A4) were purchased as BAC clones from Children’s Hospital Oakland
Research Institute (CHORI BacPac) FISH veriﬁed clone repository. Oligonucleotide probes for 1q21.2 (BCL9) and 1q23.3 were pur-
chased from Agilent (SureFISH). BACS were prepared utilizing PureLink HiPure Plasmid Filter Maxiprep kit (Life Technologies) using
the recommended modiﬁed wash buffer. Probes were nick translated (Abbot Molecular Kit) in the presence of ﬂuorescently labeled
dTTP (Enzo Life Science). Images of multiple planes of ﬁelds of nuclei were acquired on an Olympus IX81 Spinning Disk Microscope
and analyzed using Slidebook 5.0 software. We used a conservative scoring metric for copy gain. Any foci that were touching were
scored as a single foci to prevent increased numbers due to normally replicated foci. For RPE cells, copy gain was scored as any cell
with 3 or more distinct foci. For 293T cells, copy gain was scored for any cell with 5 or more distinct foci. For RPE cells each exper-
iment includes at least one replicate from the two different polyclonal stable cell preparations. At least 100 cells for each replicate
were scored for all experiments except analysis of single cell clones.
Infection with Histone H3.3 Variants
Lentiviral stocks provided from the Allis lab were used to infect RPE cells in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene for 8 hr (Lewis et al.,
2013). Cells were washed 2 times with DMEM. Cells were collected 24 hr later for analysis by FISH and Western blot. Incorporation of
histone variants was conﬁrmed by subcellular fractionation and Western blotting.
Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization Coupled to Chromosome 1 Paint
FISH/Paint was performed using the 1q12/21 probe labeled in Spectrum Orange combined with a chromosome 1 painting probe
labeled in Spectrum Green. The chromosome paint probe was generated using standard protocols (Montagna et al., 2002). Equal
volumes of locus speciﬁc and paint probe resuspended in hybridization solution (50% dextran sulfate/2 3 SSC) were combined
and denatured at 85C for 5 min, applied to the slides and incubated overnight at 37C in a humidiﬁed chamber. Before hybridization
the slides with interphase nuclei were denatured with 50% formamide/2 3 SSC at 80C for 1.5 min and then dehydrated with serial
ethanol washing steps (ice cold 70%, 90% and 100% for 3 min each). After hybridization the slides were washed three times for 5 min
with 50% formamide/2 3 SSC, 1 3 SSC and 4 3 SSC/0.1%Tween. Slides were dehydrated with serial ethanol washing steps (as
above) and mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) for imaging. FISH/Paint images were acquired
with a manual inverted ﬂuorescence microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss) with ﬁne focusing oil immersion lens ( 3 40, NA 1.3 oil and
3 60, NA 1.35 oil). Multiple focal planes were acquired for each channel to ensure that signals on different focal planes were included.
The resulting ﬂuorescence emissions were collected using 425–475 nm (for DAPI), 546–600 nm (for spectrum orange), and 500–
550 nm (for AlexaFluor488) ﬁlters. The microscope was equipped with a Camera Hall 100 and the Applied Spectral Imaging software.
Cesium Chloride Gradient Centrifugation
RPE cells were treated with 100 mM BrdU 14 hr prior to harvest. Cells were lysed in RIPA supplemented with 100mg of RNase A
(Fisher) for 2 hr at 37C. Buffer was supplemented to 1% SDS and 20 mg of proteinase K was added and digested overnight at
55C. DNA was extracted three times with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and ethanol precipitated. Precipitated DNA (approx-
imately 300 mg) was resuspended in NEB buffer 2 supplemented with RNase A and digested with 200U of EcoRI and BamHI (NEB)
overnight at 37C. Digests were supplemented to 1% SDS and digested with 10 mg of proteinase K for 1 hr at 55C. DNA was ex-
tracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and ethanol precipitated. Precipitated DNA was resuspended in TE and concentra-
tion determined by Nanodrop. 100 mg of DNA was mixed with 1g/ml CsCl in TE (refractive index of 1.4015-1.4031) in Quick-Seal ul-
tracentrifuge tubes (Beckman). The CsCl gradient was centrifuged at 44,400 RPM in a VTi-65 rotor for 72 hr at 25C. Fractions were
collected from the bottom of the gradient in 200 ml aliquots. DNA concentration of each fraction was measured by Nanodrop.
Appropriate fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 0.1X TE and concentrated by dialysis against 0.1XTE with 40% glycerol.
Concentrated pools were ethanol precipitated and resuspended in ddH2O prior to analysis by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Each

re-replicated fraction was diluted to 15ng/ul stock and 7.5ng of re-replicated DNA pool was analyzed by qPCR on a Roche LC480
using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 7.5ng of input DNA was
analyzed by qPCR at the same time. Each sample was normalized to its own input prior to determination of fold-change in re-repli-
cation. Primers used in this study will be provided upon request.
HaloTag Mammalian Pull-Down Assay for Mass Spectrometry
HEK293T cells (12 3 106 cells) were plated in a 150 mm dish and grown to 70%–80% conﬂuence (approximately 18 hr). The cells
were then transfected with 30mg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Promega) for 24 hr, according to manu-
facturer’s protocol. Cells expressing Halo-KDM4A or Halo-CTRL were incubated in mammalian lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
150mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Promega) and RQ1
RNase-Free DNase (Promega) for 10 min on ice. Lysate was then homogenized with a syringe and centrifuged at 14.000 x g for 5 min
to pellet cellular debris. Clariﬁed lysate was incubated with HaloLink Resin (Promega) that had been pre-equilibrated in resin wash
buffer (TBS and 0.05% IGEPAL CA-640 [Sigma]) for 15 min at 22C with rotation. Resin was then washed 5 times with wash buffer,
and protein interactors were eluted with SDS elution buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1% SDS).
Mass Spectrometry Analysis
HaloTag pulldown puriﬁed complexes were analyzed and processed by MS Bioworks, LLC (Ann Arbor, Michigan). The samples were
separated on a SDS-PAGE gel, which was then Coomassie stained and cut into 10 fragments. Each gel piece was processed with the
Progest Protein Digestion Station (Digilab). Brieﬂy, gel slices were washed using 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile,
followed by reduction with 10 mM dithiothreitol, and alkylation with 50 mM iodoacetamide. Proteins were digested with trypsin
(Promega) for 4 hr and digestion was quenched with formic acid. Gel digests were analyzed directly by nano LC/MS/MS with a Nano-
Acquity HPLC (Waters) interfaced with an Orbitrap Velos Pro (Thermo Scientiﬁc) tandem mass spectrometer. Digested peptides were
loaded on a trapping column and eluted over a 75 mm analytical column packed with Jupiter Proteo Resin (Phenomenex) at 350nl/
min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, with MS performed in the Orbitrap at 60.000 full width at half
maximum (FWHM) resolution, and MS/MS performed in the LTQ. The 15 most abundant ions were selected for MS/MS. The data
were searched with Mascot (Matrix Science) against the concatenated forward/decoy UniProt Human Database, and Mascot
DAT ﬁles were visualized and ﬁltered by Scaffold (Proteome Software). Data were ﬁltered using a minimum protein value of 90%,
a minimum peptide value of 50% (Protein and Peptide Prophet scores), and required at least two unique peptides per protein. Spec-
tral counting was performed and normalized spectral abundance factors determined. Data were reported at less than 1% false dis-
covery rate (FDR) at the protein level based on counting the number of forward and decoy matches. Interacting proteins were
analyzed using IPA for pathway analysis (Ingenuity Systems).
Flow Cytometry Analysis of Cell Cycle and Apoptosis
Asynchronously growing, or G1/S or G2 arrested cells were prepared and ﬁxed as in (Black et al., 2010). Cell cycle was analyzed by PI
staining and analyzed using a BD FACS ARIA II. Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V and PI staining following the manufac-
turer’s instructions (Life Technologies).
KDM4A Copy Number Determination in TCGA Data Set
The somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) for 24,176 genes of the pan-cancer data set including 4,420 samples across multiple
tumor types are annotated by GISTIC2.0 (Beroukhim et al., 2007; Beroukhim et al., 2010; Network, 2008). The copy number change in
each gene is deﬁned as possessing deep deletion (2), shallow deletions (1), neutral copy number (0), low gain (+1), and high gain
(+2) in each sample using sample-speciﬁc thresholds. High gains are segments with copy number that exceed the maximum median
chromosomal arm copy number for that sample by at least 0.1; low gains are segments with copy numbers from 2.1 to the high gain
threshold; neutral segments have copy numbers between 1.9 and 2.1; shallow losses have copy numbers between 1.9 and the deep
deletion threshold; and deep deletion have copy numbers that are below the minimum median chromosomal arm copy number for
that sample by at least 0.1.
KDM4A mRNA expression from RNA-Seq in TCGA Data Set
Reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) were annotated for 16,407 genes in 1,953 samples across
multiple tumor types. 1770 samples having both copy number and RPKM data were used to quantify an association between
copy number alterations and the mRNA expression levels in KDM4A in Figure 1B and 1D, and Figure S1. The ‘‘Gain’’ group
corresponds to the sample set with KDM4A GISTIC annotation = +1 or +2, the ‘‘No change’’ group corresponds to the
samples set with KDM4A GISTIC annotation = 0, and the ‘‘Loss’’ group is associated to the sample set with KDM4A GISTIC
annotation = 1 or 2.
Clinical Data in TCGA Data Set
Overall survival in 541 Ovarian Cancer samples (256 alive and 285 deceased) was deﬁned as the interval from the date of initial sur-
gical resection to the date of last known contact or death. The association of the KDM4A copy number status, Del (2), Loss (1),

None (0), Gain (+1), Amp (+2) to the clinical outcome in Figure 1E through 1H was tested for 285 deceased patients by Student’s t test
(one-tailed) and statistical signiﬁcance was considered when p < 0.05.
Determination of Cytoband Copy Number and Correlation with KDM4A in TCGA Data Set
In addition to the copy number annotation for each gene, the mean focal copy number for 807 cytobands including X chromosome
were annotated in each sample by taking an average of focal copy numbers of every genes within the same cytoband. Arm-level
SCNA contributions to the mean focal copy number in each cytoband were removed by only considering GISTIC annotated focal
copy numbers much smaller than a chromosome arm or entire chromosome. Detecting chromosomal regions signiﬁcantly co-ampli-
ﬁed with KDM4A copy gains or ampliﬁcations was ﬁrst performed by the one-tailed Student’s t test for the mean focal copy number
changes between KDM4A copy-gained samples (GISTIC annotation = +1 or +2) and KDM4A copy-neutral samples (GISTIC anno-
tation = 0) across 807 cytobands. We also calculated the signiﬁcance using the gene-speciﬁc copy-number for KDM4A and
KDM4B as positive controls (Figure 6A-C). We also performed the second independent test (Figure S6A-S6C) by approximating a
null distribution of mean cytoband copy differences by a normal function Nðm12  m0; s2
0=n0 + s2
12=n12Þ where m0and m12are samples
means across all cytobands, s2
0 and s2
12are mean sample-speciﬁc variances within each group, and n0and n12are the number of sam-
ples in KDM4A copy-neutral and KDM4A copy-gained groups, respectively. This test is based on comparing the means of the two
sets while permuting values within each of the samples (and using a Gaussian approximation). The p-values across 807 cytobands
were annotated by computing the probability of more extreme differences than the corresponding cytoband copy difference in
the null distribution. The empirical cumulative distribution functions (the fraction of samples below the given mean focal copy)
were determined by enumerating samples having the mean focal copy number less than or equal to the value on the x axis in
Figure S6D-S6I for KDM4A and KDM4B ampliﬁed (+2), copy-gained (+1), and copy-neutral samples (0).

Figure S7. Extra Copies of 1q12/21 Can Be Found Outside of the Chromosome 1 Domain in Interphase Cells, Related to Figure 7
(A–L) Combined Chromosome 1 Paint (Green) and 1q12/21 FISH (Red) demonstrates that extra copies of 1q12/21 can be found adjacent to or outside chro-
mosome 1 domains. Scale bar represents 5 mm.
(M) Schematic depicting the model by which KDM4A could promote copy number gain. Our results support a model where increased expression of KDM4A
promotes recruitment of KDM4A to speciﬁc genomic regions and promotes rereplication. Increased KDM4A at these loci promotes a more open chromatin
environment through removal of H3K9me3 and eviction of HP1g. Increasing levels of Suv39h1 or HP1g is sufﬁcient to block this altered chromatin state. These
altered chromatin domains could then support rereplication through increased recruitment of MCMs and DNA polymerases, which could be facilitated directly
through interactions with KDM4A. Alternatively, the more open chromatin generated by KDM4A could indirectly promote inappropriate recruitment of MCMs and
DNA polymerases to unused or reused origins, thus promoting rereplication. The inappropriate rereplication within these regions could then result in head-to-tail
collision of one replication fork chasing another. These collisions would then generate extrachromosomal DNA fragments. The ‘‘?’’ represent possibilities that
need further testing.
