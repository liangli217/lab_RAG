During cancer therapy, tumor heterogeneity can drive the 
evolution of multiple tumor subclones harboring unique 
resistance mechanisms in an individual patient1–3. Previous 
case reports and small case series have suggested that liquid 
biopsy (specifically, cell-free DNA (cfDNA)) may better cap-
ture the heterogeneity of acquired resistance4–8. However, the 
effectiveness of cfDNA versus standard single-lesion tumor 
biopsies has not been directly compared in larger-scale pro-
spective cohorts of patients following progression on targeted 
therapy. Here, in a prospective cohort of 42 patients with 
molecularly defined gastrointestinal cancers and acquired 
resistance to targeted therapy, direct comparison of post-
progression cfDNA versus tumor biopsy revealed that cfDNA 
more frequently identified clinically relevant resistance 
alterations and multiple resistance mechanisms, detect-
ing resistance alterations not found in the matched tumor 
biopsy in 78% of cases. Whole-exome sequencing of serial 
cfDNA, tumor biopsies and rapid autopsy specimens eluci-
dated substantial geographic and evolutionary differences 
across lesions. Our data suggest that acquired resistance is 
frequently characterized by profound tumor heterogeneity, 
and that the emergence of multiple resistance alterations in 
an individual patient may represent the ‘rule’ rather than the 
‘exception’. These findings have profound therapeutic impli-
cations and highlight the potential advantages of cfDNA over 
tissue biopsy in the setting of acquired resistance.
The inevitable emergence of acquired resistance is a major limita-
tion of current targeted therapies9. Several key studies highlight the 
potential role that tumor heterogeneity plays in the emergence of 
resistance3,4,7,10–14. In acquired resistance, the evolutionary pressure 
of therapy can drive outgrowth of distinct tumor subclones harbor-
ing independent resistance mechanisms in an individual patient, 
within different metastatic lesions or within the same lesion1,5,7,10,13. 
Genomic analysis of standard single-lesion tumor biopsies on dis-
ease progression has been the mainstay of identifying mechanisms 
of acquired resistance, but recent studies suggest that tumor biop-
sies may vastly under-represent the heterogeneity of resistance in a 
single patient5,7,10,15,16. In particular, analyzing a core biopsy from one 
region of a single metastatic lesion may fail to detect clinically rel-
evant resistance mechanisms, leading to mixed responses or failure 
of subsequent therapy3,7,17.
Liquid biopsy—specifically, cell-free DNA (cfDNA)—may offer 
advantages for assessing tumor heterogeneity4,18,19. Tumor-derived 
cfDNA (also termed circulating tumor DNA) is shed from tumor 
cells throughout the body. Therefore, cfDNA analysis can poten-
tially identify multiple concurrent heterogeneous resistance mecha-
nisms in individual patients that single-lesion tumor biopsies may 
miss8,20–22. While case reports and small case series have suggested 
advantages of cfDNA4,5,7,23, cfDNA and tumor biopsy have not been 
directly compared in larger-scale prospective patient cohorts fol-
lowing progression on targeted therapy.
Therefore, we evaluated a prospective cohort of molecularly 
defined gastrointestinal cancer patients who developed acquired 
resistance to targeted therapy. Through a systematic, disease center-
wide liquid biopsy program, 42 patients who achieved stable disease 
or partial response to targeted therapy underwent liquid biopsy.

When possible, a matched tumor biopsy at the time of eventual dis-
ease progression was obtained (23 patients). Patients encompassed 
seven molecular subtypes across three tumor types (Supplementary 
Table 1), offering a general assessment of cfDNA on acquired 
resistance. To identify candidate-acquired resistance mechanisms, 
cfDNA isolated from postprogression plasma was analyzed by 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify emergent altera-
tions not detected in pretreatment tumor or cfDNA. Targeted NGS 
was performed in all cases, with parallel whole-exome sequencing 
(WES) when the tumor fraction in cfDNA was sufficient (>5%). 
Only previously reported and functionally validated resistance 
alterations were counted as resistance mechanisms5,7,8,12,13,15,21–35 
(Supplementary Table 2).
Postprogression cfDNA identified at least one previously vali-
dated resistance alteration in 32 out of 42 (76%) patients. Notably, 
17 (53%) of these 32 patients (40% of all patients) exhibited >1 
detectable resistance alteration (range: 2–9; median: 3 per patient), 
suggesting frequent and profound tumor heterogeneity associ-
ated with acquired resistance (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). 
In total, 78 clinically relevant resistance alterations were found in 
cfDNA across multiple molecularly defined tumor types receiving 
various targeted therapies.
To compare the effectiveness of cfDNA versus standard tumor 
biopsy, we analyzed matched postprogression tumor biopsies from 
23 patients by WES and/or targeted NGS, and compared them 
with pretreatment tumor tissue. Tumor biopsy identified resistance 
alterations less frequently than cfDNA in only 11 out of 23 (48%) 
patients (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1), whereas cfDNA identi-
fied at least one resistance alteration in 20 out of 23 (87%) patients, 
and in 76% of all patients. Moreover, multiple resistance alterations 
were identified in the postprogression biopsy in only two of the 23 
cases (9%). This contrasts with cfDNA, where 40% of patients har-
bored multiple resistance alterations, with up to nine alterations in a 
single patient. Overall, postprogression cfDNA identified additional 
clinically relevant resistance alterations not detected in the postpro-
gression tumor biopsies in 18 out of 23 (78%) cases.
Conversely, only one of the 23 (4%) postprogression tumor 
biopsies identified a resistance alteration that was not detected in 
matched postprogression cfDNA by NGS. In TPS125—a patient

anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody cetux-
imab—an EGFRK489E mutation affecting the receptor’s antibody-
binding domain was identified in a postprogression biopsy at 11.9% 
allele frequency (cancer cell fraction (CCF): 78%). EGFRK489E was 
not detected by clinical NGS in postprogression cfDNA, but was 
detected on reanalysis using high-sensitivity droplet digital PCR 
(ddPCR) at 0.53% allele frequency (near the lower detection limit 
of clinical NGS assays for cfDNA; Supplementary Table 4). Thus, 
some low-level resistance alterations in rare tumor subclones may 
exist below the detection level in cfDNA with current technologies. 
Still, remarkably, every resistance alteration identified in a postpro-
gression tumor biopsy was also detectable in matched cfDNA, sug-
gesting that, while possible, missing resistance alterations by cfDNA 
analysis may be infrequent.
Interestingly, five cases with postprogression tumor biopsies had 
subsequent tumor specimens available for analysis, obtained dur-
ing standard clinical care or through an institutional rapid autopsy 
program. In all cases, additional resistance mechanisms detected 
in postprogression cfDNA were later found in distinct metastatic 
lesions (Extended Data Fig. 2).
TPS037—a 53-year-old male with metastatic BRAFV600E CRC—
was treated with a combination of EGFR, BRAF and phosphoinosit-
ide 3-kinase inhibitor-α inhibitors (cetuximab, encorafenib and 
alpelisib; NCT01719380) for 16 months before tumor progres-
sion15. Biopsy of a progressing liver lesion revealed the original 
BRAFV600E mutation and an emergent KRASG12S mutation (Fig. 2a). 
Postprogression cfDNA analysis by clinical NGS (Guardant360) 
showed not only the original BRAFV600E and the emergent KRASG12S 
mutations, but also NRASQ61R and low-level EGFR amplifica-
tion—all known resistance mechanisms in BRAFV600E CRC15,24,32. 
Subsequently, the patient underwent: (1) resection of a brain metas-
tasis; (2) a second protocol-related liver biopsy; and (3) biopsy of a 
symptomatic subcutaneous soft-tissue lesion.
To better understand the subclonal architecture of resistance, 
postprogression tumor specimens and cfDNA were analyzed by 
WES. Consistent with previous reports, the original, likely clonal, 
BRAFV600E mutation persisted in all specimens (Fig. 2a). KRASG12S 
was detected by WES in both liver biopsies, but not in the brain 
or soft-tissue metastases. Interestingly, the brain lesion harbored an 
EGFR amplification not detected in any other tumor specimen but 
detected at low levels in cfDNA by clinical NGS. High-sensitivity 
ddPCR analysis of each tumor specimen also identified KRASG12S 
(allele frequency: 0.17%) in the subcutaneous lesion and NRASQ61R 
(allele frequency: 3.1%) in one liver biopsy (Supplementary Table 4). 
Thus, all three resistance alterations identified in cfDNA were 
identified in at least one of the postprogression tumor samples, 
although no single biopsy harbored all alterations. The clonal archi-
tecture and phylogenetic relationship of the four postprogression 
tumor biopsies and cfDNA by WES (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary 
Table 5) showed shared clonal (truncal), private clonal and 
subclonal alterations present across various samples. Consistent 
with the detectability in cfDNA of all resistance alterations pres-
ent in the individual tumor biopsies, each clonal alteration and the 
majority of subclonal mutation clusters found in different tumor 
biopsies were represented (at clonal or subclonal frequencies) in 
cfDNA, again highlighting the ability of cfDNA to capture hetero-
geneous molecular alterations present in distinct tumor lesions in 
an individual patient.
Similarly, TPS177—a 58-year-old woman with metastatic gas-
tric adenocarcinoma harboring a fusion between CD44 (exons 1–8) 
and FGFR2 (exons 3–18)—received the FGFR inhibitor Debio1347 
(NCT01948297), achieving stable disease for 4 months before pro-
gression. Serial cfDNA analysis (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 4) 
revealed an initial decrease in the abundance of a clonal founder 
mutation RHOAY42C (representative of the overall tumor burden), 
which rebounded rapidly on progression and was accompanied by 
the emergence of four FGFR2 mutations: (1) FGFR2V564L, affecting 
the gatekeeper residue in the inhibitor binding site; (2) FGFR2L617V; 
and (3) FGFR2E565A (all known mechanisms of resistance to FGFR 
inhibition); and (4) FGFR2S780L, which resides outside the kinase 
domain and may not represent a true resistance alteration7. As high-
level FGFR2 fusion amplification was present (>50–150 copies), the 
existence of a potential passenger mutation would not be surprising. 
The patient underwent biopsy of a progressing para-aortic lymph 
node, but unfortunately expired due to disease complications. Rapid 
autopsy yielded 17 tumor lesions from various anatomic sites.
We analyzed WES data from pretreatment and postprogression 
cfDNA, postprogression biopsy and 17 autopsy specimens (Fig. 3b–d 
and Supplementary Table 5), and studied the clones and their phy-
logenetic structure with PhylogicNDT36. Interestingly, FGFR2V564L 
(detected in postprogression cfDNA) was found predominantly 
in liver metastases, whereas FGFR2L617V (also in postprogression 
cfDNA) had an anticorrelated pattern, predominantly detected in 
other metastatic sites, suggesting that these alterations confer resis-
tance in different cell populations. FGFR2E565A, detected in cfDNA, 
was identified at low levels in a single liver lesion (D). Interestingly, 
autopsy specimens from the stomach (M, N and O)—the primary 
tumor site—harbored only low levels of either resistance alteration. 
WES and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of stomach lesions also did 
not detect clear evidence of the CD44–FGFR2 fusion, and showed 
markedly reduced FGFR2 expression levels and local copy num-
bers relative to other lesions (Fig. 3c). Phylogenetic analysis sug-
gested that subclones present in these lesions likely represent early 
ancestors (Fig. 3b, upper right branch) that may have existed before 
development of the CD44–FGFR2 fusion-containing clone that later 
seeded the majority of metastases. Thus, in these stomach lesions, 
resistance to FGFR inhibition may have occurred primarily due to 
outgrowth of an early fusion-negative clone. FGFR2 fusion as a late 
event is consistent with the biology of gastric cancer, where receptor 
tyrosine kinase amplifications (for example, ERBB2 or MET) can

occur as late events, leading to outgrowth of nonamplified clones 
during targeted therapy30,37–39. However, the presence of FGFR2 
resistance alterations at low levels suggests that some fusion-pos-
itive subclones may have remained in these lesions, but at levels 
too low to detect by WES or RNA-Seq. Overall, all three FGFR2  
mutations, and the majority of private alterations present in indi-
vidual tumors, were detected in postprogression cfDNA (Fig. 3c,d).
Our data illustrate that acquired resistance to targeted therapy 
in gastrointestinal cancers is highly heterogeneous, often with mul-
tiple resistance alterations per patient, and that liquid biopsy can

effectively detect multiple resistance alterations residing concur-
rently in distinct tumor subclones and different metastatic lesions. 
Remarkably, a resistance alteration detected in a tumor biopsy but 
not in the matched cfDNA by clinical NGS occurred in only one out 
of 23 cases. However, this alteration indeed existed in cfDNA and was 
detected using a higher-sensitivity method. Thus, while cfDNA anal-
ysis may miss rare tumor subclones, our study suggests effective rep-
resentation of alterations from multiple lesions in cfDNA. However, 
cfDNA detection effectiveness may differ by tumor type or metastatic 
site, or in tumors with low rates of circulating tumor DNA shedding.
This study has several potential limitations. Although it repre-
sents one of the largest direct comparisons of postprogression cfDNA 
and matched tumor biopsy to date, overall patient numbers remain 
limited. Thus, additional studies may further define the degree of 
heterogeneity on acquired resistance and its relevance beyond gas-
trointestinal cancers. Additionally, in some cases, multiple biopsies 
and rapid autopsy confirmed that the multiple resistance alterations 
detected in cfDNA were derived from specific tumor lesions, but 
multiple tumor specimens were not available for most patients. 
However, in a comparator cohort of patients with similar clinical 
characteristics (Supplementary Table 6) with cfDNA analysis after 
progression on standard cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, without 
targeted therapy, we did not observe emergence of any of the clini-
cally relevant resistance alterations listed in Supplementary Table 2, 
suggesting that resistance alterations detected in cfDNA in our 
study represent tumor-derived alterations emerging under selective 
pressure from targeted therapy. Finally, cfDNA analysis is unlikely 
to detect nongenetic resistance mechanisms; in 24% of cases, no 
resistance mechanisms were detected by cfDNA or tumor biopsy. 
Although analysis of alterations in these patients revealed shared 
patterns between copy-number alterations and tumors having a 
known mechanism, a clear genomic driver of resistance could not 
be identified (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 7). 
Thus, tumor biopsy will still be key in assessing acquired resistance, 
particularly for novel or nongenetic resistance mechanisms.
In conclusion, direct comparison of cfDNA versus tumor biopsy 
illustrates how single-lesion tumor biopsies in the setting of acquired 
resistance frequently fail to identify the presence of multiple clini-
cally relevant resistance mechanisms, with cfDNA identifying addi-
tional concurrent resistance mechanisms in 78% of cases. Thus, our 
data suggest that single-lesion tumor biopsy alone is inadequate for 
characterizing acquired resistance, and that cfDNA regularly iden-
tifies heterogeneous clinically relevant resistance alterations that 
are critical to the selection of subsequent therapy. This finding has 
important clinical implications: a treatment strategy aiming to over-
come resistance will need to address the fact that a patient probably 
harbors multiple subclones with different resistance mechanisms. 
A recent study showed the effectiveness of cfDNA analysis for select-
ing initial molecularly directed therapy40. Similarly, our results support 
that clinical incorporation of postprogression liquid biopsy may have 
a valuable role in efforts to assess and overcome acquired resistance.

Methods
Patients and specimen collection. All biopsies, tumor specimens and peripheral 
blood draws for plasma isolation were collected in accordance with institutional 
review board-approved protocols. Patients provided written informed consent, 
and all studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Patients provided informed written consent for blood and tissue collection as well 
as for genomic analysis of these specimens. Through a systematic liquid biopsy 
program in the Center for Gastrointestinal Cancers at the Massachusetts General 
Hospital Cancer Center, plasma collection for postprogression cfDNA analysis 
was attempted for all patients receiving targeted therapy for molecularly defined 
gastrointestinal cancer subtypes who achieved radiologic response or stable disease 
between September 2014 and March 2018. In total, 42 patients were studied. 
Peripheral blood was collected in two 10-ml Streck tubes on disease progression 
for cfDNA analysis. When possible, postprogression tumor biopsies (solid and 
blood) were obtained in parallel at the time of progression. These were obtained 
in 23 of the 42 patients. Pretreatment tumor tissue was available for analysis in all 
42 cases, and pretreatment cfDNA was available in 19 cases. Rapid autopsies were 
performed within the first 3 h postmortem. Targeted exome sequencing on clinical 
tissue specimens using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified 
clinical NGS assay was performed in the Department of Molecular Pathology at 
the Massachusetts General Hospital. A subset of patients for whom tumor and 
cfDNA specimens harbored sufficient tumor DNA content were analyzed by WES, 
as described below. Imaging studies, including CT and MRI scans, were obtained 
as part of routine clinical care. A comparator cohort of consecutive gastrointestinal 
cancer patients who did not receive targeted therapy, who underwent clinical 
NGS analysis of cfDNA (Guardant360) as part of routine clinical care after disease 
progression on standard cytotoxic chemotherapy (including patients who received 
antiangiogenic therapy, such as bevacizumab, and two patients with no previous 
therapy), and who had comprehensive baseline clinical tumor NGS testing and 
provided informed written consent as above, were also evaluated.
cfDNA isolation and analysis. Whole blood was collected by routine phlebotomy 
in two 10-ml Streck tubes. Plasma was separated within 1–4 d of collection through 
two different centrifugation steps (the first at room temperature for 10 min at 1,600g 
and the second at 3,000g for the same time and temperature). Plasma was stored at 
−80 °C until cfDNA extraction. cfDNA was extracted from plasma using the QIAamp 
Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Clinical NGS analysis of cfDNA was conducted using the Guardant360 
assay. Peripheral blood was collected in two 10-ml Streck tubes and shipped for 
centralized processing and testing (Guardant Health) in accordance with standard 
clinical testing procedures. Sequencing libraries were prepared from up to 30 ng 
cfDNA with custom in-line barcode molecular tagging, and complete sequencing 
at 15,000× read depth of the critical exons in a targeted panel of 70+ genes was 
performed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified and 
College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratory (Guardant Health)41. 
Targeted NGS of cfDNA for 226 cancer-related genes using the IRCC (Instituto 
per la Ricerca e Cura del Cancro)-Target panel was performed as previously 
reported7,8. To identify candidate mechanisms of acquired resistance, in each case, 
cfDNA sequencing data from plasma obtained postprogression were compared 
with sequencing data from pretreatment tumor or cfDNA, as available, to identify 
emergent alterations not detected in the pretreatment specimens.
For the ddPCR experiments, DNA template (8–10 μl) was added to 10 μl ddPCR 
Supermix for Probes (Bio-Rad) and 2 μl of the custom primer/probe mixture. 
This reaction mix was added to a DG8 cartridge, together with 60 μl Droplet 
Generation Oil for Probes (Bio-Rad), and used for droplet generation. Droplets 
were then transferred to a 96-well plate (Eppendorf) and then thermal cycled 
under the following conditions: 5 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 
1 min and then 98 °C for 10 min (ramp rate: 2 °C s−1). Droplets were analyzed with 
the QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad) for fluorescent measurement of fluorescein 
amidite and hexachloro-fluorescein probes. Gating was performed based on positive 
and negative controls, and mutant populations were identified. The ddPCR data 
were analyzed with QuantaSoft analysis software (Bio-Rad) to obtain fractional 
abundances of the mutant DNA alleles in the wild-type/normal background. The 
quantification of the target molecule was presented as the number of total copies 
(mutant plus wild type) per sample in each reaction. Allelic fractions were calculated 
as follows: allelic fraction (%) = (Nmut/(Nmut + NWT)) × 100), where Nmut is the 
number of mutant alleles and NWT is the number of wild-type alleles per reaction. A 
minimum coverage depth of 300× was achieved for each analysis. ddPCR analysis of 
normal control plasma DNA (from cell lines) and no-DNA template controls were 
always included. Probe and primer sequences are available on request.
WES data. For WES, the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used for dual 
extraction of both genomic DNA and RNA. DNA was quantified in triplicate using 
a standardized PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent (Invitrogen) assay. The 
quality control identification check was performed using fingerprint genotyping of 
95 common single nucleotide polymorphisms by Fluidigm Genotyping (Fluidigm). 
Library construction from double-stranded DNA was performed using the 
KAPA Library Prep Kit with palindromic forked adapters from Integrated DNA 
Technologies. Libraries were pooled before hybridization. Hybridization and 
capture were performed using the relevant components of Illumina’s Rapid Capture 
Enrichment Kit, with a 37-Mb target. All library construction, hybridization 
and capture steps were automated on the Agilent Bravo liquid handling system. 
After postcapture enrichment, library pools were denatured using 0.1 N NaOH 
on the Hamilton STARlet. Cluster amplification of DNA libraries was performed 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina) using HiSeq 4000 exclusion 
amplification chemistry and HiSeq 4000 flow cells. Flow cells were sequenced 
utilizing sequencing-by-synthesis chemistry for HiSeq 4000 flow cells. The flow 
cells were then analyzed using RTA version 2.7.3 or later. Each pool of whole-exome 
libraries was sequenced on paired 76-cycle runs with two eight-cycle index reads 
across the number of lanes needed to meet coverage for all libraries in the pool.
Phylogenetic analysis of multiple samples from the same patient. WES data were 
analyzed on the FireCloud cloud-based analysis platform (https://portal.firecloud.org/). 
Somatic mutations for each tumor/normal pair were detected using the Cancer 
Genome Analysis WES Characterization Pipeline available on FireCloud. The WES 
Characterization Pipeline includes multiple steps, including MuTect42 (for detection 
of somatic single nucleotide variants), Strelka43 (for detecting small insertions and 
deletions), deTiN44 (estimates potential tumor-in-normal contamination), ContEst45 
(for detecting cross-patient contamination), AllelicCapSeg46 (for assessing allele-
specific copy-number alterations) and ABSOLUTE46 (for estimating tumor purity, 
ploidy, absolute allelic copy number and CCFs). The data for this study consisted of 
multiple samples collected from each patient (pre- and post-treatment), as well as 
autopsy samples. Phylogenetic analysis, subclonal reconstruction and tree building 
were done with the PhylogicNDT package36.
Tumor clustering based on patterns of commonly acquired alterations. To 
better characterize patients with an unknown mechanism of resistance, we wanted 
to identify groups of patients that share similar patterns of alterations that were 
acquired between the pretreatment and postprogression samples. We define, for 
each patient with pre- and post-treatment samples, a set of features that reflect the 
changes in their somatic alterations between the pretreatment and postprogression 
samples, which we call δ (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We focused the analysis on either 
a list of 609 known cancer genes (Cancer Gene Census; downloaded October 
2017) or a set of 5,144 genesets (MSigDB classes c2.cp and c5.bp; version 6 with at 
most 200 genes). We considered both point mutations (somatic single nucleotide 
variants, and insertions and deletions) and somatic copy-number alterations. 
When analyzing point mutations, we set δgene = 1 to reflect a significant change in 
CCF (that is, a change in CCF of the mutation in the gene of at least two standard 
deviations above the mean CCF change across all mutations, and a postprogression 
sample with a CCF > 0.2). Similarly, when analyzing copy number, we set δgene = 1 
to reflect a significant copy-number change (that is, a change greater than two 
standard deviations above or below the mean change in copy-number levels, 
and amplification (copy-number level > 4) or deletion of the gene (copy-number 
level < 1) in the postprogression sample, respectively). To study genesets, we set 
δgeneset to reflect the fraction of genes in the geneset that have a significant change in 
either copy number or mutation CCF, accounting for the size of the geneset and the 
total number of significant genes in the patient.
Next, to find groups of patients that have similar changes in their somatic 
alterations, we applied the BiMax biclustering algorithm47 to each of the four δ 
matrices (δcopy number
cancer gene , δmutation
geneset , δcopy number
geneset
 and δcopy number and mutation
geneset
). This analysis 
yielded between three and 11 biclusters (Extended Data Figs. 3b–e). To evaluate the 
significance of the resulting biclusters, we used a two-sided t-test to compare the 
mean size of biclusters observed in the matrix against the results from n = 10,000 
permuted matrices, where the values of the matrix were shuffled and biclustered.

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Patients with multiple postprogression tumor biopsies. Three of five patients with multiple postprogression tumor biopsies are 
shown. The other two patients (TPS037 and TPS177) are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. For each patient, the location of each tumor biopsy, as well 
as the resistance alterations (blue) and truncal alterations (orange) detected in cfDNA and in each tumor specimen, are shown. TPS001 is a patient with 
RAS wild type colorectal cancer who developed resistance to an anti-EGFR antibody8. Biopsy of one liver lesion revealed an activating MEK1 (MAP2K1) 
mutation, and biopsy of a second liver lesion identified a KRAS mutation. Both resistance alterations were detected in postprogression cfDNA. TPS007 
is an FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma patient who developed resistance to an FGFR inhibitor5. Five FGFR2 resistance mutations were identified 
in postprogression cfDNA, and three of these alterations were identified in distinct liver lesions harvested through a rapid autopsy program, with one 
lesion harboring two FGFR2 alterations. TPS011 is a patient with RAS wild type colorectal cancer who developed resistance to an anti-EGFR antibody. A 
recurrent colon tumor harbored a KRAS mutation, and an EGFR extracellular domain mutation known to interfere with antibody binding was identified in an 
ovarian metastasis, whereas both alterations were detected in cfDNA. Importantly, in all patients, individual resistance mechanisms emerging in distinct 
metastatic lesions were detectable in cfDNA.

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Biclusters of patients based on similar changes (δ) in somatic alteration. Biclustering of four δ matrices, reflecting changes 
in CCF of mutations or copy number in known cancer genes or genesets, yielded significant biclusters (all empirical P values < 0.0001; Methods). The 
biclusters from all four δ matrices included at least one bicluster with patient TPS130 (a patient with an unknown mechanism of resistance). Patient 
TPS130 consistently biclustered together with TPS021 and TPS037 (patients with known mechanisms of resistance) across all matrices, highlighting the 
possibility that additional genomic alterations contribute to resistance beyond the identified resistance alterations. a, The change in somatic alterations, δ, 
was calculated based on WES data of the samples closest to the start and end of therapy. We biclustered four δ matrices (δcopy number
cancer gene , δmutation
geneset , δcopy number
geneset
 
and δcopy number and mutation
geneset
) and assessed their significance by comparing the size of biclusters against n = 10,000 permuted matrices with a two-sided t-test
