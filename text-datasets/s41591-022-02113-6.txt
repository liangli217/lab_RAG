Evolutionary history of transformation 
from chronic lymphocytic leukemia to 
Richter syndrome
Richter syndrome (RS) arising from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
exemplifies an aggressive malignancy that develops from an indolent 
neoplasm. To decipher the genetics underlying this transformation, we 
computationally deconvoluted admixtures of CLL and RS cells from 52 
patients with RS, evaluating paired CLL–RS whole-exome sequencing 
data. We discovered RS-specific somatic driver mutations (including 
IRF2BP2, SRSF1, B2M, DNMT3A and CCND3), recurrent copy-number 
alterations beyond del(9p21)(CDKN2A/B), whole-genome duplication and 
chromothripsis, which were confirmed in 45 independent RS cases and in 
an external set of RS whole genomes. Through unsupervised clustering, 
clonally related RS was largely distinct from diffuse large B cell lymphoma. 
We distinguished pathways that were dysregulated in RS versus CLL, and 
detected clonal evolution of transformation at single-cell resolution, 
identifying intermediate cell states. Our study defines distinct molecular 
subtypes of RS and highlights cell-free DNA analysis as a potential tool for 
early diagnosis and monitoring.
Transformation to a high-grade malignancy accounts for therapeu-
tic resistance and rapid disease progression across cancers1–3. RS, an 
aggressive lymphoma developing in patients with CLL, is a striking 
example of transformation3. RS is associated with median overall sur-
vival of less than 1 year, even in the modern era3. Despite advanced 
genomic characterization of CLL4,5,6, understanding of the genetic 
factors driving the evolution of CLL to RS remains limited. This is partly 
because of the difficulties in acquiring RS tissue and paired antecedent 
CLL cells. These challenges have precluded comparative evolutionary 
analysis, and limited the ability to define the molecular events under-
lying transformation beyond alterations in TP53, NOTCH1, CDKN2A/B 
and MYC7–10. Although a subset of RS is believed to be clonally unre-
lated based on immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) sequencing3,10, 
a genome-wide analysis to exclude shared ancestry has not been yet 
performed. Finally, RS biopsies contain admixtures of RS and CLL cells, 
mandating development of tools for in silico deconvolution of RS and 
CLL genetic changes. To delineate factors contributing to high-grade 
transformation definitively, we analyzed exomes from matched RS 
and CLL DNA from 52 patients and confirmed our findings in 45 inde-
pendent RS patients and 14 external RS cases9.
Results
Developing an analytic framework to discover RS drivers
We assembled a discovery cohort of 53 patients with paired CLL and RS 
samples of predominantly diffuse large B cell histology (DLBCL), the 
most common form of transformation3 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary 
Tables 1 and 2). Forty-five (83%) patients received previous CLL-directed 
therapies, with 11 (21%) having received targeted agents. Thirty-nine 
(72%) patients had unmutated IGHV CLL (U-CLL). Whole-exome 
sequencing (WES) was completed for 186 DNA samples (from 
53 patients) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for 30 samples 
(11 patients; Supplementary Table 3). WES data from 42 patients 
originated from matched CLL–RS–germline samples (trios) and 10 
from paired CLL–RS (duos). As validation, we performed WES on 
45 independent RS cases, 17 of which were duos (Fig. 1b and Supple-
mentary Table 1–3).

These tools were applied to infer the CLL and RS clonal structure 
and relatedness (Extended Data Figs. 1d, 2 and 3 and Supplementary 
Figs. 1 and 2). We identified instances of clonal unrelatedness to the 
antecedent CLL (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2), previously classi-
fied based on IGHV sequencing in ~20% of RS3,10. Most RS were clonally 
related to the antecedent CLL (n = 45, 87%; Fig. 1f). Evolutionary rela-
tionships were secondarily determined by comparing the immuno-
globulin gene sequence (Supplementary Table 4), largely in line with 
the WES-based phylogenies.
Defining the genomic landscape of RS
To determine the pure RS genomic landscape, we identified: (1) events 
strictly present in RS cells through computational isolation of the RS 
To delineate the driver events giving rise to RS, we employed estab-
lished WES analysis tools and three additional steps: (1) deTiN11 to 
recover somatic mutations filtered due to tumor-in-normal contamina-
tion, (2) an optimized tool to detect somatic copy-number alterations 
(sCNAs) and (3) PhylogicNDT12 to establish the clonal composition per 
patient sample and infer the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1c and Extended 
Data Fig. 1a–c). RS clones were defined as new clones arising in the RS 
sample, not present in the antecedent CLL sample and distinct based 
on somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) and sCNAs. Within the 
CLL compartment, phylogenetic trees identified the ancestral (CLLANC), 
intermediate (CLLINT, which expanded to give rise to RS that arose from 
CLLANC) and divergent (CLLDIV) clones (Fig. 1d). RS was identified as 
related to CLL if at least one common CLLANC clone was shared.

lineage separate from CLLDIV (Fig. 2a, grey outline), and (2) events newly 
acquired in RS clones (Fig. 2a, magenta outline). To uncover drivers 
of transformation, we applied MutSig2CV13 and GISTIC2.0 (ref. 14) 
(Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Table 5, Methods).
From our discovery cohort, we observed mutations in known CLL 
drivers (NOTCH1, TP53 and SF3B1; Fig. 2b) and identified new candidate 
RS drivers (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 4a–x). These included 
mutations in IRF2BP2 (n = 7), which encodes an IRF2-dependent tran-
scriptional corepressor, which is mutated in the N1 subtype of DLBCL15 
and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma16 (Extended Data Fig. 4d). 
Inactivating mutations in the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A (8%) 
were previously reported as a single case in RS8; genetically engineered 
mice modeling this alteration have confirmed its CLL-driving func-
tion and impact on Notch signaling17,18 (Extended Data Fig. 4e). B2M 
loss through inactivating mutations, a mechanism of immune escape 
across cancers19–22, was observed in three patients (Extended Data 
Fig. 4f). The detected mutations in the MYC-interacting23 splicing 
factor SRSF1 (n = 4) did not co-occur with mutated SF3B1, consistent 
with mutual exclusivity of splicing factor mutations across cancers24 
(Extended Data Fig. 4g). EZH2 hotspot alterations were found in two 
clonally unrelated RS cases, as in DLBCL15,19, whereas EZH2 frameshift 
was seen in one related RS case (Extended Data Fig. 4h).
Strikingly, we detected numerous sCNAs (Fig. 2b–d and Extended 
Data Fig. 5a,b; Methods), including del(17p) (TP53, 63%) and del(9p21.3) 
(CDKN2A/B, 19%), with arm-level loss of 9p in five additional patients. 
Recurrent focal events beyond common CLL drivers included 
del(15q13.1l) (MGA and B2M, 21%), amplification (amp) of chromosome 
8q24 (MYC, 15%), del(7q36) (EZH2, POT1, KMT2C 11.5%) and amp(13q31.2) 
(ERCC5, miR-17-92 12%), which have been described in high-risk CLL25. 
Changes not previously reported in CLL or RS included amp(9p24) 
(PDL1/L2, 8%), del(16q12) (11.5%), del(18q22) (8%) and amp(7q21.2) 
(CDK6, 11.5%), del(1p), amp(11q) (POU2AF1, SDHD) and amp(1q23). 
Whole-genome doubling (WGD) was noted in 15% of cases (Extended 
Data Figs. 2 and 3). The recurrent RS-specific gene mutations, sCNAs 
and WGD were confirmed in our validation cohort (n = 45; Fig. 2b, 
right bar, Supplementary Table 5 and Extended Data Fig. 4a–x) and 
14 external RS genomes9 (Extended Data Fig. 4a–x and Supplementary 
Table 5).
Combined analysis of our discovery and validation cohorts pro-
vided power to detect new RS drivers further, with CCND3, TET2 and 
BRAF mutations and additional focal sCNAs emerging as significant 
(Extended Data Fig. 4v–x and Fig. 2d). Comparison of our 45 clonally 
related cases with prior large-scale CLL analyses6 revealed predis-
posing lesions for RS, given their relative enrichment in CLLANC + INT, 
including mutated TP53 and NOTCH1, del(17p) and del(14q32) but not 
tri(12), mut-SF3B1 or del(11q) (all Q < 0.05; Fig. 2e and Supplementary 
Table 5). Compared to DLBCL15,19, the driver distribution in these 45 
cases was enriched for TP53, del(17p), NOTCH1, del(13q14.2), del(1p), 
amp(19p13.2), SF3B1, EGR2 and GNB1 (Fig. 2f, all Q < 0.05). Mut-IRF2BP2, 
-MGA and -DNMT3A frequency was higher in RS compared to 304 
de novo DLBCLs19.
Evaluation of the relative timing of each putative driver event in 
58 related RS cases revealed ATM mutations, tri(12) mutations or SF3B1 
mutations, as already present in CLLANC; alterations in TP53 (mutations 
and/or del(17p)) or NOTCH1 and del(15q15.1) [MGA] were predominantly 
CLL events (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table 6). In contrast, del(9p21), 
del(9p), del(9q), del(2q37), amp(1q23) and del(6q) were most frequently 
observed as new RS events (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table 6); WGD 
was restricted to the RS clones (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3 and 
Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). By systematically identifying preferred 
genomic trajectories driving transformation, we calculated the prob-
ability for acquiring any of the RS drivers per CLL driver via network 
analysis (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Table 6). Significant trajectories 
from CLL to RS included NOTCH1 to del(1p), NOTCH1 to del(14q32) and 
del(14q32) to amp(16q23) (P < 0.05; Q < 0.4).
Overall, our findings indicate mutations of NOTCH1, DNA damage 
response and the MAPK pathway as preexisting in CLL, and alterations 
in epigenetics, interferon/inflammatory signaling, cell-cycle deregula-
tion and immune evasion—whether by sSNVs or by sCNAs—as newly 
occurring at transformation (Fig. 3a).
Profiling RS emerging following targeted therapies
Therapies targeting BTK, BCL2 or PI3K-delta pathways have revolution-
ized CLL therapy and yet have failed to prevent transformation. Since RS 
is a recognized mechanism of therapeutic resistance26–28, we evaluated 
the 15 patients within our cohort presenting transformation to RS while 
receiving targeted agents. No typical resistance mutations to targeted 
agents were detected (BTK, BCL2), while one ibrutinib-exposed patient 
had del(8p) and one venetoclax-treated patient had amp(1q), both 
previously described sCNA drivers of resistance29,30 (Fig. 3b)
To track disease tempo over time, we analyzed serial samples 
procured in the years before RS from two patients receiving targeted 
agents. Patient 26 illustrates the potential impact of EZH2 inactivation 
to transformation while on venetoclax, since the RS specimen carried 
both an inactivating EZH2 frameshift mutation and deletion of the 
EZH2 locus through del(7q36) (Fig. 3c). Patient 3 developed nodal RS 
that evolved from TP53-mutated CLL while on ibrutinib. The RS clone 
emerged from an aggressive CLL subclone (clone 3) marked by focal 
loss of the CDKN2A/B locus (Fig. 3d). Newly acquired genetic changes 
in the RS clone included inactivating mutations in chromatin modifiers 
(CHD2, SRSF1), NFKBIE and del(15q15) (MGA loss). Transformation on 
targeted agents appears as an heterogenous process, distinct from 
acquired resistance in CLL and characterized by complex evolution 
marked by accumulation of multiple events.
RS is characterized by distinct molecular subtypes
To assess the degree of similarity between RS and DLBCL, we performed 
unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), clustering on 
our 97 RS cases along with 304 DLBCL samples19 based on our identi-
fied RS genetic alterations together with known DLBCL drivers. Most 
RS (75 of 97 cases) clustered together, largely separately from DLBCL 
(Extended Data Fig. 5c). The DLBCL cases closest to RS comprised 
DLBCL C2, previously reported with biallelic TP53 inactivation, fre-
quent CDKN2A/B loss and del(13q14) (Rb1)19. Seven of eight clonally 
unrelated RS clustered with DLBCL (Fisher’s exact test, P = 6.75 × 10−6), 
with membership across the DLBCL clusters19, highlighting unrelated 
RS as a diverse entity genetically similar to de novo DLBCL.
Analysis of the combined RS validation and discovery WES data by 
unbiased NMF consensus clustering defined five RS molecular subtypes 
(Extended Data Fig. 5d). Three (RS1, RS3 and RS5) were enriched in 
TP53 and/or del(17p) and displayed higher rates of sCNAs and genome 
alterations (Fig. 4a). RS1 (13.4%) was marked by WGD and fractured 
genomes (P < 0.001 Supplementary Table 7f; Methods), along with 
arm-level loss of 1p and 9p and MYC amplification. It comprised 6 of 15 
M-CLL patients, highlighting WGD as a mechanism of transformation in 
M-CLL (Fisher’s exact test, P = 4.6 × 10−3). RS3 (20.6%) was enriched for 
del(17p) and mutations in TP53, NOTCH1 and IRF2BP2, and frequently 
contained sCNAs, including del(14q32.11), del(9q), del(15q15.2) (MGA), 
amp(16q23.2) (IRF8) and del(2q37.1). RS5 (22.7%) similarly displayed 
high rates of del(17p) and TP53 alterations and frequent sCNAs, includ-
ing del(16q12.1), del(1p35.2) and amp(7p), but lacked NOTCH1 mutation. 
By contrast, subtypes RS2 and RS4 showed lower fraction of genome 
altered (P < 0.001 (RS2 versus 1, 3 and 5); P < 0.005 (RS4 versus 1, 3 and 5); 
Supplementary Table 7). RS2 (26.8%) was predominantly marked by 
tri(12) co-occurring with SPEN/NOTCH1 and KRAS mutations. RS4 
(16.5%) was marked by SF3B1 and EGR2 mutations on a background 
of del(13q).
Evaluation of differential expression between subtypes from 
matched transcriptomes from 36 RS cases identified distinct signatures 
defining RS1 (n = 25 genes) and RS3 (n = 188; Extended Data Fig. 6a and

Fig. 4 | Molecular mechanisms underlying transformation to RS. a, Genomic 
classification of RS. For 97 patients (columns), five patterns of RS identified by 
consensus NMF clustering are depicted, with respective somatic mutations and 
copy-number alterations (rows). Samples are annotated for prior treatments 
(chemoimmunotherapy, light green; targeted agent, dark green; no prior 
therapy, white); IGHV status (mutated, brown; unmutated, beige; white, not 
determined); clonal relatedness (related, gray; unrelated, black; unknown by 
WES, white); and the presence of WGD (gray). Fraction genome altered per 
sample is shown (top). Event frequencies are indicated as blue bars on the right 
side for each alteration. Genes that met significance for association with a 
cluster by Fisher’s exact test (Supplementary Table 7) are highlighted by cluster 
association (subtype 1, purple; subtype 2, blue; subtype 3, orange; subtype 4, 
green; subtype 5, red). b, Overall survival according to the RS genomic pattern.

Supplementary Table 8). RS3 displayed signatures of cell-cycle and 
inflammatory/interferon signaling processes in line with its enrichment 
for IRF2BP2 mutations (Supplementary Table 8). Unsupervised consen-
sus clustering identified five transcriptional clusters that associated 
with RS molecular subtypes (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.038; Extended 
Data Fig. 6b,c). RS2 and RS4 associated with improved overall survival 
(log-rank P = 0.0082; Fig. 4b). Clonally related cases had shorter median 
OS than unrelated ones (log-rank P = 0.0094; Extended Data Fig. 6d).
Mutational processes underlying transformation
Evaluation of mutational profiles from the combined CLL and RS WES 
data revealed signatures of aging and activation-induced cytidine 
deaminase (AID), like previous studies5,6,31. We detected a dominant 
signature of polymerase epsilon (POLE) mutation in an unrelated RS 
case (patient 30), with deleterious POLE mutation and more than 2,000 
sSNVs (Fig. 4c). We further analyzed WGS generated from 11 RS trios, 
since WGS-determined phylogenetic trees improved resolution of 
clones; these remained concordant with the WES phylogenies, as pre-
viously reported32 (Extended Data Fig. 7a). CLL and RS clones of the 
two unrelated RS cases did not share a distant non-coding evolution-
ary history, definitively establishing them as unrelated malignancies 
(Extended Data Fig. 7b). Of 14 external WGS RS cases9, two were clonally 
unrelated cases (Extended Data Fig. 7c and Supplementary Table 7). 
Mutational analysis of the CLL clones from 10 of 11 evaluable patients 
revealed signatures similar to the WES analysis (Fig. 4c). However, the 
RS clones revealed expanded mutational signatures, including prior 
chemotherapy (SBS17b), reactive oxygen species (SBS18) and defec-
tive DNA mismatch repair (SBS44, as previously reported9). Kataegis 
was recently reported in RS9, and we indeed identified this across 
4 of 11 RS genomes with clustered AID-related mutations (Fig. 4d,e and 
Supplementary Table 7).
From the WGS samples, we observed chromothripsis as a common 
defining feature of TP53-altered RS genomes (Fig. 4f and Extended 
Data Fig. 8a). Chromothripsis was detected in regions likely contrib-
uting to RS pathogenesis, including 7q21 (CDK6) (patient 41), 11q13 
(CCND1) (patient 29) and 9p24.1 (PDL1/L2) (patient 41); most regions 
were patient specific (Extended Data Fig. 8b).
Dynamics of transformation at single-cell resolution
We identified 292 upregulated and 111 downregulated transcripts 
associated with transformation from analysis of bulk RNA-seq data 
generated from paired high-purity RS and CLL RNA (n = 5; log2 |FC| > 1 
(where FC denotes fold change), adjusted P < 0.05; Fig. 5a,b and Sup-
plementary Table 9). The larger RS cells contained more expressed 
transcripts and at higher abundances. Their most upregulated tran-
scripts included regulators of mitosis, spindle assembly and cytokinesis 
(AURKA, AURKB, CDK1 and CDK2), activation-induced cytidine deami-
nase (AIDCA) and DNA repair regulators (BRCA1 and XRCC2; Fig. 5b 
and Supplementary Table 9). Overexpression of several of these genes 
has been implicated in aneuploidy in cancer33. By contrast, CLL showed 
higher relative expression of BCR signaling pathway genes.
To examine CLL transforming to RS at high resolution, we per-
formed scRNA-seq of flow cytometry-sorted RS diagnosis biopsy speci-
mens from five additional patients that contained clonally related RS 
and CLL cells within the same microenvironment (Fig. 5c and Extended 
Data Fig. 9a,b). Given the numerous RS-defining sCNAs in our WES 
data, we devised a tool, CNVSingle, to identify the expression clus-
ters representing RS versus CLL clones based on detection of sCNA 
events in scRNA-seq data. CNVSingle is not dominated by reference, 
but rather utilizes segmentation of SNP-heterozygous sites to infer 
the sCNAs across a cluster of cells. This approach greatly improved 
the signal-to-noise ratio over other methods34 and robustly detected 
tumor-specific sCNAs in malignant cells, with additional events in 
clusters of RS cells compared to those of CLL, and the absence of sCNAs 
in normal immune cells (Extended Data Fig. 9c).
Compared to CLL, the RS-identified clones across the evaluated 
patient samples displayed a higher number of unique molecular iden-
tifiers (UMI) per cell (that is, mean 9,000 versus 3,193 for patient 43; 
P < 10−14, Wilcoxon) and genes/cell (mean 2,909 versus 1,074; P < 10−14; 
Extended Data Fig. 9d). Differential expression analyses of the RS 
versus CLL clusters showed enrichment in pathways mapping to MYC 
targets, cell cycle, inflammatory response and STAT signaling pathways 
(Supplementary Table 9). Directional trajectories inferred using RNA 
velocity35 supported a transition in cell states from CLL to RS (Extended 
Data Fig. 9e). The expression patterns in CLL and RS cells were suffi-
ciently distinct that a random forest classifier could predict CLL versus 
RS identity of individual cells (mean F1 ± σ = 0.92 ± 0.01; Methods).
Strikingly, sCNA assignments mapped to transcriptionally identi-
fied cell populations. For example, the LN cells of patient 43 (RS5 sub-
type) formed two groups of clusters consistent with CLL and RS (Fig. 5d, 
top middle). CLL cluster 2 exhibited gene expression intermediate 
between cluster 1 and the RS clusters, including an increase in cell-cycle 
genes (Fig. 5d, top right). Accordingly, the copy-number profile of 
cluster 1 resembled the quieter CLLANC clone in WES (green), while 
cluster 2 showed acquisition of sCNAs of the CLLINT clone in WES (light 
blue) that subsequently gave rise to RS. RS clusters (3 and 4) displayed 
additional sCNAs, consistent with the chromothripsis seen in WES 
analysis (that is, sCNAs on chromosome 2 followed by 7, 8 and 9 with 
regional fragmentation; Extended Data Fig. 9f, top). Thus, intranodal 
cells reside on a genetic and transcriptional continuum from indolent 
to aggressive CLL toward RS.
Patient 10 (RS1) highlighted the rapid evolution of transformation 
with genomic instability in M-CLL. WES analysis established the lack 
of sCNAs in circulating CLL before transformation, in contrast to the 
abundant sCNAs and WGD in RS cells. WES of peripheral blood CLL at 
the time of RS diagnosis revealed new WGD but with fewer sCNAs than 
the LN RS WES. By flow cytometry of the LN at RS diagnosis, both CLL 
and RS cells were detected (Extended Data Fig. 9a, right); single-cell 
transcriptomes yielded three distinct populations. Cluster 1 displayed 
gene counts per cell consistent with CLL, whereas cluster 3 expressed 
much higher numbers of genes, in line with RS (Extended Data Fig. 9d); 
cluster 2 showed an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 5e, top). Cluster 1 
demonstrated both del(17p) and WGD, matching the WES profile of the 
circulating CLL at the time of RS. Cluster 2 showed progressive genomic 
disorder followed by cluster 3, which highly resembled the CN profile of 
RS as per WES, with further sCNAs and fragmentation on chromosome 
9. Therefore, in this case, del(17p) and WGD in an aggressive CLL clone 
preceded the RS transition, marked by subsequent global copy-number 
shifts and chromothripsis; these observations delineate the stepwise 
sequence of events leading to RS.
For patient 4, few RS cells were captured, but WGD and frequent 
sCNAs were nonetheless observed, again demonstrating the genome 
disorder of the RS1 subtype (Extended Data Fig. 10a). For patient 18 
(RS2), clustering identified distinct early RS (clusters 3 and 4) from an 
RS subclone (cluster 0) containing del(6) that had been seen by WES 
(Extended Data Fig. 10b). Patient 41 (RS1) highlighted an intermedi-
ate cell state clearly residing within the coexisting forward scatter 
(FSC)-low CLL population (Extended Data Fig. 9b,d and Supplementary 
Table 8). Indeed, per CNVSingle, the intermediate state cells showed 
acquisition of early RS-specific events (that is, del(3p), del(4) and

Early RS clones are detectable in cell-free DNA
Given the numerous RS-associated genomic features, we assessed 
the feasibility of noninvasive detection of RS events through cell-free 
DNA (cfDNA) (Fig. 6a). We evaluated 46 plasma samples by ultralow 
pass WGS36 collected from 24 patients within 3 years of RS diagno-
sis and through relapse (Supplementary Table 10). Samples from 17 
patients were collected at the time of RS disease, including eight at

initial diagnosis. Ten were from the discovery cohort, and their RS char-
acterization served as positive confirmation for detection of RS-specific 
alterations. Eight of these also had simultaneous (same blood draw) or 
contemporaneous circulating CLL cells analyzed by WES, thus offering 
a controlled way to evaluate the differing contributions of nodal versus 
circulating disease, since the cfDNA includes DNA shed from both LN 
and circulating CLL cells.
RS-associated genomic features were indeed detectable in plasma. 
WGD was observed in the cfDNA of patient 38 at the time of RS diag-
nosis, matching the RS WES profile, whereas circulating CLL remained

diploid (Fig. 6b). The cfDNA of patient 44 revealed RS-associated sCNAs 
(del(9p), amp(13)) that were not in the CLL cells (Extended Data Fig. 
10d). cfDNA analysis also highlighted RS emergence during therapy in 
a high-risk CLL patient with del(17p) (patient 99). Although the cfDNA 
profile at the start of CLL-directed therapy showed minimal sCNAs, 
the profile at the time of RS diagnosis showed abundant new sCNAs, 
including amp(8q24) (MYC) (Extended Data Fig. 10e). In other patients, 
chromothripsis was evident in plasma cfDNA (Fig. 6c and Extended 
Data Fig. 10f). Furthermore, for all of the four cases from our discovery 
cohort in which WES was additionally performed on cfDNA, RS-specific 
mutations were detected (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 10g).
We queried whether RS changes could be detected in cfDNA in 
advance of RS diagnosis. For two of seven patients whose plasma was 
collected 1–10 months before RS diagnosis (Supplementary Table 10), 
we could detect RS-associated alterations in the cfDNA, during which 
time they were undergoing therapies for presumed refractory CLL. 
In patient 5, WGD and chromothripsis (chr 6 and 16) were detected in 
plasma 162 days before diagnosis and were absent from CLL (Fig. 6e, 
left). WES of cfDNA (Extended Data Fig. 10g) further showed the pres-
ence of RS-specific mutations. In patient 20, cfDNA 181 days before RS 
diagnosis showed WGD and sCNAs not present in the corresponding 
CLL blood sample (day −179) or LN biopsy (CLL) from the prior week 
(Fig. 6e, right).
Finally, we probed the potential for cfDNA analysis to detect early 
RS relapse. We considered two patients who had achieved a state of 
minimal CLL involvement following allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell 
transplantation (HSCT) but who subsequently relapsed with nodal RS. 
For patient 112, cfDNA obtained immediately following HSCT lacked 
evidence of RS events, but by days +83 and +162, new sCNAs, and thus 
increased fraction genome altered (FGA), were found, consistent with 
nodal disease emergence (Fig. 6f). Ultimately, biopsy-confirmed RS 
relapse was diagnosed on day +187. With subsequent RS response, 
the RS-associated cfDNA changes resolved. Patient 111 intermittently 
had elevated FGA in plasma following HSCT, before RS diagnosis, 
which resolved following RS therapy (Supplementary Table 10). Across 
samples, the highest levels of FGA in cfDNA were observed in RS diag-
nostic samples (n = 8), with a decreasing ratio in the preceding 1–10 
months (n = 7) and an even lower ratio in more distant prediagnosis 
samples (>10 months; n = 4). In seven cases, FGA exceeded all values 
from high-risk CLL cases (n = 14 samples from five patients; Fig. 6g). Of 
the eight patients with cfDNA available at the time of biopsy-proven 
RS diagnosis, we confidently discerned RS-specific lesions in six (75%) 
using strict criteria.
Discussion
For decades, the RS diagnosis has relied on morphologic characteriza-
tion of aggressive lymphoma within the context of concurrent or known 
history of CLL3. Herein, through the implementation of advanced ana-
lytic approaches that can distinguish between the RS and CLL clones, and 
through integration of exome, genome and transcriptome data to the 
largest series of paired CLL and RS specimens to date, we have defined 
the distinct molecular events that precede and define the RS transition.
Of the new insights gained from this study, one was the identifica-
tion of new putative driving events in RS, distinct from CLL, affecting 
splicing, immune evasion, epigenetics, cell-cycle regulation, interferon 
signaling and MYC signaling. Epigenetic remodeling has been detected 
in RS, impacting pathways of BCR signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, 
cell proliferation and MYC signaling37. We further identified instances 
of driver alterations with potential therapeutic impact, such as those 
affecting CDK6 or immune checkpoints. Our study highlights major dif-
ferences between RS and de novo DLBCL, despite several shared driver 
events. We delineated five RS subtypes and confirmed these genomic 
patterns associated with distinct transcriptomes and outcome.
Second, RS is marked by numerous sCNAs and features of genomic 
instability (that is, chromothripsis, kataegis and WGD). Near tetraploidy 
has been identified as an RS risk factor38, and our detailed genomic and 
single-cell analysis demonstrates how this unstable state can lead 
to RS evolution. These features could result from mitosis defects, 
as suggested by RNA expression data, and WGD may confer potential 
therapeutic vulnerabilities39. We demonstrate how such instability 
may be used to provide an earlier and noninvasive detection of 
RS in cfDNA, which should be further evaluated in clinical studies 
as a cost-effective approach for this difficult-to-diagnose aggressive 
cancer40.
Finally, we confirmed the majority of RS is unrelated to the 
co-occurring CLL—a facet previously only defined based on differ-
ing IGHV clonotypes3,10 and ultradeep IGHV sequencing41. Unrelated 
RS has been previously associated with improved clinical outcomes, 
which suggests distinct disease biology3,10. We now demonstrate that 
by exome-level or genome-level analysis, clonally unrelated RS is a 
de novo DLBCL, occurring as an independent lymphoma, lacking any 
shared distant genetic history with the coexisting CLL. These cases 
tended to lack TP53 and NOTCH1 alterations, were enriched in M-CLL 
and clustered with de novo DLBCL separately from clonally related RS. 
These molecular insights may help identify RS patients with a more 
favorable prognosis.
Altogether, our comprehensive evolutionary tracing enables a 
molecular definition of transformation that can guide the identifica-
tion, diagnosis and prognosis of RS. Our advanced molecular frame-
work can serve as a model for studying transformed cancers.

Methods
Patient sample collection and processing
CLL, RS and normal germline (that is, nontumor) samples were col-
lected from patients following written informed consent through 
sample collection protocols or from clinical trial NCT03619512 from 
the French Innovative Leukemia Organization (FILO) with the approval 
of the following Institutional Review Boards (IRBs): Dana-Farber Can-
cer Institute IRB, University of California San Diego IRB, Mayo Clinic 
IRB, MD Anderson Cancer Center IRB, Ethics Committee of Ulm Uni-
versity (Ulm, Germany) or the University Hospital of Nancy with the 
approval of the Comité de Protection des personnes (CPP) Ouest IV 
(Nantes, France). All biospecimen collection protocols were conducted 
in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and 
with the approval of the IRBs of the respective institutions. Patient and 
sample characteristics are provided (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). 
Sex was self-reported.
RS samples. RS samples were collected from BM, LN, lymphoid tissue 
or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and included both 
fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. 
Freshly collected tissue samples were disaggregated by GentleMACs 
digestion (Miltenyi Biotec) before cryopreservation with FBS/10% 
DMSO and storage in liquid nitrogen or directly stored as whole tissue 
blocks in liquid nitrogen. Blood and BM specimens were isolated by 
Ficoll/Hypaque density gradient centrifugation before cryopreserva-
tion with FBS/10% DMSO and storage in liquid nitrogen. For viably fro-
zen samples of low purity (<30% tumor), RS cells were isolated by FACS 
(Aria II; Becton Dickinson) based on CD5+ and CD19+ co-expression on 
cells with increased FSC (Biolegend; CD5 FITC catalog no. 364022, CD19 
PE-Cy7 catalog no. 302216). For FFPE specimens, samples from each 
submitting center were reviewed for >50% purity before sequencing.
CLL samples. CLL samples were obtained from PBMCs. Samples with 
higher CLL purity (white blood cell count > 25 × 103 cells µl−1 or abso-
lute lymphocyte count > 20 × 103 cells µl−1) were processed without 
CD19 selection, and PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll/Hypaque density 
gradient centrifugation and then cryopreserved with FBS/10% DMSO 
and stored in liquid nitrogen until the time of analysis. Samples with 
a white blood cell count < 25,000 cells µl−1 or an absolute lympho-
cyte count < 20,000 cells µl−1 underwent CD19 selection (RosetteSep 
Human B cell enrichment; Stem Cell Technologies) or as previously 
described4 or FACS sorting to enrich for CD5+CD19+ populations.
Germline samples. Sources of nontumor germline DNA included 
saliva (Oragene Discover (ORG500 or ORG600) kit; DNA Genotek), 
remission BM4 or in vitro expanded T cells. For the latter, CD19−CD4+ or 
CD19−CD3+ cells were collected by FACS (Aria II; Becton Dickinson; Bio-
legend, catalog no. 300330, catalog no. 300506, catalog no. 363006). 
The cells were plated and expanded in vitro in RPMI (Gibco) containing 
phytohemagglutinin (1.5:100), IL-7 (20 ng ml−1), IL-2 (100 U ml−1), 10% 
human serum and β-2-mercaptoethanol (1/1,000).
Genomic DNA sequencing
WES. A total of 143 samples were processed and sequenced at the 
Broad Institute. For these fresh blood and BM samples and cryopre-
served suspension cells, genomic DNA and RNA were extracted per 
the manufacturer’s recommendations (Qiagen). DNA was quantified 
in triplicate using a standardized PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Rea-
gent (Invitrogen) assay. The quality control identification check was 
performed using fingerprint genotyping of 95 common SNPs by Fluid-
igm Genotyping. Library construction from double-stranded DNA was 
performed using the KAPA Library Prep kit, with palindromic forked 
adapters from Integrated DNA Technologies. Libraries were pooled 
before hybridization. Hybridization and capture were performed using 
the relevant components of Illumina’s Rapid Capture Enrichment Kit, 
with a 37-Mb target. All library construction, hybridization and capture 
steps were automated on the Agilent Bravo liquid handling system. 
After post-capture enrichment, library pools were denatured using 
0.1 N NaOH on the Hamilton Starlet. Cluster amplification of DNA librar-
ies was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina) 
using HiSeq 4000 exclusion amplification chemistry and HiSeq 4000 
flow cells. Flow cells were sequenced utilizing Sequencing-by-Synthesis 
chemistry for HiSeq 4000 flow cells. The flow cells were then ana-
lyzed using RTA v.2.7.3 or later. Each pool of whole-exome libraries was 
sequenced on paired 76 cycle runs with two eight-cycle index reads 
across the number of lanes needed to meet coverage for all libraries in 
the pool. Output from Illumina software was processed by the Picard 
data-processing pipeline to yield BAM files containing demultiplexed, 
aggregated aligned reads. Standard quality control metrics, including 
error rates, percentage-passing filter reads and total Gb produced, were 
used to characterize process performance before downstream analysis.
Twenty-seven samples were processed and sequenced at the Uni-
versity of Ulm, Germany. Exome enrichment was performed through 
biotinylated RNA oligomer libraries, which are part of the SureSelectXT 
Human All Exon V5 capture library. The preparation workflow with the 
SureSelectXT reagent kit included DNA Fragmentation via Covaris 
supersonic shearing, end repair, ligation, library hybridization, index-
ing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based quantifica-
tion and multiplexing (per protocol v.1.7). Multiple quality controls 
via Agilent Bioanalyzer were implemented into the process. Libraries 
were amplified to produce clonal clusters and sequenced using mas-
sively parallel sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencing 
System. Eleven samples were processed (SureSelect QXT Agilent kit) 
and sequenced on a HiSeq 1000 instrument at the University of Nancy, 
France.
A subset of our WES data had reduced coverage in the GC-rich 
region of NOTCH1. For these, targeted deep sequencing of the NOTCH1 
3′-UTR was performed, as previously described6.
WGS
Preparation of libraries for cluster amplification and sequencing 
(PCR-free). Genomic DNA (350 ng in 50 µl of solution) was processed by 
fragmentation through acoustic shearing (Covaris focused ultrasoni-
cator), targeting 385-bp fragments, and additional size selection was 
performed using a SPRI 80 cleanup. Library preparation (HyperPrep 
without amplification module; KAPA Biosystems, no. KK8505) was 
performed as above for WES. Libraries were then quantified using 
quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems) with probes specific to the ends 
of the adapters, normalized to 1.7 nM, and then pooled into 24 plexes.
Preparation of libraries for cluster amplification and sequencing 
(PCR-plus). An aliquot of genomic DNA (100 ng in 50 µl of solution) 
was used as the input into DNA fragmentation. Shearing was performed 
as described above in the PCR-free procedure. Library preparation 
was performed using a commercially available kit provided by KAPA 
Biosystems (KAPA HyperPrep with Library Amplification Primer Mix, 
product KK8504), and with palindromic forked adapters using unique 
eight-base index sequences embedded within the adapter (Roche). The 
libraries were then amplified by 10 cycles of PCR. Following sample 
preparation, libraries were quantified using quantitative PCR (KAPA 
Biosystems) with probes specific to the ends of the adapters. This 
assay was automated using Agilent’s Bravo liquid handling platform. 
Based on qPCR quantification, libraries were normalized to 2.2 nM and 
pooled into 24 plexes.
Cluster amplification and sequencing (NovaSeq 6000). Sample 
pools were combined with NovaSeq Cluster Amp Reagents DPX1, DPX2 
and DPX3 and loaded into single lanes of a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow-cell 
cell using the Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system. Cluster ampli-
fication and sequencing occurred on NovaSeq 6000 Instruments

utilizing sequencing-by-synthesis kits to produce 151-bp paired-end 
reads. Output from Illumina software was processed by the Picard 
data-processing pipeline to yield CRAM or BAM files containing demul-
tiplexed, aggregated aligned reads. All sample information tracking 
was performed by automated LIMS messaging.
Circulating DNA sequencing. Whole blood was collected by rou-
tine phlebotomy. Plasma was separated within 1–4 days of collec-
tion through density centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until DNA 
extraction (QIAsymphony DSP Circulating DNA Kit; QIAGEN), which 
was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Library 
preparation was performed (KAPA HyperPrep Kit with Library Ampli-
fication; KAPA Biosystems) using duplex UMI adapters (IDT), starting 
with 2–3 cc of plasma. Samples were normalized and pooled using 
equivolume pooling, with up to 95 samples per pool. Cluster ampli-
fication was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol 
(Illumina) using Exclusion Amplification cluster chemistry and HiSeqX 
flow cells. Flow cells were sequenced on v.2 Sequencing-by-Synthesis 
chemistry for HiSeqX flow cells. The flow cells were then analyzed using 
RTA v.2.7.3 or later. Each pool of ultralow pass whole-genome libraries 
was run on one lane using paired 151-bp runs.
Sequence data processing and analyses
WES/WGS alignment and quality control. Sequencing was conducted 
using standard methods6,32,42. All DNA sequence data were processed 
through Broad Institute pipelines, such that data from multiple librar-
ies and flow-cell runs were combined into a single BAM file. This file 
contained reads aligned to the human genome hg19 genome assembly 
(v.b37, using BWA-MEM (v.0.7.15-r1140)) provided by the Picard and 
Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) developed at the Broad Institute43, 
a process that involves marking duplicate reads, recalibrating base 
qualities and realigning around indels.
WES analysis. Sequences were analyzed by the Broad Institute’s Cancer 
Genome Analysis WES Characterization Pipeline, in which aligned BAM 
files were inputted into a standard WES somatic variant-calling pipe-
line42 and included MuTect for calling somatic single nucleotide vari-
ants (sSNVs), Strelka2 (ref. 44) for calling small insertions and deletions 
(indels), deTiN for estimating tumor-in-normal (TiN) contamination11, 
ContEst for estimating cross-patient contamination, AllelicCapSeg 
for calling allelic copy-number variants and ABSOLUTE for estimating 
tumor purity, ploidy, CCFs and absolute allelic copy number. Artifac-
tual variants were filtered out using a token panel-of-normals (PoN) 
filter, a blat filter, and an oxoG filter. For tumor samples without a 
matching normal control, a ‘no-normal’ pipeline was used, as previ-
ously described19. Several FFPE samples exhibited lower DNA quality, 
resulting in noisier profiles with standard methods. For these samples, 
we applied an additional filtering technique of identifying the most 
correlated targets across a set of FFPE samples and performing tangent 
normalization45 on samples that showed consistent behavior, thus 
excluding artifactual copy-number targets.
WGS analysis. WGS analysis was performed as previously described46. 
Due to the large amount of computational resources required to pro-
cess cancer whole genomes efficiently, we ran these analysis pipelines 
on an elastic high-performance computing (HPC) cluster on Google 
Cloud VMs, comprising thousands of CPU cores.
For structural variation (SV) identification, our pipeline integrates 
evidence from three SV detection algorithms (Manta47, SvABA48 and 
dRanger49) to generate a list of SV events with high confidence from 
WGS data. Subsequently, we applied BreakPointer50 to pinpoint the 
exact breakpoint at base-level resolution. Breakpoint information 
was aggregated per sample to identify: (1) balanced translocations, 
defined as those with breakpoints on reverse strands within 1 kb of 
each other; (2) inversions supported on both ends; and (3) complex 
events, based on the number of clustered events within 50 kb of each 
other. Breakpoints were annotated by intersection with our lists of 
CLL driver genes and significant sCNA regions, and with genes in the 
COSMIC Cancer Gene Census (v.90)51.
Analysis of UK WGS. BAM files were obtained from prior analysis and 
realigned them to the Broad Institute’s build of hg19 (known as b37: 
https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890711-GRCh
37-hg19-b37-humanG1Kv37-Human-Reference-Discrepancies)46. Out of 
the 17 sample trios obtained from the UK group, 14 samples completed 
WGS (three failed due to data quality and realignment issues). The stand-
ard pipeline as previously described46 was applied to these FFPE samples, 
except for detection of sCNAs. Formalin damage results in extremely 
noisy read coverage profiles, confounding traditional copy-number seg-
mentation pipelines. To mitigate this, we applied a modified sCNA calling 
method that relies on segmentation of allelic imbalance at germline het 
sites (as opposed to segmentation of total coverage) as its primary signal. 
Although total coverage is extremely noisy, the fraction of reads support-
ing alternate versus reference alleles at heterozygous sites is undistorted, 
allowing for clean allelic imbalance segmentation. Within each segment 
of allelic imbalance, we binned total coverage on a megabase scale, which 
is coarse enough to average over formalin-induced coverage fluctuations, 
which typically manifest as sharp coverage spikes at the 10–100-kb scale. 
SV and phylogenetic analysis were completed for 12 of 14 samples.
Identification of regions of kataegis and chromothripsis. In the 
WGS, kataegis regions were defined by genomic regions with at least 
six mutations within two standard deviations of the median chromo-
somal intermutational distance, as previously described52. For FFPE 
samples, to account for increased background sequencing artifacts, we 
considered only mutations with VAF > 0.15. Regions of chromothripsis 
were identified based on integrated evaluation of rainfall plots, allelic 
CN plots and SV calls.
Determining evolutionary relationships between RS and CLL and 
identifying RS-specific genetic alterations. The PhylogicNDT12,32 
suite of tools was used to generate posterior distributions on cluster 
positions and mutation membership to calculate the ensemble of 
possible trees that support the phylogenetic relationship of detected 
cell populations. Through applying this tool across a set of CLL and RS 
samples per patient, the most likely tree was identified using proba-
bilistic modeling and thus parent–child relationships among clones. 
Furthermore, all mutations were assigned to clones based on the match 
of mutational and clone CCF distribution. The RS clone was defined as a 
new emerging clone first detected in the RS sample and absent in a pre-
ceding CLL sample. In rare cases without close antecedent CLL samples, 
RS clones were conservatively identified from distal tree branches and 
through integrating available information on RS purity from pathology 
assessment. If a shared CLL historical clone was identified between 
samples, the RS was determined to be clonally related. If a shared clone 
was not identified across samples, the RS was determined to be clonally 
unrelated. In WGS PhylogicNDT results only, clusters with fewer than 
20 mutations were removed, along with clusters with low CCF (<15%).
Mapping CN alterations to RS and CLL clones. Once clonal struc-
ture was established, subclonal sCNAs were mapped to clones using 
PhylogicNDT CopyNumber2Tree. Posterior probability was calculated 
based on CN profiles and allele-fraction distributions of heterozygous 
SNP sites across samples to assign likelihood of each event to belong 
to a clone with a particular CCF. The RS and CLL specific clonal events 
(both sSNVs and sCNAs) were thus identified.
Discovery of significantly mutated genes in RS and CLL clones. 
MutSig2CV13 was run to identify driver genes from the filtered WES 
Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) file of both the RS history and RS

Article

clones. Divergent CLL clones were thus excluded, allowing for the iden-
tification of recurrent drivers contained within RS cells and clones. To 
improve power to detect known variants further, we ran MutSig2CV on 
a restricted set of hypotheses through utilizing list of CLL6 and de novo 
DLBCL drivers15,19. For the validation cohort, MutSig2CV results were 
reported for new drivers that met significance and were present in at 
least one patient from the discovery cohort.
Identification of recurrent RS focal and arm-level copy-number 
events. Somatic copy-number alterations (sCNAs) were detected 
using the GATK4 CNV pipeline (http://github.com/gatk-workflows/
gatk4-somatic-cnvs), composed of the CalculateTargetCoverage, 
NormalizeSomaticReadCounts and Circular Binary Segmentation 
(CBS) algorithms53 for genome segmentation, with additional nor-
malization for FFPE samples as described for WES analysis. To identify 
significantly amplified or deleted genomic regions in RS samples, 
GISTIC2.0 (ref. 14) was applied, both before and after subtracting 
the CLL sample segment changes, to produce a list of candidate RS 
sCNA driver regions. In parallel, the antecedent CLL sCNA drivers 
were examined through GISTIC. Significant events were reported 
with a Q value threshold of 0.1. A force-calling process was applied to 
identify the presence/absence of each sCNA driver event across tumor 
samples (https://github.com/getzlab/GISTIC2_postprocessing). This 
force-calling process was then applied to all DLBCL recurrent sCNAs 
in RS and to identify RS recurrent sCNAs in DLBCL, both for frequency 
comparisons and to build a consensus matrix for clustering.
Signature analysis. Mutational signatures were determined 
using SignatureAnalyzer (https://github.com/getzlab/getzlab- 
SignatureAnalyzer). We furthermore compared the identified signa-
tures with those in COSMIC (v.3.2)51 based on cosine similarity.
Immunogenetic analysis. To determine the clonal relationships 
between CLL and RS, we inferred the DNA sequences of immunoglobu-
lin genes from WES/WGS data, as previously described6 (Supplemen-
tary Table 4).
Consensus clustering of genetic alterations
Generation of gene sample matrix. All significantly mutated genes 
(MutSig2CV, Q ≤ 0.1, and a frequency of four or more cases) and sig-
nificant regions of sCNAs (GISTIC2.0, Q ≤ 0.1, and a frequency of four 
or more cases) were assembled into a gene-by-sample matrix (Supple-
mentary Table 7c). The entries in the gene-by-sample matrix represent 
mutations and CN events as follows: nonsynonymous mutations, 2; 
synonymous mutations, 1; no mutation, 0; high-grade CN gain (CN ≥ 3.4 
copies), 2; low-grade CN gain (3.4 copies ≥ CN ≥ 2.1 copies), 1; CN neu-
tral, 0; low-grade CN loss (1.1 ≤ CN ≤ 1.9 copies), 1; high-grade CN loss 
(CN ≤ 1.1 copies), 2; WGD, 5.
NMF clustering. The seven samples without genetic drivers in the 
gene-by-sample matrix were assigned to cluster C0. In addition, we 
identified marker genes differentially expressed across clusters by 
applying Fisher’s exact test (2 × 5 table with variant present or absent as 
one dimension and cluster as the second dimension) and corrected the 
P values for multiple hypothesis testing using the BH-FDR procedure 
(Supplementary Table 7f). Features with a Q value ≤ 0.1 were selected as 
cluster features and visualized as a color-coded heatmap. Features were 
annotated with their maximally positive associated cluster, determined 
by computing the 2 × 2 Fisher’s exact test for all five clusters (2 × 2 table 
with variant present or absent as one dimension and within-cluster 
or outside-cluster the second dimension; Supplementary Table 7f). 
To ensure robustness, given the sample size of 97, we performed 100 
subsampling iterations by randomly removing eight patients in each 
iteration and calculated a sample-by-sample similarity matrix that 
reflects the frequency that each of two samples were clustered together 
in the 100 runs. Finally, we performed UPGMA hierarchical clustering 
using 1-similarity as a distance metric. To define the final cluster mem-
bership, we cut the resulting dendrogram based on the modal number 
of clusters across the 100 subsampled consensus NMF clustering runs.
Mutual exclusivity/co-occurrence estimations. For each gene of 
interest, the significance of the co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity for 
each pair of different events (mutations, amplification, and deletion) 
that affects that gene was calculated using Fisher’s exact test, and then 
the false discovery rate was calculated using the Benjamini–Hochberg 
method.
Non-negative matrix factorization consensus clustering. To identify 
clusters of tumors with shared genetic features robustly, we applied 
a non-negative matrix consensus clustering algorithm54 with slight 
modifications. Briefly, we passed the gene-by-sample matrix to the NMF 
consensus clustering algorithm (testing number of clusters k = 2–10) 
and skipped the matrix normalization step so that the distance is 
calculated directly based on the values in the gene-by-sample 
matrix. The consensus NMF method was run as 20 iterations of 
NMF, starting with different random seeds. The NMF consensus 
clustering algorithm provided the cluster membership of each 
sample, the cophenetic coefficient for k = 2 to k = 10 clusters and 
silhouette values for the optimal number of clusters, which was k = 5 
(Supplementary Table 7d).
Bulk RNA sequencing and data analyses
High-quality RNA from CLL–RS pairs was extracted, as previously 
described4. Total RNA was quantified using the Quant-iT RiboGreen 
RNA Assay Kit and normalized to 5 ng μl−1. Following plating, 2 μl of 
ERCC controls (using a 1:1,000 dilution) was spiked into each sample. 
An aliquot of 200 ng for each sample was transferred into library 
preparation, which uses an automated variant of the Illumina TruSeq 
Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit. This method preserves strand 
orientation of the RNA transcript. It uses oligo dT beads to select mRNA 
from the total RNA sample, followed by heat fragmentation and cDNA 
synthesis from the RNA template. The resultant 400 bp cDNA then goes 
through dual-indexed library preparation: ‘A’ base addition, adapter 
ligation using P7 adapters, and PCR enrichment using P5 adapters. 
After enrichment, the libraries were quantified using Quant-iT Pico-
Green (1:200 dilution). After normalizing samples to 5 ng μl−1, the set 
was pooled and quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit 
for Illumina Sequencing Platforms. The entire process was in a 96-well 
format, and all pipetting is done by either Agilent Bravo or Hamilton 
Starlet. Pooled libraries were normalized to 2 nM and denatured using 
0.1 N NaOH before sequencing. Flow-cell cluster amplification and 
sequencing were performed according to the manufacturer’s proto-
cols using either the HiSeq 2000 or HiSeq 2500 instrument. Each run 
generated a 101-bp paired end with an eight-base index barcode read. 
Data were analyzed using the Broad Picard Pipeline, which includes 
de-multiplexing and data aggregation.
Bulk RNA sequencing of validation cohort
RNA was extracted with a Macherey Nagel RNA extraction kit. Total 
RNA-seq libraries were generated from 500 ng of total RNA using 
TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold 
(Illumina), according to the manufacturerʼs instructions. The final 
cDNA libraries were checked for quality and quantified using capillary 
electrophoresis before sequencing with HiSeq 4000 sequencing using 
using 1x50 bases protocol.
RNA-seq data analyses. RNA-seq reads were aligned to the human 
reference genome hg19 using STAR (v.2.4.0.1)55. Lowly expressed genes 
with CPM < 1 in all samples were filtered out. Differentially expressed 
(DE) genes were assessed using limma-voom56 in paired mode using

sample read counts, with |log2FC| > 1and an adjusted P value < 0.25 
as a cutoff. To ensure robustness of the analysis, for the five pairs of 
RS and CLL samples analyzed, DE genes were recalculated iteratively, 
each time leaving out one sample pair. Genes were rank ordered by 
their t statistic multiplied by the frequency they were found significant 
(|log2FC| > 1 and an adjusted P value < 0.1) in the leave-one-out analysis. 
This was used as input for preranked GSEA on HALLMARK pathways 
(1,000 permutations, weighted enrichment statistics, MsigDB v.7.4)57.
RNA clustering of RS samples and integration with genetic 
subtypes
Gene counts were preprocessed with ComBat-seq (v.3.42.0)58 to elimi-
nate possible batch effects, and one sample was removed as an outlier. 
TPMs were computed, and genes were filtered out if TPM = 0 in at 
least one sample, median TPM over samples ≤ 0.5 or median TPM over 
samples > 1,000. TPMs were then log2 transformed, and top genes by 
variance (z score of variance > 1) were z-score transformed for down-
stream analysis. Consensus clustering59 using the hierarchical cluster-
ing (complete linkage) with Spearman distance was used to identify the 
optimal number of clusters (observed as five RNA subtypes), and the 
resulting consensus matrix was transformed into a distance matrix for 
hierarchical clustering (complete linkage). The agreement between 
RNA subtypes and genomically identified clusters was determined 
by Fisher’s exact test. Supervised analysis for differentially expressed 
genes for each genomically identified cluster was performed using 
limma-voom (v.3.50.3)56 as a one-versus-other comparison. Pathway 
analysis of each genomically identified cluster was performed using 
preranked GSEA57 with the MsigDB Hallmark (v.7.4) genesets using the 
LIMMA t statistic to rank order genes.
Single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis
Sample preparation. For suspension samples with admixture of both 
CLL and RS cells, cells were thawed by drop-wise addition of warmed 
media (RPMI 10% FCS) and stained with antibodies (Biolegend CD5 
FITC catalog no. 364022, CD19 PE-Cy7 catalog no. 302216, CD3 PB 
catalog no. 300330 using 2–4 µl of each antibody per 100 µl test) and 
a viability marker (Biolegend 7-AAD catalog no. 420404 at 1:500 or 
Zombie Violet catalog no. 423114 at 1:1,000) before resuspension in 
PBS 0.04% BSA (Ultrapure NEB/Invitrogen). For patients 19 and 41, 
viable CD5+CD19+ cells were sorted into RS and CLL fractions by size 
based on the increased forward scatter (FSC) of RS cells (BD FACS Aria 
II). For patients 4, 10 and 43, viable cells within the lymphocyte gate 
were sorted for analysis.
Sequencing. Five to 10,000 single cells per specimen underwent 
transcriptome sequencing (Chromium Controller; 10X Genomics) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using either the 3′ v2 
kit (patients 19 and 41) or the 5′ v2 kit with BCR and TCR sequencing 
(patients 4, 10 and 43). Each flow-sorted fraction was run as a separate 
lane on the same chip. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on HiSeqX 
or NovoSeqS4 (Illumina).
Data processing of scRNA-seq libraries. Reads were processed and 
aligned to the Hg19 reference genome. All data were filtered using 
Cell Ranger (v.2.1.1 for patient 41; v.2.0.0 for patient 19, and v.3.0.2 for 
patients 4, 10 and 43). Background, or ambient, RNA was removed 
using CellBender, with the exception of patient 41. Data from each 
patient were analyzed using Seurat (v.3.1.4)60. QC filtering was applied 
to remove cells with <500 UMIs, >50,000 UMIs or >10% mitochondrial 
reads. Potential doublets were detected using DoubletFinder (v.2.0.2)61 
using default pN and optimal pK for each sample and removed ahead 
of further analysis. For patient 41, cell-cycle regression was performed 
followed by data integration using standard methods60.
Clustering was then performed to identify B cell clusters; these 
were further sub-clustered for additional analysis of malignant B cells 
using the presence of standard B cell markers (CD19, CD20, IGLL5, 
CD79A and CD79B) and the absence of T/NK/Myeloid markers (CD3, 
CD4, CD8, CD56, CD14, CD16 and CD33). Clustree (v.0.4.2) was used 
to identify stable clusters beforedownstream analysis. UMI/cell and 
genes/cell for each cluster were calculated with Seurat, and the mean 
values across CLL and RS clusters were compared using a Wilcoxon test.
Inferred copy number across single cells (CNVSingle). We applied 
a new tool CNVSingle (https://github.com/broadinstitute/CNVsingle) 
to the above processed Seurat objects. In brief, CNVSingle utilized 
normalization from matched PBMC-derived B cell profiles followed 
by Savitzky–Golay noise reduction. These profiles alongside the per 
cell allele counts across common heterozygous SNP sites identified 
in the samples were utilized by a hidden Markov model running in 
allele-specific mode on subsets of cells. Thus, CNVSingle provides 
allele-specific copy-number profiles for all malignant cell clusters. 
As validation, different types of normal cells provided copy-neutral 
profiles. Single cell–derived allelic CN across clusters was compared 
to WES CN profiles and found to be highly concordant. These profiles 
were then used to identify clusters, as CLL, RS or transitional and cluster 
identities were used for subsequent differential expression testing.
Differential expression testing. Expression analysis was performed 
on CLL and RS clusters identified as those CNVSingle profiles that 
matched the CLL WES or RS WES samples. Clusters that showed inter-
mediate sCNA profiles were considered potential transitional clusters. 
Furthermore, genes with nonzero read counts in fewer than 20 cells 
were removed. Gene counts for a given cluster were obtained by sum-
ming the counts across all the cells in each respective cluster. DE genes 
were assessed using limma-voom (v.3.50.3) in paired mode. The ranked 
gene list sort the t statistic from the DE analysis for RS clusters in each 
scRNA-seq sample was submitted to preranked GSEA to analyze the 
HALLMARK pathways (1,000 permutations, weighted enrichment 
statistics, MsigDB v.7.4)57.
Velocity analysis. RNA inference of directional trajectories was per-
formed with scVelo (v.0.2.4, with fit_connected_states=False) using 
the dynamical model on the normalized data. Spliced and unspliced 
reads were computed via velocity (v.0.17.17)35. The result of the 
model was then used to estimate gene latency, which represents the 
cell’s internal clock and is based only on its transcriptional dynamics. 
The root key parameter has been computed via the CellRank (v.1.5.0) 
library.
Random forest analysis. We used a random forest approach to dif-
ferentiate between CLL and RS cells in the single-cell data. Data were 
preprocessed using the same cell/gene filtering as in the DE analysis. 
To reduce the impact of cell size differences between CLL and RS, we 
performed a z-score normalization per cell. We trained an RF (n_esti-
mators = 1,000, sklearn v.1.0.1) on sample LNs from patients 10 and 
43 and predicted on cells from patients 41 (LN or PB samples) and 18 
(BM) whose cell labels were determined by FACS sorting described 
earlier. We ran the random forest 20 times and obtained a mean ± σ of 
0.92 ± 0.01 when looking at only the LN sample in the test set to avoid 
any potential microenvironment differences. When we included the PB 
sample in the test set, the F1 only slightly decreased to 0.86 ± 0.11, while 
also adding in patient 18 yielded an F1 of 0.66 ± 0.01. The decrease in F1 
score is possibly due to differences in tissues of origin and sequencing 
platforms. The top discriminative features are defined as genes whose 
gini impurity scores were at least 3σ above the mean.
Clinical endpoint analysis and statistical analyses. Data analyses 
were carried out using GraphPad Prism v.9 and R v.4. To compare RS 
drivers identified with previously reported CLL (n = 1,063)6 and DLBCL 
(n = 304)19 and (n = 574)15 datasets, a two-sided exact binomial test was

performed with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing 
correction. To obtain the frequency of RS events in DLBCL cohorts 
before this comparison, we called RS sCNAs in 304 DLBCLs19 and the 
443 primary DLBCLs15 for which purity was >20%. Event frequencies 
were compared when an event was detected in both sample sets. RS 
and CLL drivers co-occurrences were represented by using a Sankey 
diagram. Significance was evaluated by calculating the probability for 
acquiring each of the RS drivers considering the acquisition of a given 
driver in CLL using Fisher’s exact test. To evaluate how often a given 
driver initially occurs during the RS stage in the subset of related RS, we 
performed the McNemar test. Differences were considered significant 
when a P value adjusted for multiplicity of testing was <0.05. Overall 
survival was defined as the interval between date of transformation 
and death or censored at last follow-up. Survival data were calculated 
using the method of Kaplan–Meier, and curves were compared by 
log-rank testing.
cfDNA analysis. After sequencing, plasma cfDNA samples were pro-
cessed and analyzed as reported36. To detect RS-specific changes, we 
undertook the following steps. First, we analyzed delta copy-number 
changes between segments, assigning a positive chromothripsis 
score when three consecutive 1-Mb segments had CN delta ≥ 0.1, sug-
gested locally fractured genome. Second, to assess Richter-specific 
aneuploidy, we evaluated the fraction of genome in non-copy-neutral 
state by FGA, defining a region as altered if the segment had an 
event as detected by iCHOR analysis and a CN change ≥ 0.1 (to filter 
out low confidence CN changes) and comparing to a matched CLL 
sample when available. Third, we assigned WGD to samples where 
copy-number events had allelic ratios (corrected for iCHOR estimated 
purities) corresponding to two levels of allele deletions (that is, 2/0, 
1/1 and 2/1 copy-number states) as measured from the main balanced 
copy-number level (2/2). Lastly, we performed WES on cfDNA, which 
we then examined for RS clonal alterations detected in bulk through 
phylogenetic reconstruction.
