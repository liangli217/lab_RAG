ABSTRACT
Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) at time of autologous stem cell transplant
(ASCT) has been shown to be associated with decreased overall survival
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with multiple myeloma
not receiving immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD). However, the significance
of CH in newly diagnosed patients, including transplant ineligible patients,
and its effect on clonal evolution during multiple myeloma therapy in the
era of novel agents, has not been well studied. Using our new algorithm to
differentiate tumor and germline mutations from CH, we detected CH in
approximately 10% of 986 patients with multiple myeloma from the Clinical
Outcomes in MM to Personal Assessment of Genetic Profile (CoMMpass)
cohort (40/529 transplanted and 59/457 non-transplanted patients). CH
was associated with increased age, risk of recurrent bacterial infections and
cardiovascular disease. CH at time of multiple myeloma diagnosis was not
associated with inferior OS or PFS regardless of undergoing ASCT, and all
patients benefited from IMiD-based therapies, irrespective of the presence
of CH. Serial sampling of 52 patients revealed the emergence of CH over
a median of 3 years of treatment, increasing its prevalence to 25%, mostly
with DNMTA mutations.
Significance: Using our algorithm to differentiate tumor and germline
mutations from CH mutations, we detected CH in approximately 10% of
patients with newly diagnosed myeloma, including both transplant eligible
and ineligible patients. Receiving IMiDs improved outcomes irrespective
of CH status, but the prevalence of CH significantly rose throughout
myeloma-directed therapy.
Introduction
Multiple myeloma is an incurable plasma cell malignancy that evolves from the
precursor disorders monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
and smoldering multiple myeloma (1–3). The standard of care for patients
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma is induction therapy with a three- or
four-drug combination therapy followed by high-dose melphalan and autol-
ogous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and indefinite maintenance therapy, most

commonly with an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD). Older patients or those
with comorbid conditions that make them unfit for ASCT, typically undergo
multi-agent induction followed by maintenance therapy (2). Furthermore, mul-
tiple studies have identified both clinical and genomic factors that contribute
to a faster rate of progression from precursors to overt myeloma (4–9), shorter
progression-free survival (PFS) and decreased overall survival (OS) in patients
with multiple myeloma undergoing treatment (1, 10–12). However, many pa-
tients demonstrate PFS or OS that is significantly shorter than expected from

Clonal Hematopoiesis in Multiple Myeloma
these models, and it is clear that additional factors that influence treatment
response and disease aggressiveness have yet to be described.
Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) refers to the presence of a population of expanded,
somatically mutated, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that can be detected in
the peripheral blood (PB; ref. 13). The mutations in CH are often found in
genes recurrently mutated in hematologic malignancies and are believed to pro-
vide a fitness advantage to the mutant HSCs. The presence of CH is associated
with increased risk of hematologic malignancies (14, 15), namely myelodysplas-
tic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; refs. 16, 17). The risk
of CH is associated with older age, prior smoking, and history of exposure
to radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy (18–21). In addition to hematologic
malignancies, patients with CH are at higher risk of inflammatory conditions
including cardiovascular disease (22), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(23), and gout (24), among other conditions, which are at least in part thought
to be mediated by altered inflammatory signaling in mutant macrophages (22).
We recently reported that approximately 21.6% of patients with multiple
myeloma have coincident CH with mutations at a variant allele fraction (VAF)
of at least 1% at the time of ASCT. In this cohort, the presence of CH was as-
sociated with shorter OS and PFS, particularly in those who did not receive
maintenance therapy with an IMiD (25). These findings suggest a possible inter-
action between multiple myeloma cells and the somatically mutated stem and
myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. While intriguing, this finding
was based on data from a single tertiary cancer center, and only included pa-
tients with multiple myeloma who received ASCT; moreover, all samples were
collected at the time of ASCT, after the initiation of therapy. Serial samples were
not available for analysis to evaluate evolution of CH during multiple myeloma
therapy. To further assess the association between CH and clinical outcomes
in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, we developed a novel
Bayesian method to differentiate CH mutations from germline and somatic tu-
mor mutations and used it to study a large multi-center cohort of 986 newly
diagnosed multiple myeloma cases, including transplant eligible and ineligible
patients. Serial sampling in a subset of patients also allowed us to investigate
the temporal dynamics of CH clones.
Materials and Methods
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation Cohort
The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) cohort is composed of
986 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma whose PB and bone mar-
row (BM) samples were collected starting July 2011 up until the present time.
All patients provided written informed consent to allow the collection and clin-
ical and genetic analysis of PB and BM samples for research purposes. The study
design complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Confer-
ence on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Whole-exome
sequencing (WES) data of PB and BM samples of 986 patients with multi-
ple myeloma (529 transplanted and 457 non-transplanted) were downloaded
from the Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium Clinical Outcomes in MM
to Personal Assessment of Genetic Profile (CoMMpass, NCT0145429) study
(26) in the database of Genotype and Phenotype (# phs000748.v6.p4) and their
PB data were analyzed for mutations in CH-associated genes (Supplementary
Table S1). Clinical data (MMRF IA18 dataset) were downloaded from the
MMRF web portal (https://research.themmrf.org/). Targeted sequencing data
were also acquired on 52 patients, for which sequential PB samples were
available. For targeted sequencing, a bait panel of 568 genes was used, includ-
ing pan-cancer and myeloid-associated genes (Supplementary Table S2). All
MMRF samples underwent next-generation sequencing at the Translational
Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix, AZ.
Detection of Candidate CH Mutations
The first step in the analysis was to detect candidate CH mutations. Se-
quencing data were aligned using BWA-mem and the base qualities of the
aligned data were recalibrated using GATK3 Base Quality Score Recalibra-
tion (BQSR; refs. 27, 28). The WES samples had an average coverage of 113X
across samples (range 14X-257X). Next, we ran a modified version of the
Getz Lab CGA WES Characterization pipeline (https://portal.firecloud.org/
#methods/getzlab/CGA_WES_Characterization_Pipeline_v0.2_Jun2019/5) to
call, filter, and annotate somatic mutations and copy-number variations
(CNV). We modified this pipeline to call blood samples without matched
BM biopsy samples by using a single PB sample (MMRF_1474_1_PB) of the
youngest patient who was a 27-year-old male, that had no CH mutations,
as a pseudogermline control for all PB samples. We used MuTect1 (29) for
single-nucleotide variant (SNV); Strelka (30) and GATK MuTect2 (31) to call
indels; Orientation Bias Filter (32), MAFPonFilter (33), and RealignmentFilter
to filter technical artifacts; ABSOLUTE (34) to estimate clonality; PicardTools
(ref. 31; https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/4.0.
0.0/picard_analysis_CollectMultipleMetrics.php) for quality control metrics;
and Variant Effect Predictor (35) and Oncotator (36) to annotate variants (see
Supplementary Materials and Methods). All variant detection for this cohort
was based on the pipeline described previously (25), which included a prelimi-
nary selection of CH candidate mutations based on AML drivers that served as
a catalogue of potential CH mutations (Supplementary Table S1).
To estimate contamination with DNA from other individuals, we used Verify
BamID (37) using the ExAC (38) VCF to test for germline SNPs with a mini-
mum allele frequency of 25% in the GnomAD population. To control for noise
with indel calling, we used the PB sample MMRF_1474_1_PB of the youngest
patient (27 years old) with no detectable CH mutations to use as an unmatched
control for Strelka and MuTect2. We focused only on variants that were classi-
fied as pathogenic or likely pathogenic CH mutations based on mutation type,
position, and frequency in published reports (14, 19, 39) and public databases
(40). The set of rules to include candidate CH mutations is outlined in Supple-
mentary Table S2. We filtered out variant calls if they had 3 or fewer supporting
reads. Initial selection criteria for qualifying variants included having a VAF
of ≥2% followed by a processing step in which evidence for each candidate
mutation was re-evaluated by MutationValidator (https://portal.firecloud.org/
#methods/broadinstitute_cga/mutation_validator/11) and manual review using
Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV; ref. 41). MutationValidator’s allele counting
identified one candidate CH mutation in TETwith a VAF less than 2%, but we
retained this event in the analysis cohort because it passed the initial selection
criteria. Furthermore, except for DNMTA, TET, ASXL, PPMD, TP, JAK,
SFB, and SRSF, mutations with VAF above 35% were also excluded because
these often represent germline polymorphisms. Then, we removed technical
artifacts (Supplementary Materials and Methods). Note that the BM samples
were first sorted to enrich for myeloma cells prior to WES, thus making our
BM sample purities relatively high (median of 93%, range 1%–100%). Overall,
this analysis yielded 151 candidate CH variants across 129 patients.
Mutation Classiﬁcation to CH, Tumor, or Germline
The next step in the analysis was to test each candidate CH mutation as a
possible germline variant or BM tumor mutation by comparison of the allele

counts observed in the PB sample and the matched BM sample (Supplementary
Fig. S1). We used a Bayesian approach to classify mutations: We combined prior
knowledge about mutation frequencies (expressed as prior probabilities) with
observed allele counts (expressed as likelihood functions) to generate three pos-
terior distribution models for the origins of the variants: (i) a true CH mutation,
(ii) a somatic tumor mutation, and (iii) a germline variant. We note that be-
cause we observe a discrete number of alternate (alt) and reference (ref) reads
for each variant, we do not know the true underlying VAF but rather use a Beta
distribution to represent the likelihood of the VAF (θ), given the allele counts:
P(θ | alt, re f ) = Beta(θ, alt + 1, re f + 1).
The most likely underlying VAF, ˆθ, is the commonly used estimate
alt
alt+re f.
Next, we considered that cross-contamination of the PB and BM samples can
occur (Supplementary Fig. S2). We used deTiN (42) to calculate tumor-in-
normal (TiN) contamination of PB samples. We used ABSOLUTE (34) to
determine (i) the fraction of cancer cells in each BM sample, typically called
purity (α), (ii) the average DNA per tumor cell (in units of haploid genomes)
in each BM sample, typically called ploidy (τ), and (iii) the local absolute copy
number in the tumor cells at the mutated locus.
Under the germline model, we do not always expect a VAF of 0.5 in a BM sample
due to potential CNVs in tumor cells. Because of possible two-way contamina-
tion of PB and BM samples, that is, tumor DNA in the PB sample and blood
(part of the non-tumor DNA) in the BM sample, we express the germline VAF
in each PB sample as:
VAF(PB | germline) = β∗• f + (1 −β∗) • 0.5,
and the germline VAF in each BM sample as:
VAF(BM | germline) = α∗• f + (1 −α∗) • 0.5,
where β∗is the site-specific fraction of tumor DNA in the PB sample (which we
derive from the TiN values; Supplementary Materials and Methods), α∗is the
site-specific fraction of tumor DNA in the BM sample (which we derive from
the tumor purity α, Supplementary Materials and Methods), and f is the site-
specific heterozygous germline allelic copy ratio in the tumor cells. There are
two possible values of f (one for each parental allele) and we choose the value
closest to the observed VAF as the most likely (Supplementary Materials and
Methods).
Under the tumor somatic mutation model, the expected VAF in each PB sample
due to two-way contamination can be expressed as follows:
VAF(PB |tumor) = β∗
α∗VAF(BM |tumor).
Similarly, a BM sample often contains some fraction of DNA from non-cancer
cells, some of which may originate from the CH clone. Therefore, reads sup-
porting a CH mutation may be observed in the BM sequencing data. Because
both the BM and PB samples can have blood and, therefore, the CH clone in
them, under a CH mutation model, we express the expected VAF in the BM
sample as follows:
VAF(BM | CH) =
λ
1 −β∗VAF(PB | CH),
where γ is the fraction of PB DNA in the tumor sample, which represents part
of the non-cancer DNA in the BM sample. Therefore, γ is at most 1 −α∗, if all
the non-cancer contribution to the BM samples comes from PB, and in general,
γ = x(1 −α∗) where x, between 0 and 1, reflects the unknown fraction of
non-cancer DNA that originates from the PB (because we do not know x, we
integrate over its possible values in the model; Supplementary Materials and
Methods).
The likelihoods are described by the following joint models:
Lgermline = Beta(VAF(PB | germline), altPB + 1, re f PB + 1)
× Beta(VAF(BM | germline), altBM + 1, re f BM + 1)
Ltumor = Beta(VAF(PB |tumor), altPB + 1, re f PB + 1)
× Beta(VAF(BM |tumor), altBM + 1, re f BM + 1)
LCH = Beta(VAF(PB | CH), altPB + 1, re f PB + 1)
× Beta(VAF(BM | CH), altBM + 1, re f BM + 1)
where Lgermline, Ltumor, and LCH are joint likelihoods of a variant originat-
ing under the hypotheses of germline, tumor, and CH; and altPB, re f BM,
altBM, and re f BM are the observed alternate and reference allele counts for
PB and BM samples. Note that these models do not assume the clonality of the
CH or tumor mutations.
As a final step in the classification of mutations, we multiply the prior prob-
abilities by the likelihood values to generate posterior probabilities of CH,
tumor, and germline origin for every mutation. For each mutation, the fi-
nal classification corresponds to the hypothesis with the largest posterior
probability.
Next, to study the dynamics of CH mutations over time, we performed the same
analysis on 20 additional candidate CH mutations identified in sequential PB
samples taken from the patients who relapsed while on treatment. This anal-
ysis also enabled us to compare the classification of the mutations at different
timepoints. Reassuringly, all 20 candidate CH mutations were consistently clas-
sified in the first and subsequent timepoints, with 14/20 classified as CH, 3/20
as tumor, and the remaining 3 as germline.
Statistical Analyses
OS was defined as the time from the date of myeloma diagnosis until death from
any cause, with censoring at the date last known to be alive. PFS was measured
from the date of myeloma diagnosis to the date of disease progression or death
from any cause, censoring at the time last known to be alive and progression-
free. Group differences in survival were assessed with log-rank tests, and
median follow-up time was calculated according to the reverse Kaplan–Meier
method. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, with
variance and confidence intervals (CI) estimated using Greenwood formula.
Cox regression was used for time-to-event outcomes; HRs and 95% CI were
reported with Wald P values for covariates. The Benjamini–Hochberg correc-
tion was used to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing. Wilcoxon rank-sum and
Fisher exact tests were used for CH association with continuous and categor-
ical variables, respectively. Ordinal variables with three or more groups were
tested for association with CH using a Kruskal–Wallis test for singly ordered
contingency tables. P values were two sided, and those <0.05 were considered
statistically significant. All data were analyzed using R version 3.5.0 (R Core
Team).
Data Availability

pass trial (NCT01454297) were generated as part of the MMRF Personalized

Results
Baseline Characteristics of the MMRF Cohort
The MMRF cohort consisted of 986 patients with newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma with both BM and PB DNA available for analysis. The median age
was 63 years (range: 27–93), the ratio of females to males was 2:3, and median
follow-up was 4.99 years (range: 0.14–8.07 years; Table 1). Five hundred and
twenty-nine patients underwent ASCT with a median follow-up of 5.5 years
(range: 0.35–7.98), and 457 patients did not receive a transplant with a median
follow-up of 4.96 years (range: 0.14–8.07). Two patients received an allogeneic
stem cell transplant and were thus excluded from the survival analyses. The
median OS of the whole cohort was not reached while the median PFS was
3.1 years. In transplanted patients, the median OS was not reached [95% CI,
not reached (NR)–NR] and the median PFS was 4.2 years (95% CI: 3.9–4.7),
whereas in the non-transplanted patients, the median OS was 4.6 years (95%
CI: 4.1–5.4) and median PFS was 1.9 years (95% CI: 1.7–2.2).
Identiﬁcation of CH in Patients with Newly Diagnosed
Multiple Myeloma
To accurately identify somatic mutations not originating in tumor cells, we de-
veloped a Bayesian method that can probabilistically classify mutations to either
germline, somatic in the cancer cells, or somatic in the CH clone. We started
with the general expectation that (i) germline mutations should have a 50%
allele fraction in both BM and PB samples; (ii) BM tumor mutations should
have a greater allele fraction in the BM than the PB sample; and (iii) CH muta-
tions should have a greater allele fraction in the PB than the BM sample. This
method took into account tumor purity, TiN contamination, and local CNV
to create a likelihood model to accurately distinguish CH mutations from the
other mutation sources. Using this method, we analyzed the identified 145 can-
didate CH mutations and predicted 111 of them as being CH, 17 tumor, and
17 germline ( Fig. 1A and B). Among all 986 patients, 99 patients (∼10%) har-
bored the 111 CH mutations (Supplementary Table S3). In the transplant cohort,
CH was detected in 40/529 (7.56%) patients, compared with 59/457 (12.91%)
in non-transplant patients. Consistent with prior reports, the most commonly
mutated genes were DNMTA, TET, ASXL, PPMD, and TP, together con-
stituting 81% (90/111) of the identified CH mutations (Fig. 2A and B). Most
patients had only a single CH mutation, and 9 patients had two CH mutations
(Fig. 2C).
Given that WES provides lower average coverage (113X) compared with targeted
sequencing (978X in our prior publication; ref. 25), it is likely that a number
of mutations in the 2%–5% VAF range or lower are not reliably detectable in
this cohort, likely explaining the difference in CH frequency between the two
reports. The identified variants had a median VAF of 7% and mean of 10.9%
(Fig. 3A). There were 97 SNVs (87% of all mutations), divided into 47 mis-
sense (median VAF: 7.3%), 29 nonsense (median VAF: 4.7%), and 21 splice-site
(median VAF: 6.5%) mutations (Fig. 3B). The remaining 14 mutations were
frameshift indels (median VAF: 20.2%), including 10 deletions and 4 insertions.
Around 40% of mutations were C>T substitutions consistent with prior obser-
vations that this is the dominant mutagenic signature in HSCs (Fig. 3C). The
overall type and distribution of CH mutations were consistent with previous
reports (25).
Clinical Associations with CH in Newly
Diagnosed Myeloma
The presence of CH was associated with older age, with a median age of
69 years in those with CH compared with 62 years in those without (Wilcoxon
rank-sum test, P < 0.001). As expected, the median age of patients who re-
ceived an ASCT was lower than those who did not (60 vs. 67 years), which
likely explains the slightly higher prevalence of CH (12.91%) detected in the

non-transplanted group. Across the entire cohort, univariate analysis showed
that patients with CH had an increased risk of recurrent bacterial infections
(P = 0.011) and cardiovascular disease (P = 0.0031) but not with cerebrovascular
disease (P = 0.73) or coagulopathies (P = 0.65). Finally, CH present at diagnosis
was not associated with known risk factors for myeloma progression, includ-
ing beta-2 microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), International Staging
System (ISS) score, and high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (Table 1).
Across the full cohort, we did not see a significant association between CH and
OS (median OS of 6 years in those with CH vs. not reached in those without
CH, P = 0.37; Fig. 4A) or PFS (median PFS 3 and 3.1 years for those with and
without CH, respectively, P = 0.29; Fig. 4A). Among the 457 non-transplanted
patients, the presence of CH was not significantly associated with OS (median
OS 5.3 years with CH vs. 4.3 years without CH, P = 0.66; Fig. 4C) or PFS (me-
dian PFS 1.7 years with patients with CH vs. 1.9 years without CH, P = 0.60;
Fig. 4D). Similarly, among the 527 transplanted patients, the median OS was
not reached for patients with and without CH (P = 0.86; Fig. 4E). PFS was also
not significantly different among transplanted patients (median PFS 4.3 years
with CH vs. 4.2 years in those without CH, P = 0.74; Fig. 4F). Furthermore,
stratifying by clone size (i.e., VAF), we still did not observe an impact of clone
size on either OS or PFS. When looking at patients with mutations in the most
common genes DNMTA, TET, and ASXL, we did not find a significant asso-
ciation with PFS or OS, which is likely related to our small numbers and short
follow-up time.
We have previously reported that presence of CH is associated with shorter
PFS and OS after ASCT, but that effect is ameliorated in patients who received
IMiD maintenance (25). Therefore, we examined the interaction between CH
and IMiD exposure in patients with both transplanted and non-transplanted
multiple myeloma. The use of IMiD for induction in non-transplanted pa-
tients or as maintenance post-ASCT was associated with improved PFS
and OS, irrespective of whether CH was present (Supplementary Fig. S3
and S4).
CH and Risk of Secondary Malignancy
Out of 986 patients, 8 patients developed a second primary hematologic ma-
lignancy: 3 AML, 3 MDS, 1 chronic myeloid leukemia, and 1 who initially
developed MDS then developed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Supplementary
Table S4). Furthermore, 25 patients developed a secondary solid malignancy at
some point, including 10 skin cancers, 2 breast cancer, 2 colon cancer, 2 prostate

cancer, 2 lung cancer, and 1 each of hepatocellular, bladder, esophageal, thyroid,
pancreatic, oropharyngeal and granular cell tumor. CH at multiple myeloma di-
agnosis was not associated with increased risk of developing a new hematologic
malignancy (P = 0.57) or a new solid malignancy (P = 0.73). Only one AML
case had a CH mutation at the time of multiple myeloma diagnosis, and the
rest were CH-free. Samples collected at the time of secondary hematologic ma-
lignancy diagnosis were not available for analysis to allow comparison of the
malignant clone with prior CH.
Evolution of CH During Treatment
To evaluate the clonal evolution of CH during the course of multiple myeloma–
directed treatment, we analyzed serial samples in 52 patients (36 transplant and
16 non-transplant patients; Supplementary Table S5). Forty-eight patients had
PB samples collected at two timepoints, and 4 patients had samples at three or
more timepoints. The median time between the first and second sample was
3.12 years (range: 0.97–5.43 years). Among patients with multiple samples, only
3/52 (5.76%) patients had CH at the time of multiple myeloma diagnosis (me-
dian age of the 52 patients was 63 years). Following the initiation of therapy,
CH mutations were present in 10 additional patients (total of 13/52, 25%) with
a median age of 67 years for all 52 patients (Supplementary Table S6). This
prevalence of CH in patients having received anti-multiple myeloma therapy is
significantly higher than the approximately 6%, which is expected in the general
population of the same age group (60–69 years; ref. 16; P = 0.013; Fisher exact
two-sided test). The 13 patients with CH received a variety of intervening ther-
apies: 8 patients underwent transplant, and 12 received IMiD therapy at some
point (Supplementary Fig. S5). The most common emergent mutation was in
DNMTA, found in five of the 10 new CH cases, suggesting that standard mul-
tiple myeloma therapy does not promote CH mutations different from those
seen in the general population. While most patients had expanding or newly
emergent clones, one patient (patient MMRF_1079) had a DNMTA-mutant
clone that shrank while on lenalidomide and carfilzomib, starting at a VAF of
16% and significantly dropping to 5% (P = 0.0017; Fisher exact two-tailed test)
and 4% (P = 0.00025; Fisher exact two-tailed test) at subsequent timepoints
(Supplementary Tables S5 and S6).
Discussion
In this study, we report a novel algorithm for detecting CH mutations using
data from PB and tumor sequencing. By leveraging our algorithm on WES of
PB and BM samples of a large cohort of patients with newly diagnosed multi-
ple myeloma, we were able to remove biological noise due to germline variants
and circulating tumor cells that may contaminate PB samples, which has not
been done in prior CH studies. In this large, multicenter, cohort of patients
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, we detected CH at a prevalence of
10% with a median age of 63 years. The difference in prevalence seen in this
cohort compared with other published datasets can likely be explained by vari-
ations in median age as well as differences in sequencing depth, number of genes
assayed, and mutation detection sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. S6). Overall,
the distribution of CH mutations was similar to that seen in otherwise healthy
individuals of a similar age and distinct from that seen in chemo-exposed pa-
tients (43, 44). We also identified associations between presence of CH and risk
of cardiovascular disease as well as recurrent infections, consistent with prior
reports, suggesting that the presence of CH may be associated with increased
non-multiple myeloma morbidity (22, 45–47).
Our prior work, utilizing a cohort from a single institution, found that having
CH at the time of ASCT was associated with a shorter PFS and OS in patients
with multiple myeloma (25). In this study, we were interested in examining this
association in a larger number of patients from multiple centers, investigating
the effect of CH on the long-term outcomes of patients including those who
did not undergo ASCT, and understanding the temporal changes in CH during
multiple myeloma–directed therapy. There are several important differences
between our prior work and the current study. In our prior study, the follow-up
time was around 10 years, compared with around 5 years in this study, which
may have not provided enough time to see a significant difference in PFS and
OS. Moreover, the prior study only included transplanted patients who received
ASCT between 2003 and 2011 while this study included both transplanted and
non-transplanted patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2011 and be-
yond, which reflects a very different treatment era for myeloma with much bet-
ter outcomes. This includes incorporation of anti-CD38 mAbs in the induction
regimen and maintenance in some cases, as well as consistently incorporating
IMiDs in induction and maintenance, which reliably improve outcomes for ev-
eryone (48–52). In addition, we checked for CH in the previous study from the
stem cell products mobilized right before ASCT, after patients were exposed to
1–3+ lines of therapy, compared with this study which looked for CH in the PB
at time of diagnosis in patients with treatment-naïve multiple myeloma. This
could have led to the higher incidence of CH and even worse outcomes seen
in our prior study. Moreover, we did not have tumor sample available for se-
quencing in the prior study, and thus it is possible that patients with aggressive
multiple myeloma could have had tumor cells present at the time of stem cell
collection with mutations that were erroneously called CH. The presence of
active myeloma and circulating plasma cells at the time of transplant has previ-
ously been associated with inferior OS and PFS (53). There are also differences
in the sequencing platforms used that could explain the divergent results. The
WES used in this study, as compared with targeted sequencing in our prior
work, led to an average coverage that was approximately 10-fold lower and thus
a lower detection rate of CH clones, particularly those with a VAF less than 5%.
Therefore, it is possible that we did not detect an effect on OS or PFS in part due
to lower sequencing coverage leading to some patients being falsely considered
CH-negative when in fact they did harbor smaller CH clones that were below
our detection limit. In further support of this, in our prior report, we were only
able to detect an association between CH and disease progression and survival
when smaller clones (VAF of 1%–2%) were included in the analyses, made pos-
sible through deep targeted sequencing. Of note, the prevalence of CH in our
prior report would decrease from around 22% to 14% if we were to only include
the clones of VAF ≥2%, which is closer to the 10% detected by WES in this study.
Whether these methodologic differences explain the previously observed sur-
vival associations, and the biological explanation for how small clones might
induce outsized clinical effects, will require additional investigation.
Importantly, this study confirms prior findings of a significant clinical benefit
to IMiD therapy (54, 55). This benefit was seen irrespective of CH status, which
is in agreement with our prior report. While emerging data have suggested
that IMiD therapy may promote selection and clonal evolution of secondary
myeloid neoplasms in specific cases, namely in patients with TP-mutant CH
(56), our data would suggest that most patients with CH benefit from IMiD-
based therapy. Thus, the current weight of evidence would suggest that the
presence of any CH should not preclude patients with multiple myeloma from
receiving this beneficial therapy.

Clonal Hematopoiesis in Multiple Myeloma
The dynamic evolution of CH in healthy individuals has been described re-
cently (57, 58) but CH evolution in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing
therapy has not been well studied. Consistent with prior reports that chemo-
exposed patients have higher rates of CH, we saw expansion or emergence of
mutant clones in most patients. However, unlike reports in patients heavily ex-
posed to cytotoxic agents, we did not see a predominance of TPand PPMD
mutations expand, likely reflecting the unique plasma cell–directed mechanism
of action of most agents employed in the treatment of multiple myeloma (18,
44). Multiple myeloma therapy, which primarily included IMiDs, proteasome
inhibitors, and ASCT, led to a significant increase in CH prevalence that was
mainly driven by DNMTA clonal expansion. Prior work has shown that pa-
tients with multiple myeloma who go on to develop secondary leukemias may
already carry stem cell mutations at very low VAF years prior to developing
the secondary malignancy (25, 59). Six of 7 patients with a DNMTA mutation
identified at the second timepoint had undergone ASCT, which is consistent
with reports of ASCT allowing DNMTA clones to grow (60). Whether multi-
ple myeloma therapy led to the development of new mutations or the selection
of preexistent therapy-resistant clones that were below the detection threshold
is unknown. It has also been suggested that DNMTA-mutant clones may have
an engraftment and growth advantage in the immediate post-ASCT setting
(61). The role that clonal evolution of CH during multiple myeloma treatment
plays in the risk of developing secondary leukemias and other clinical outcomes
remains to be elucidated.
In summary, we detected CH in approximately 10% of patients with treatment-
naïve newly diagnosed multiple myeloma using a novel computational
algorithm to confidently assign candidate CH mutations to CH, tumor, or
germline. The presence of CH was not associated with inferior OS or PFS in ei-
ther transplanted or non-transplanted patients, and all patients benefited from
IMiD-based therapies, irrespective of CH status. The negative clinical impact
of CH seems to be mitigated in light of significant advances in myeloma thera-
pies. Yet, throughout the course of treatment, patients with multiple myeloma
acquire and/or evolve previously undetected CH clones, particularly those with
DNMTA mutations, indicating that multiple myeloma treatment may accel-
erate the natural course of CH, the clinical significance of which will require
further work.
