Breast cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignancy in 
women, and approximately 10–15% of cases are associated with hered­
itary syndromes of defective DNA repair1. The most common forms 
of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer are associated with patho­
genic germline variants in two HR repair genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2 
(ref. 2). HR is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that coordinates 
high-fidelity repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs), and func­
tions primarily during the late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle to 
exploit the intact sister chromatid as a template for error-free repair3. 
Although germline alterations that abrogate the tumor-suppressor 
functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 have a role in breast cancer patho­
genesis, comprehensive sequencing studies have demonstrated that 
somatic mutations and epigenetic events in these genes can also drive 
tumorigenesis4–7. Deficiency of HR (HRD) leads to cellular depend­
ence on alternative, error-prone DNA-repair pathways, thus yielding 
characteristic genomic alterations, higher overall mutational rates, and 
unique dependencies that can be used for therapeutic targeting8.
Analyses of tumor-derived genome sequences have shown that the 
loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 yields a distinct pattern of base-substitution 
mutations termed signature 3 (refs. 9,10). This pattern, among oth­
ers, can be discerned via non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), 
a technique used to identify recurring patterns (i.e., signatures) in 
the spectra of mutations from a set of tumors and to estimate the 
contributions of these signatures to the mutational landscape of the 
individual tumors. The etiology of some signatures has been revealed 
through association of their activities with additional data10–13. 
Although recent efforts have shown a significant association between 
the loss of BRCA1/2 and signature 3, several tumors show high levels 
of signature 3 without discernible alterations in HR-pathway genes9,10. 
Furthermore, signature 3 has not been extensively correlated with 
other genetic and epigenetic events in HR genes. A comprehensive 
understanding of the link between the HR pathway and signature 3 
is of clinical relevance given the implications for underlying cancer 
risk and treatment selection.

Biallelic inactivation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 is associated with a pattern of genome-wide mutations known as signature 3. By 
analyzing ~1,000 breast cancer samples, we confirmed this association and established that germline nonsense and frameshift 
variants in PALB2, but not in ATM or CHEK2, can also give rise to the same signature. We were able to accurately classify 
missense BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants known to impair homologous recombination (HR) on the basis of this signature. Finally, we 
show that epigenetic silencing of RAD51C and BRCA1 by promoter methylation is strongly associated with signature 3 and, in our 
data set, was highly enriched in basal-like breast cancers in young individuals of African descent.

Current clinical practice in testing for breast cancer susceptibility 
relies largely on the identification of known pathogenic variants in 
the germline sequence of BRCA1/2 and a limited number of related 
genes14,15. Such germline testing may uncover pathogenic variants 
that are likely to contribute to HRD in the associated breast tumor. As 
the presence of HRD may expose specific therapeutic vulnerabilities, 
we wanted to assess whether the integration of germline and somatic 
data can improve the detection of HRD. Somatic events, such as loss 
of heterozygosity, epigenetic silencing, and other mechanisms that can 
decrease gene expression, can serve as the ‘second hit’ in these genes16. 
Moreover, integration of somatic data can help researchers interpret 
poorly defined germline variants17. Here we hypothesize that signature 
3 could represent a more reliable readout of HR status than germline 
sequencing alone and could lead to improved prediction of breast 
cancer risk. Moreover, signature 3 may aid in the classification of vari­
ants that have yet to be functionally characterized. We therefore sought 
to identify the mechanisms by which signature 3 could arise in the 
absence of pathogenic germline alterations in BRCA1/2. Specifically, 
we analyzed the association between signature 3 and multidimensional 
events (germline variants, somatic mutations, epigenetic silencing, and 
allelic imbalance) in HR-pathway components aside from BRCA1/2.
RESULTS
A distinct mutational signature is associated with biallelic 
inactivation of BRCA1/2 and epigenetic silencing of BRCA1
We first characterized the underlying landscape of genomic lesions that 
operate in breast cancer by carrying out mutational signature analysis 
of 995 invasive breast carcinoma samples from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA)4. We stratified single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) by base 
substitutions in 96 possible trinucleotide contexts (Fig. 1) and applied 
our method SignatureAnalyzer12,13, which uses a Bayesian derivative of 
NMF to infer the number of operating signatures as well as the activity 
of each signature in each tumor (Online Methods).
We identified seven distinct mutational signatures across the 995 
TCGA breast cancers, largely corresponding to previous analyses of 
this series10 (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Online Methods). Of these, 
three signatures arose in a single case each, and we excluded them 
from subsequent analyses (Online Methods). This yielded four recur­
rent signatures across 992 samples: (i) signature 1 (C>T at CpG sites), 
(ii) an APOBEC-related signature (a combination of signature 2 and 
signature 13), (iii) a signature associated with microsatellite instabil­
ity (signature 6), and (iv) a largely uniform signature, similar to the 
previously reported signature 3, that was associated with mutations 
in BRCA1/2 (refs. 9,10,18) (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 2).
Over 10% (100/992) of the samples harbored clinically relevant 
germline or somatic frameshift/nonsense variants in BRCA1/2, well-
characterized pathogenic missense BRCA1/2 germline variants19, 
and/or epigenetic silencing of the BRCA1 promoter16. As previously 
demonstrated, a variety of BRCA1/2 inactivating variants were associ­
ated with signature 3 (refs. 9,10,18) (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 3). 
Fifty samples with somatic or germline nonsense/frameshift variants 
in BRCA1/2 showed an approximately sixfold increase in levels of sig­
nature 3 compared with those in samples without BRCA1/2 alterations 
(P < 0.001, rank sum test; Fig. 3a), consistent with the enrichment of

Figure 1  Characterization of four distinct mutational signatures in breast cancer. (a,b) Each color represents one of the six potential base substitutions, 
with each substitution further stratified by the adjacent 5′ and 3′ flanking nucleotides. (a) We used a Bayesian NMF approach (Online Methods) 
to decompose the overall mutational spectrum across a cohort of 992 breast cancer samples into distinct mutational signatures (SNVs). (b) We 
compared the pattern of each signature with a database of known signatures and their etiologies (signature 3, C>T_CpG, APOBEC, and microsatellite 
instability (MSI)). A signature characterized by C>G transversions and C>T transitions at TC[A/T] motifs (in which the altered cytosine is flanked by 
a 5′ thymine and a 3′ adenine or thymine) is probably attributable to mutagenesis via endogenous APOBEC machinery (APOBEC; COSMIC signatures 
2 and 13). A second signature consisting primarily of C>T transitions at CpG dinucleotides has been described among all tumor types and is thought 
to arise from spontaneous 5-methyl-cytosine deamination (C>T CpG; COSMIC signature 1). The third signature resembles previously characterized 
signatures identified in samples known to have MSI (COSMIC signature 6). A recurrent signature in the series closely approximates signature 3 and is 
characterized by mutations in all 96 nucleotide contexts, with an increased rate among C:G base pairs as compared with that among A:T.

signature 3 reported in a recent data set9 (Fig. 3b). Aside from SNVs, 
epigenetic silencing of BRCA1 (n = 32) and homozygous deletions 
of BRCA1/2 (n = 8) were also associated with signature 3 (Fig. 3a). 
Moreover, 18 samples that harbored the lower-risk truncating BRCA2 
variant p.Lys3326Ter20 (c.9976A>T, chr13:g.32972626A>T (hg19);NM_
000059.3) did not show elevated levels of signature 3 compared with 
those in samples without inactivating BRCA1/2 alterations (median of 
13.4 signature 3 mutations per sample; P = 0.4; data not shown).
A single functional copy of BRCA1/2 is generally sufficient to main­
tain normal HR function, whereas biallelic inactivation of BRCA1/2 
contributes to tumorigenesis via several mechanisms, including 
genomic instability that arises from HRD21. To investigate whether 
monoallelic loss of BRCA1/2 is associated with signature 3 and whether 
HRD (biallelic loss) is necessary for signature 3, we analyzed loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH) at the BRCA1/2 loci (Online Methods), as these 
are the most common second-hit events22,23. We identified 31 samples 
with pathogenic germline variants in BRCA1/2 associated with LOH 
of the wild-type allele (Supplementary Fig. 4). All samples but one 
showed signature 3 activity in the top quartile for the series (Fig. 2, 
Supplementary Fig. 4). Similarly, all 18 samples with LOH that also 
harbored a somatic frameshift/nonsense/splice-site BRCA1/2 variant 
had high signature 3 activity (Supplementary Fig. 4).
In contrast, monoallelic germline inactivation of BRCA1/2 was not 
associated with signature 3 (Supplementary Fig. 4), in agreement 
with recent reports9. Of five samples that harbored pathogenic germ­
line variants without loss of the intact allele, four showed no increase 
in signature 3 activity (P = 0.42). Two samples with a somatic trun­
cating mutation and without evidence of biallelic inactivation also 
showed no signature 3 elevation (Supplementary Fig. 4). RNA-seq 
data for these five cases had very low coverage of BRCA1/2 at the vari­
ant site (≤2 reads) and could not be used to examine expression of the 
mutant alleles compared with that of the wild type alleles. In addition, 
samples with LOH of BRCA1/2 that retained an allele with a benign 
silent germline variant did not show strong enrichment of signature 3 
(Supplementary Fig. 4; median of 12.9 signature-3-associated muta­
tions, in contrast to 71 where LOH retained a truncating event). These 
findings suggest that signature 3 may be a reliable readout of biallelic, 
and not monoallelic, loss of BRCA1/2 and/or of HRD.
Despite the association between BRCA1/2 inactivation (germline, 
somatic, or epigenetic silencing) and signature 3 (88 of 100 BRCA1/2 
events were in the top quartile of signature 3 activity), most samples 
in the top quartile (159 of 247) did not have such events, which sug­
gests that other lesions might contribute to signature 3 activity. Clinical 
assays for the assessment of breast cancer risk include gene panels of 
varying breadth, nearly all of which include a variety of DNA-repair 
genes. As discussed above, numerous germline variants of BRCA1/2 
confer high cancer risk; however, deleterious variants in several other 
genes confer ‘moderate’ risk15 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Therefore, we 
sought to determine whether alterations in the latter group of genes are 
associated with signature 3 (Fig. 3c). In particular, we focused on germ­
line events in which the intact allele was lost (Supplementary Table 1, 
Supplementary Fig. 6). In the following sections, we consider the asso­
ciation between deleterious variants in these genes and signature 3.
Signature 3 is associated with lesions in established breast 
cancer gene PALB2
In search of additional germline variants that could be associated 
with signature 3, we examined all 992 cases for any deleterious

alterations in other known genes of the HR pathway, includ­
ing PALB2, a binding partner and nuclear localizer of BRCA2 
(Supplementary Fig. 6). In recent studies, germline truncating vari­
ants in PALB2 have been associated with a relative risk for breast 
cancer of between 3.4 and 6.6 (refs. 15,24,25). Three samples in our 
cohort harbored germline nonsense/frameshift variants in PALB2, 
and all exhibited elevated signature 3 activity (Fig. 3c). We could 
not validate this association in a recent report of 560 breast cancers9 
because of a lack of these germline events. In agreement with 
our results, however, in a recent pancreatic study26,27, two 
cases with PALB2 germline truncating variants had high levels of 
signature 3.
RAD51C methylation as a key alteration underlying deficient 
HR repair in basal-like breast carcinoma
RAD51 is involved in DNA repair by HR, promoting DNA-strand 
invasion and homology search14. This process requires RAD51 in 
complex with BRCA2 and, to a lesser extent, PALB2 (ref. 28), both 
of which can promote loading of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA. 
There are several RAD51-related genes, including RAD51B, RAD51C, 
RAD51D, DMC1, XRCC2, and XRCC3. RAD51C facilitates the accu­
mulation of RAD51 at sites of DNA damage by complexing with sev­
eral RAD51-like proteins (Fig. 4a).
It is generally thought that germline truncating variants in 
RAD51C do not confer an increased risk of breast cancer29, although

Figure 3  Signature 3 activity in tumors with somatic, germline, and epigenetic alterations in HR-pathway genes. (a) Signature 3 activity is elevated in 
tumors with somatic, germline, and epigenetic alterations in BRCA1/2. The plot shows the number of mutations attributable to signature 3 in tumors 
stratified by germline, somatic, or epigenetic events in BRCA1/2. Pathogenic germline events included those described by ClinVar, in addition to 
frameshift and nonsense variants. We compared the median signature count (med) among each group with that of samples that lacked any discernible 
BRCA1/2 alterations (“no BRCA event”). Two samples harbored a somatic and a germline truncating event in BRCA1/2 and are included in both the 
somatic and germline categories. (b) Signature 3 activity in subjects with germline alterations as previously denoted9. P value comparisons are to 
samples with no germline event. (c) Signature 3 activity is associated with somatic, germline, and epigenetic alterations in HR components beyond 
BRCA1/2. The plot shows signature 3 activity for samples that lacked any of the noted alterations (“no event”) and those with any genetic or epigenetic 
event in the HR pathway. Samples with an event in BRCA1/2 are noted by an asterisk. In all panels, solid circles represent samples with evidence for 
biallelic inactivation, open circles represent samples with monoallelic lesions (i.e., without evidence of biallelic inactivation), open circles with crosses 
represent samples with pathogenic germline mutation and LOH of the gene but no clear determination of which of the two alleles was lost, and diamonds 
indicate samples with epigenetic silencing. Each symbol represents an individual sample. Horizontal lines represent the median. Colors represent the 
type of event: purple, pathogenic germline; pink, somatic truncating; green, epigenetic silencing; blue, homozygous deletion; yellow, all combined

A rt i c l e s
widespread panel-based genetic testing has revealed deleterious RAD51C 
variants among 0.3% of people with triple-negative breast cancer30 and 
in high-risk breast pedigrees31. In our data, one case showed biallelic 
inactivation of RAD51C (a germline variant with LOH that deleted the 
intact allele), and another case presented somatic homozygous deletion. 
Both tumors had high levels of signature 3 (Figs. 2 and 3c), which sug­
gests that inactivation of RAD51C can lead to HRD.
As BRCA1-promoter hypermethylation can promote breast cancer 
development, we investigated whether such events also occur in other 
HR genes. Indeed, RAD51C-promoter methylation correlated with 
downregulated gene expression in our series (Fig. 4b). Of 23 cases of 
RAD51C-promoter methylation, 19 showed at least a twofold decrease 
in mRNA expression compared with the median across all samples 
(Fig. 4b). Seventeen of the 23 samples were in the top quartile of sig­
nature 3 activity, and all but one had no BRCA1/2 events (the one with 
a BRCA1/2 event had elevated RAD51C expression). Thus, 16 cases 
of RAD51C epigenetic silencing explained 10% (16/159) of the top 
quartile without BRCA1/2 events (Fig. 4c). Moreover, the number of 
samples with high signature 3 activity that harbored epigenetic events 
in BRCA1 and RAD51C was comparable to the number of germline 
events in BRCA1/2, which suggests a similar contribution of germline 
and epigenetic events to carcinogenesis (Fig. 4c).
Of note, 52% (12/23) of samples with RAD51C silencing had the 
basal-like expression pattern, and all of these basal-like cases were 
among the 17 RAD51C-silenced samples in the top signature 3 quar­
tile (70%; P = 0.003, Fisher’s exact test). Examination of an inde­
pendent series32,33 with methylation and expression data showed a 
similar correlation between promoter methylation and expression of 
RAD51C (Supplementary Fig. 7). In agreement with these findings, 
cases with RAD51C-promoter methylation and low RAD51C expres­
sion levels showed high enrichment with basal-like tumors (Fig. 4b, 
Supplementary Fig. 7). Basal-like expression is characteristic of 
breast cancers with BRCA1 defects34 and is seen in 81% (17/21) of 
cases with germline BRCA1 deleterious variants and 81% (25/32) of 
cases with BRCA1-promoter hypermethylation35,36; we also observed 
this last association in the independent series (Supplementary Fig. 7). 
In contrast, only 10% (2/20) of tumors with BRCA2 germline del­
eterious variants were basal-like, which suggests that inactivation of 
RAD51C may be biologically closer to BRCA1 defects than to BRCA2 
inactivation. RAD51C-promoter methylation was associated with 
increased levels of signature 3 only in basal-like tumors (Fig. 4d), 
consistent with the strongly reduced expression in this subtype, which 
suggests that RAD51C-promoter methylation is involved in HRD 
mainly in the context of basal-like tumors.
No association of signature 3 with mutations in DNA-damage 
signaling pathway genes
The role of BRCA1/2 in PARP-inhibitor susceptibility is established. 
However, the therapeutic significance of deleterious variants in HR 
components upstream of BRCA1/2 (Supplementary Fig. 5) that are 
also implicated in DNA-damage signaling and DSB detection and 
that increase the risk of breast cancer15 (relative risk, 2–3), such as 
ATM, NBN, and CHEK2, is less clear. In our data set, we identi­
fied 17 germline pathogenic variants in six established or candidate 
breast-cancer-susceptibility genes (7 in ATM; 4 in CHEK2; 3 in NBN; 
and 1 in BARD1, BRIP1, and RAD50; a discussion is provided in 
Supplementary Note 1). Overall, germline pathogenic variants in 
ATM and CHEK2 were not associated with a high level of signature 3 
(Supplementary Table 1, Fig. 3c), and this result was replicated in a 
previously published data set9 (Fig. 3b). The single case with a BARD1 
truncating variant and LOH (loss of the wild-type allele) had a high 
level of signature 3 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 6).
Promoter-methylation events in BRCA1 and RAD51C are 
enriched among young black individuals
We next sought to assess whether self-reported racial differences 
underlie various signature 3 etiologies. The largest racial groups in our 
series consisted of 699 white subjects and 142 black/African American

subjects (the remaining 181 included 57 Asian patients). We evaluated 
differences in the frequencies of genetic (germline and somatic) and 
epigenetic events that contribute to signature 3 between these racial 
groups, focusing on the cases in the top quartile of signature 3 activity 
(159 white and 41 black/African American subjects).
Among the 41 black subjects in the top quartile, 37% (15/41) showed 
promoter methylation in either BRCA1 or RAD51C, 9.8% (4/41) 
harbored germline or somatic deleterious mutations in BRCA1/2, and 
the remaining 22 had no discernible lesion (Fig. 5a). In contrast, 
among the 159 white subjects in the top quartile, 13% (22/159) showed 
an epigenetic event, 32% (56/159) had germline events or somatic 
deleterious events, and the remaining 81 had no event (Fig. 5a; 
Freeman–Halton 3 × 2 exact test; P = 3 × 10−4 for white compared with 
black subjects). Reductions in levels of RAD51C and BRCA1 mRNA 
in cases with promoter methylation were similar among white and 
black individuals, suggesting similar function effects.
Among premenopausal women, African Americans are at higher 
risk of developing basal-like breast cancers than their non-Hispanic 
white counterparts37. Given the association between HRD and 
basal-like biology, as well as the observed differences between 
racial groups in the prevalence of signature-3-associated genetic 
and epigenetic events, we investigated differences between age sub­
groups (Fig. 5b) and within the basal-like subtype (Fig. 5c). The 
most pronounced differences arose among women aged 40–49 years. 
Of black women in this age group, 80% (8/10) showed promoter 
methylation (6 BRCA1 and 2 RAD51C), in contrast to only 18% 
(7/38) of white women. Conversely, genetic events were enriched 
among white women (36%; 14/38), whereas only one black woman in 
this age group had a genetic alteration (1/10). This suggests that the 
mechanism of HRD differs between white people, in whom genetic 
mutations predominate, and black people, in whom promoter 
methylation is more frequent (P = 0.0009). We further examined

whether this difference also arises in basal-like individuals aged 
40–49 and found a similar disparity (Fig. 5c; P = 0.0065).
Signature 3 activity correlates with the pathogenic potential 
of rare germline variants
We next sought to evaluate whether signature 3 can be used to 
characterize rare missense SNVs in BRCA1/2. Understanding the 
pathogenicity of rare germline variants of BRCA1/2 has become 
the focus of several international consortia38,39 and has led to the 
assignment of consensus annotations to rare variants into five 
classes: benign, likely benign, variants of uncertain significance 
(VUSs), likely pathogenic, and pathogenic40. Among the entire series 
of 992 cases, 262 (26.3%) harbored at least one rare (prevalence < 
0.1%) missense SNV in BRCA1/2.
As discussed above, the biallelic inactivation of BRCA1/2, particu­
larly via an inherited pathogenic variant and LOH, is considered a 
hallmark of HRD. As shown above, nearly all samples with patho­
genic BRCA1/2 germline variants and loss of the intact allele had 
high levels of signature 3, whereas those that harbored pathogenic 
variants without LOH had no elevation of signature 3. Conversely, 
samples with LOH that otherwise retained an allele harboring a silent 
germline variant were not associated with a significant increase in 
signature 3 (Supplementary Fig. 4), which suggests that the presence 
of LOH alone is not enough to accurately identify samples with HRD. 
Signature 3 in conjunction with LOH, however, could represent a 
robust readout of HRD and of the pathogenic potential of indetermi­
nate variants. Therefore, we sought to apply a ‘biallelic inactivation’ 
model with high signature 3 levels to potentially discriminate between 
pathogenic and benign variants. We estimated the likely pathogenic­
ity of a variant by using two methodologies based on the biallelic 
inactivation model for HRD (Online Methods).
In the 262 cases discussed above, we observed 143 distinct missense 
germline SNVs in BRCA1/2. Seventy-four were present in more than 
one sample, of which eight also exhibited LOH (loss of the intact 
allele) in at least two tumors (Supplementary Table 2). Of these eight, 
one is considered pathogenic, and seven are thought to be benign19. 
The pathogenic variant, BRCA1 p.Cys61Gly (HGSV nomenclature is 
shown in Supplementary Table 2), was present in four samples, all of 
which exhibited high signature 3 activity along with biallelic inactiva­
tion (three with LOH, and one with an additional somatic truncating 
variant; P = 0.004; Supplementary Table 2). p.Cys61Gly in BRCA1 is 
a founder variant among Poles and disrupts the RING-domain inter­
action between BRCA1 and BARD1 (refs. 41,42). Here we identified 
it via a largely unbiased approach by seeking rare germline missense 
SNVs with concomitant LOH, without familial, pathological, or other 
clinically relevant data. The remaining seven germline variants, pre­
viously described as benign, were not associated with an increase in 
signature 3 activity.
We hypothesized that LOH status in tandem with signature 3 might 
further inform on the clinical implications of poorly characterized 
BRCA1/2 germline variants. To test this approach, we used the set of 
germline missense SNVs in our data for which a functional implica­
tion had been classified by the ENIGMA consortium (n = 142): 5 
as pathogenic variants (class 5 in ClinVar), and the remaining 137

Figure 6  A framework for enhancing the classification of BRCA1/2 germline missense variants using signature 3 (sig3) and biallelic inactivation. 
Beginning with all rare BRCA1/2 missense germline variants (n = 137; 3.5% of randomly selected variants in the TCGA breast cancer data set are 
pathogenic), we dichotomized the group on the basis of the presence of LOH at the BRCA1/2 locus. Those without LOH (n = 82) included only one 
sample with a pathogenic allele (i.e., 1.2% probability of pathogenicity), although this sample also harbored an additional variant with the potential for 
biallelic inactivation. Conversely, among those with LOH (n = 60; 6.6% of variants were pathogenic), samples were further sorted on the basis of allelic 
imbalance (22.2% of variants were pathogenic), elevated signature 3 activity (66.6% probability of pathogenicity), and the absence of lesions among 
other HR-pathway components

as benign (class 1)39 (Fig. 6). Therefore, in our data set the fraction 
of pathogenic missense variants was 3.5% (95% confidence interval 
(CI), (1%, 8%)). However, among samples with germline variants in 
which allelic imbalance favored the alternate allele, 22% harbored 
pathogenic variants (4/18; CI, (6%, 47%); P < 0.001 by hypergeomet­
ric test). Including the even more stringent requirement that a vari­
ant exhibit both allelic imbalance and high signature 3 activity (top 
quartile) yielded a set in which 66% of samples harbored pathogenic 
alleles (4/6; CI, (22%, 99%); P < 4.1 × 10−6; Fig. 6); one of the two 
apparently benign variants also harbored RAD51C hypermethylation, 
which can underlie high signature 3 activity. Thus the combination of 
LOH and signature 3 activity considerably improves the likelihood of 
pathogenicity for a given allele. Conversely, among 16 samples with 
an excess of the alternative allele but low levels of signature 3, all 
BRCA1/2 variants were benign, which suggests that this method is not 
only sensitive but also highly specific. Moreover, in an independent 
data set of whole genomes9, we observed that two pathogenic variants 
(class 5) and one likely pathogenic (class 4) variant (Fig. 3b) had high 
levels of signature 3 concomitant with an LOH event that favored 
retention of the mutant allele9, thereby demonstrating the sensitivity 
of this approach, independent of method or platform.
By considering that either LOH or a second deleterious mutation 
results in biallelic inactivation, we were able to use our approach 
to capture the known pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations among the 
series and accurately classify BRCA1/2 VUSs. Overall, 12 unclassi­
fied missense variants fulfilled the criteria (Supplementary Note 1). 
Downstream, only three potentially pathogenic rare missense muta­
tions had supportive evidence (Supplementary Table 3). Thus, in our 
data set of ~1,000 breast cancers, only eight rare missense SNVs (of 
which five were previously known) were likely to have contributed 
to the development of HR-deficient tumors. We applied a similar 
approach to somatic events, and the results obtained suggested that 
four somatic missense mutations (all in BRCA1) may disrupt critical 
functions in the HR pathway (Supplementary Note 1).
Signature 3 is a robust and independent biomarker of HRD
Finally, because signature 3 could be associated with the degree of HRD, 
we sought to establish a clinically applicable threshold for binary phe­
notypic classification. Such a task is difficult because there is no stand­
ard with which to unequivocally establish whether HRD is present. 
However, germline events in BRCA1/2 and PALB2 are known con­
tributors to HRD. To standardize a measure to estimate the predictive

power of signature 3 for the identification of samples with events in 
HR-pathway genes, we calculated the area under the receiver operat­
ing characteristic curve (AUC), using all cases with deleterious altera­
tions in BRCA1/2, PALB2, and RAD51C as a ground truth positive 
set. The AUC for detecting deleterious alterations was 0.86, and this 
value increased to 0.93 when we considered only germline cases with 
a second hit as the ground truth set (Fig. 7a). A similar AUC for 
the classification of HRD events was recapitulated when we used 
whole genomes or only 8 Mb of sequence and applied a normalized 
version of signature 3. In addition, signature 3 levels were not cor­
related with purity in our TCGA series (Supplementary Note 1, 
Supplementary Figs. 8–11). Thus signature 3 activity may serve as a 
robust classifier of HR events across different platforms.
Assays for HRD are used to identify samples with underlying events 
beyond germline lesions in BRCA1/2, such as somatic events in HR genes 
or epigenetic silencing. The calculated AUC with all events was 0.89 
(Fig. 7a)—slightly higher than that calculated on the basis of BRCA1/2 
germline events, but lower than the estimated AUC for germline events 
with LOH. These results were superior to those obtained with alterna­
tive approaches based on LOH43 and large-scale transition44 scores 
(referred to as HRD–LOH and HRD–LST, respectively) (Fig. 7b), 
largely because signature 3 is more sensitive for the identification 
of BRCA2 and RAD51C events (Supplementary Fig. 12). We found 
that a threshold of 31 signature-3-associated mutations (chosen to 
maximize Youden’s index45) allowed us to detect 82% of the events 
in our data set with HRD, and might be sufficient to identify another 
11% of samples with a yet unknown defect in HR (Supplementary 
Fig. 13). Among samples with more than 31 mutations, we found 
a putatively etiologic lesion in roughly 50%. Most, however, 
also harbored high HRD–LOH and HRD–LST scores (Fig. 7c), 
suggesting elevated degrees of genomic instability. We observed 
that the optimal threshold for the classification of biallelic inacti­
vation of BRCA1/2 events was 37 signature-3-associated mutations 
(Supplementary Fig. 14, Supplementary Note 1). As clinical applica­
tions often assay a subset of genes, we conducted tests to determine 
how many genes would yield an accurate classification of subjects with 
high levels of signature 3 (as defined by exome sequencing) and found 
that the use of 1,600 genes led to an AUC of ~0.82 (Supplementary 
Fig. 15, Supplementary Note 1).
DISCUSSION
Our analysis represents an extended characterization of signature 3 
(refs. 9,10,18) and its relationship to the functional underpinnings 
of the HR repair machinery. Using a multidimensional approach, we 
reliably detected this signature among samples with deleterious germ­
line and somatic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. In agreement with 
published results9, we demonstrated and quantified the association 
of biallelic inactivation of BRCA1/2 with signature 3, and observed a 
lack of association in cases with monoallelic inactivation.
We further used signature 3 to identify a large subset of tumors 
(16%) with no discernible canonical HR defect, yet with a mutational 
landscape similar to that of samples with HRD. When we focused 
on this subset, we found that a small number of them harbored rare 
truncating variants in other components of the HR machinery.
Most important, we demonstrated that epigenetic silencing and 
somatic mutations in RAD51C have similar potential to abrogate HR 
function and yield the same characteristic mutational signature. The 
frequency of RAD51C-promoter methylation events was similar to 
that of BRCA2 germline events and higher than that of somatic trun­
cating BRCA1 events in these tumors. RAD51C silencing events were 
even more frequent in basal-like breast cancers. Although PALB2 is 
currently considered to be an important determinant gene for heredi­
tary breast cancer15, we found only 2 samples that harbored germ­
line PALB2 lesions among the top quartile of signature 3 activity, in 
contrast to 18 with somatically acquired RAD51C dysfunction; the 
magnitude of this finding suggests that RAD51C methylation is an 
important determinant of basal-like breast tumors. Preclinical models 
that lack RAD51C have been reported to exhibit sensitivity to PARP 
inhibitors46, raising potential translational implications for this find­
ing. Therefore, RAD51C methylation could aid in patient stratification 
for agents that target HRD, as is currently being done for ovarian 
cancer patients47.
In contrast to BRCA1/2, RAD51C, and PALB2, protein-truncating 
germline variants in ATM, CHEK2, and NBN that were shown to con­
fer increased risk of developing breast cancer15 (including established 
pathogenic variants; Supplementary Table 1) were not associated 
with signature 3. This finding suggests that these events may drive 
cancer risk via mechanisms independent of the BRCA1/2 DSB-repair 
pathway. Indeed, in two pancreatic cancer studies with 17 combined 
cases of ATM mutations, 16 of which were biallelic, only 1 case showed 
a signature consistent with HRD26,27. In contrast, alterations among 
HR components that are in the same protein complex with BRCA1/2 
(e.g., RAD51C, PALB2, and BARD1) are associated with signature 3, 
accounting for 8% of samples in the top quartile of signature 3 activity 
and 13% of cases without BRCA1/2 events (Fig. 4c). These findings 
may further extend the rational use of novel therapeutics.
“BRCAness” refers to HRD in a tumor that lacks a germline BRCA1 
or BRCA2 deleterious variant16. As we have shown, signature 3 can 
serve as a novel readout of HRD, and thus contribute to BRCAness, 
probably reflecting other defects in the BRCA1/2 part of the pathway. 
It will be important to test the association among different measures 
of BRCAness, including ones based on expression, mutational signa­
tures, and other molecular measures, as well as responses to treatment 
in clinical trials. Our measure of signature 3 could represent a putative 
biomarker for HR status. Current predictors of PARP-inhibitor or cis­
platin sensitivity have had notable clinical success in a limited number 
of patients48–50, which indicates the need for additional biomarkers 
such as HRD48 or signature 3 to identify other individuals who could 
also benefit from these treatments.
The development of a companion diagnostic based on this work 
could inform the appropriate allocation of HRD-based therapies. 
Genomic-based scores, especially when based on clonal mutations, 
reflect the aggregated effect of HRD throughout the development of 
the cancer, but not necessarily its current HRD status51. Although not 
stated by the authors of ref. 51, ovarian cancers with BRCA1 rever­
sion51 are likely to have retained high levels of signature 3 inher­
ited from their ancestor cells, but are unlikely to have ongoing HRD. 
We expect a similar phenomenon with promoter methylation whereby 
platinum (or PARP-inhibition) resistance might arise as a result 
of demethylation of the relevant promoter (for example, BRCA1 
or RAD51C).
Our findings have notable implications for the analysis of germline 
variants. When a pathogenic BRCA1/2 germline variant is found in 
the setting of a breast or ovarian cancer, it is inferred to be the putative 
driver of carcinogenesis52. However, among 28 carriers of pathogenic 
germline BRCA1/2 variants in our series whose tumor LOH status was 
discernible, we identified four tumors that exhibited neither loss of 
the intact BRCA1/2 allele nor elevated signature 3 activity. In these 
cases, either the tumors arose independently of BRCA1/2 inactiva­
tion, or BRCA1/2 haploinsufficiency triggered events that, although 
cancer-initiating, were insufficient to independently generate HRD. 
BRCA1 haploinsufficiency in breast epithelium can lead to defective

repair of stalled replication forks53. Inactivation of BRCA2 among 
other HR factors may cause similar stalling. As these forks can be 
repaired by non-HR-dependent mechanisms54, BRCA1/2 haploinsuf­
ficiency could lead to non-HRD tumor phenotypes. Consequently, 
integration of signature 3 with BRCA1/2 germline testing may affect 
treatment selection.
Moreover, the classification of missense germline variants remains 
a challenging prospect, given the breadth of uncommon variants and 
the large sample size often needed to reliably determine pathogenicity. 
Tumor signatures could be a powerful adjunct to existing methods 
for determining therapeutic approaches55. Importantly, our find­
ings must be interpreted in the context of the TCGA study design. 
Namely, the samples from the TCGA may have limited generaliz­
ability to underrepresented minorities from whom few samples were 
collected. Similarly, accessibility to TCGA-participating centers and 
unblinded enrollment in this study may have introduced unforeseen 
biases into the study cohort. The clinical utility of signature 3 will 
require prospective validation, given the scarcity of pathogenic mis­
sense variants in this cohort (n = 5).
Although clinical genetics has long relied on the use of population-
level data and family-based segregation analysis to identify high-risk 
patients, this approach is of somewhat limited utility among those 
who are part of small pedigrees or who otherwise have limited access 
to familial information, and in the context of the discovery of increas­
ing numbers of very rare, possibly unique, variants. In the near future, 
with the increasing amounts of tumor-sequencing data becoming 
available56, mutation signatures extracted from these clinical sequenc­
ing projects can be used to contribute to variant classification. It is 
possible that some VUSs could have a signature 3 profile that is suf­
ficiently robust to support classification as likely benign (class 2) or 
likely pathogenic (class 4), even in the absence of other contributing 
data. In addition, the contribution of deleterious alterations in other 
genes, such as PALB2 and RAD51C, to HR defects and hence to sig­
nature 3 could lead to the design of therapeutic trials based on the 
findings described herein.

ONLINE METHODS
Data sets. We downloaded a total of 995 unique tumor–normal pairs for 
TCGA breast cancer BAM files from CGHub (https://cghub.ucsc.edu/; avail­
able at NCI’s Genomic Data Commons (https://gdc.cancer.gov/)) on 2 June 
2016 and applied the standard sample quality control and mutation-calling 
pipelines at Broad: MuTect57 for SNVs, and Strelka58 for indels. Application 
of downstream mutation quality control with the oxoG filter59 and the panel 
of normal filtration identified 119,632 SNVs and 12,501 indels.
Mutation signature analysis. Methods and algorithms. The mutational-sig­
nature discovery process involves deconvoluting cancer somatic mutations 
counts, stratified by mutation contexts or biologically meaningful subgroups, 
into a set of characteristic patterns (signatures) and inferring the activity of 
each of the discovered signatures across samples. For this purpose we devel­
oped SignatureAnalyzer, which uses a Bayesian variant of NMF and was 
recently applied to several cancer genome projects (see ref.12 for additional 
background and technical details). The Bayesian NMF method exploits a 
‘shrinkage’, or automatic relevance determination technique, to allow a sparse 
representation for both signatures and activities, as well as an optimal infer­
ence for the number of signatures (K), by iteratively pruning away irrelevant 
components. We used the same parameters described in ref.12. All SNVs were 
classified into 96 possible mutation types (or categories) on the basis of six 
base substitutions (C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and T>G) within the trinu­
cleotide sequence context including the bases immediately 5′ and 3′ to the 
mutated base. We considered only SNVs on autosomal chromosomes (110,704 
SNVs).
A subset of 750 (of the 995) cases was also recently analyzed by Alexandrov 
et al.10, who used a slightly different methodology. In their analysis (which 
also included additional non-TCGA cases), they identified five mutational 
signatures: signature 1B (aging), signatures 2 and 13 (APOBEC), signature 3 
(BRCA), and signature 8 (ref. 10). The results from their analysis are largely 
consistent with ours; however, to take full advantage of our Bayesian frame­
work and to accurately represent the signatures found in our cohort, we 
performed de novo signature discovery and assignment of per-patient sig­
nature activities.
Signatures in 995 TCGA breast carcinoma samples (TCGA995). We first 
carried out a signature analysis for the 995 invasive breast carcinoma sam­
ples from TCGA (TCGA995)4, and identified seven mutational signatures 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Among them, four signatures were recurrently active 
across samples: S995A (cosine similarity 0.96 to COSMIC1), S995B (cosine 
similarity 0.89 to COSMIC3), S995C (a combined APOBEC signature of 
COSMIC2 and COSMIC13), and S995D (cosine similarity 0.83 to COSMIC6). 
A majority of SNVs (88%) were attributed to these four signatures—S995A 
(18%), S995B (26%), S995C (33%), and S995D (11%). The activities of the 
three remaining signatures—S995E (cosine similarity 0.96 to COSMIC10), 
S995F (cosine similarity 0.9 to COSMIC24), and S995G (no match to 30 
COSMIC signatures with cosine similarity > 0.83)—were predominant each 
in a singular case: an ultra-mutant tumor (>5,800 SNVs) harbored a POLE 
exonuclease domain mutation (P286R) and contained about 70% of SNVs 
associated with S995E; 48% of SNVs associated with S995F were attributed to 
a single sample (and only 2% to the next highest active sample); and 88% of 
SNVs associated with S995G were attributed to a single sample (and only 4% 
to the next highest active sample).
Signatures in 992 TCGA breast carcinoma samples (TCGA992). We excluded 
three samples with significant enrichment of singleton signatures (S995E, 
S995F, and S995G) and carried out the signature analysis again across the 992 
samples (TCGA992). Out of 50 independent Bayes NMF runs, nearly 80% of 
the runs converged to the four-signature solution (TCGA992-S4; Fig. 1), and 
20% converged to the five-signature solution (TCGA992-S5; Supplementary 
Fig. 16). Although signatures in both solutions looked similar, there were 
some notable differences: (i) both C>T APOBEC and C>G APOBEC signa­
tures in TCGA992-S5 merged to form a single combined APOBEC signature 
in TCGA992-S4 (APOBEC in Fig. 1), and (ii) the concordance of putative 
BRCA and MSI signatures to corresponding COSMIC signatures was much 
higher in the four-signature solution with cosine similarities of 0.95 versus 
0.82 to COMSIC3 and 0.95 versus 0.82 to COMSIC3, in TCGA992-S4 and 
TCGA992-S5, respectively. For downstream analyses throughout, we used 
the signature set in TCGA992-S4, which was the most probable (i.e., had a 
higher posterior probability) and had a much higher concordance to COSMIC 
signatures.
Germline variant calling, sample QC, and site QC. The variants in the 992 
germline exomes of the TCGA breast cancer study were jointly called with 
about 36,600 additional germline exomes (a total of 37,607 germline exomes,) 
including TCGA samples, non-TCGA cancer samples, and general popula­
tion controls. The variants were called using best practices with the Genome 
Analysis Toolkit HaplotypeCaller (version 3.1)60.
Germline variants among 20 DNA-repair genes commonly used in clini­
cal gene panel tests (BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, PALB2, ATM, ATR, BARD1, 
BRIP1, MRE11, NBN, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51D, TP53, XRCC2, FANCA, 
FANCD2, FANCM, CHEK1, and CHEK2) were extracted from the call set, 
and common variants (with a minor allele frequency > 1% in the non-cancer 
ExAC61 normal population cohort (ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/ExAC_
release/release0.3.1/subsets/)) were removed. All genotype calls with a geno­
type quality score less than 20 (the Phred-scaled confidence in the genotype 
call) were removed, along with sites that violated Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium 
(P < 0.001) and sites with a quality-by-depth score of <5.
Clinical annotation of BRCA1/2 germline variants. BRCA1/2 germline 
events were considered to be pathogenic if they resulted in a premature stop 
codon (i.e., nonsense mutation) or a frameshift (excluding BRCA2 p.Lys3326*, 
which is known to be a low-penetrance allele and is therefore a special case). 
The majority of these mutations are represented in ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/). In addition, missense mutations that were annotated 
as pathogenic in ClinVar were also considered pathogenic in our analysis. We 
treated splice-site variants similarly to missense mutations. However, no path­
ogenic splice-site variants were found in BRCA1/2 in this cohort. In addition, 
for each of the heterozygous germline variants, we also annotated their allelic 
imbalance in the corresponding tumor. We assessed the allelic imbalance by 
tallying reads that supported the reference and the nonreference alleles at the 
germline site in the corresponding tumor whole-exome sequencing data (BAM 
file). To determine whether the alternate (ALT) allele was lost in cases of LOH, 
we carried out a one-sided Fisher’s exact test of the reads that supported the 
ALT/reference (REF) allele in the tumor versus the patient-matched normal 
tissue to establish whether the bias toward the ALT increased in the tumor. 
Cases in which the test yielded P < 0.05 were considered ‘ALT retained’. For P 
> 0.05, we defined the LOH status as undetermined.
A file with a table of germline variants, their annotations, and their associ­
ated samples is available in a TCGA patient-protected manner in FireCloud 
(available from the corresponding author upon request).
Loss-of-heterozygosity analysis. To determine the local copy numbers of 
BRCA1 and BRCA2, we ran the ABSOLUTE algorithm62 on all TCGA breast 
cancer tumor samples, which yielded an allele-specific absolute copy number 
profile for the entire genome. The ABSOLUTE algorithm was run on both 
exome-based and SNP-array-based copy-ratio segmentation, and the higher-
quality result of the two was used in the final copy-number analysis. Absolute 
copy numbers at the BRCA1/2 loci were estimated from the genome-wide 
profile. A gene was labeled as having LOH when one allele was clonally deleted 
(i.e., had an allelic absolute copy number of 0) and the other allele was not 
clonally deleted (i.e., had an absolute copy number > 0). Homozygous deletions 
occurred when the allelic copy number was 0 for both alleles. This analysis 
was also conducted with FireCloud (http://www.firecloud.org), a cloud-based 
genome-analysis platform developed at the Broad Institute.
Epigenetic silencing. DNA methylation of all gene promoters was assessed 
at probes within a window that spanned 1,500 bp upstream and downstream 
of transcription start sites, using both HM27 and HM450 data in 975 of the 
992 samples. To evaluate whether methylation of a promoter was associated 
with transcriptional downregulation (i.e., epigenetic silencing), we cor­
related promoter-methylation levels with mRNA levels. Among HR genes, 
the promoter-methylation levels of BRCA1 and RAD51C were significantly

anticorrelated with the gene mRNA levels (P < 0.001; Wilcoxon rank-sum test) 
and, therefore, were identified as ‘epigenetically silenced’. We further evaluated 
epigenetic silencing on a per-sample basis, using promoter-methylation levels 
independent of concomitant gene expression levels.
