 ABSTRACT 
 Brain metastases are associated with a dismal prognosis. Whether brain metas-
tases harbor distinct genetic alterations beyond those observed in primary tumors 
is unknown. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 86 matched brain metastases, primary tumors, 
and normal tissue. In all clonally related cancer samples, we observed branched evolution, where all 
metastatic and primary sites shared a common ancestor yet continued to evolve independently. In 
53% of cases, we found potentially clinically informative alterations in the brain metastases not 
detected in the matched primary-tumor sample. In contrast, spatially and temporally separated brain 
metastasis sites were genetically homogenous. Distal extracranial and regional lymph node metas-
tases were highly divergent from brain metastases. We detected alterations associated with sensitiv-
ity to PI3K/AKT/mTOR, CDK, and HER2/EGFR inhibitors in the brain metastases. Genomic analysis 
of brain metastases provides an opportunity to identify potentially clinically informative alterations 
not detected in clinically sampled primary tumors, regional lymph nodes, or extracranial metastases. 
 SIGNIFICANCE: Decisions for individualized therapies in patients with brain metastasis are often made 
from primary-tumor biopsies. We demonstrate that clinically actionable alterations present in brain 
metastases are frequently not detected in primary biopsies, suggesting that sequencing of primary 
biopsies alone may miss a substantial number of opportunities for targeted therapy.  Cancer Discov;

Genomics of Brain Metastases
RESEARCH BRIEF
and (iii) determine whether lymph nodes or extracranial 
metastases are genetically similar to brain metastases and 
might serve as their proxy for genomic assessment and clinical 
decision making. 
 RESULTS 
 Patients 
 Clinical characteristics of the 86-patient case series are 
shown in Supplementary Table S1. The majority of the cases 
were derived from lung ( n = 38), breast ( n = 21), and renal cell 
carcinomas ( n = 10). Of the 86 patients, 48 had a single brain 
metastasis, whereas the rest of the cases had additional brain 
metastases diagnosed radiographically. 
 Genetic Divergence of Brain Metastases and 
Primary Tumors 
 Several lines of evidence indicate that tumors exhibit 
genetic heterogeneity both across different anatomic regions 
( 3–6 ,  8 ,  15 ) and within single cancer-tissue samples ( 7 ,  9 ,  16, 
17 ). We applied previously described computational methods 
to address the heterogeneity of cancer-tissue samples and 
inferred the evolutionary relationship between the sequenced 
tissue samples from each patient ( 16 ,  18–20 ). We integrated 
data from somatic point mutations and copy-number altera-
tions to estimate the fraction of cancer cells harboring each 
point mutation; that is, their cancer-cell fraction (CCF; refs. 
 16 ,  18–21 ). Analysis of the CCF for each mutation across the 
tissue samples derived from the same patient allowed us to 
infer phylogenetic trees relating all cancer subclones detected 
(Supplementary Figs. S1–S6). 
 Corroborating prior observations, all clonally related pri-
mary tumor and brain metastasis samples were consistent 
with a branched evolution pattern ( 4 ,  22 ). Although they 
shared a common ancestor, both the primary tumor and the 
metastasis continued to evolve separately, reﬂ ected by (i) the 
presence of distinct mutations (“private mutations”) with a 
CCF = 1 (i.e., present in all cancer cells) in both samples (Sup-
plementary Figs. S1 and S 7 ); and (ii) the fact that each sample 
continued to develop minor cancer-cell populations deﬁ ned 
by mutations with CCF < 1. 
 We failed to identify a minor cancer-cell population in any 
primary-tumor sample that was the ancestor of its paired 
metastasis. Such a metastasis-founding subclone would harbor 
mutations in a subset of the cancer cells of the primary-
tumor sample (CCF primary < 1) that were present in all cancer 
cells (CCF met = 1) of the metastasis sample (Supplementary 
Fig. S7B). Although it is possible that more comprehensive 
sampling of primary-tumor tissue might have revealed such 
founding ancestor subclones ( 20 ,  22 ), this would not have 
been clinically feasible in most cases. 
 In four of 86 primary/metastasis pairs analyzed, we 
did not identify common mutations between the primary 
tumor and metastasis samples, suggesting that they were 
clonally unrelated (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Three of 
these arose in the lungs of smokers, with multiple histo-
logically distinct primary tumors diagnosed clinically. An 
additional patient with breast cancer had another primary 
tumor in the contralateral breast; this patient was found to 
harbor a heterozygous germline  BRCA1 (5385insC) allele. 
 INTRODUCTION 
 Brain metastases, most frequently originating from 
melanoma and carcinomas of the lung and breast, are the 
most common tumor in the brain. Approximately 200,000 
cases are diagnosed annually in the United States alone. 
Patients frequently develop brain metastases even while their 
extracranial disease remains under control ( 1 ). Median sur-
vival ranges from 3 to 27 months following metastatic spread 
to the brain ( 1 ). Of patients who have clinically symptomatic 
brain metastases, approximately half succumb to the can-
cer in their brain ( 2 ). Unfortunately, treatment options are 
limited, and most current clinical trials in the United States 
exclude patients with brain metastases. 
 Because cancers are genetically heterogeneous ( 3–9 ), sam-
pling a cancer in two different locations is expected to reveal 
mutations exclusive to each sample. Furthermore, because 
brain metastases are often resected during clinical care, 
such tissue provides an immediate opportunity for genomic 
assessment of these life-threatening lesions. To date, the 
extent to which brain metastases, often manifesting years 
after the primary malignancy, share the genetic proﬁ le of 
the primary tumor remains unknown. Massively parallel 
sequencing of brain metastases has been performed on a 
limited number of cases ( 7 ,  10 ), showing novel alterations in 
the metastatic site. Prior studies have suggested activation 
of the PI3K pathway in brain metastases ( 11, 12 ). Some gene 
expression signatures have been associated with metastasis 
to the brain ( 13, 14 ). 
 We performed whole-exome sequencing on 86 “trios” of 
patient-matched brain metastases, primary tumors, and nor-
mal samples, all of which were collected in the course of clini-
cal care (e.g., for diagnosis, symptom control, or restaging). 
For 15 patients, we also characterized multiple metastatic 
brain lesions, distal extracranial metastases, and additional 
samples from the primary tumor or associated regional lymph 
nodes. Our objectives were to (i) determine whether clinically 
sampled brain metastases harbor distinct potentially clinically 
informative mutations not detected in paired primary-tumor 
samples; (ii) determine the extent to which such mutations are 
shared among multiple regions of a single brain metastasis, 
anatomically distinct brain metastasis sites, and temporally 
separated lesions (in cases that recurred following therapy);

RESEARCH BRIEF
These 4 patients likely developed multiple clonally inde-
pendent cancers in the context of exposure to tobacco 
carcinogens or germline risk, suggesting that their brain 
metastases arose from separate primary tumors (unavail-
able for analysis). 
 In many cases, we identiﬁ ed potentially clinically relevant 
mutations in the brain metastasis that were not detected in 
the clinically sampled primary tumor. Because the primary 
and metastatic tissue samples were fully diverged siblings 
with no detectable overlap of subclones, we calculated 
power to have observed these mutations in the primary-
tumor samples assuming a CCF of 1.0. However, it could 
be argued that small subclones representing ancestors of 
the metastasis might have been present in the primary 
samples, but not detected (because their CCF would not 
signiﬁ cantly displace that of their sibling subclones with 
apparent CCF = 1.0 in the primary sample). We therefore 
also calculated the minimum CCF of these mutations in 
the primary sample for which we had detection power 
≥ 0.95 (minimum CCF 95 ). 
 For example, in a patient who had undergone resection of 
a primary renal cell carcinoma (case 218), but subsequently 
developed both extracranial metastases 3 years after resec-
tion and a brain metastasis 7 months later while on beva-
cizumab for progressive extracranial disease, we detected a 
homozygous  PTEN nonsense mutation in the brain metas-
tasis, but not in the primary-tumor sample. Biallelic loss 
of  PTEN may correlate with sensitivity to some PI3K/AKT/
mTOR inhibitors ( 23 ), and has also been found to medi-
ate resistance to other inhibitors, including EGFR ( 24 ) and 
PI3K inhibitors ( 25 ). Deep sequencing of the primary-tumor 
sample using an independent library further supported the 
absence of the mutation (0 of 263 reads; power > 0.99; mini-
mum CCF 95 = 0.032). As previously reported in non–central 
nervous system metastases of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma 
(ccRCC; ref.  4 ), we also observed convergent evolution in this 
case, with distinct  PBRM1 frameshift mutations present in 
the brain metastasis and primary tumor, conﬁ rmed with deep 
sequencing of the primary tumor ( Fig. 1A and Supplemen-
tary Table S2). 
 A second patient ( 24 ) with a single synchronous brain 
metastasis from ccRCC had mutations in  MTOR ,  VHL , 
and  PBRM1 that were shared by the metastasis and pri-
mary tumor. Additional alterations in  PIK3CA (p.E542K) and 
 CDKN2A (homozygous deletion) were detected only in the 
brain-metastasis sample ( Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S8). 
Deep sequencing with an independent library failed to detect 
 PIK3CA (Supplementary Table S2) in the primary-tumor sam-
ple (0 of 733 reads, power > 0.99; minimum CCF 95 = 0.014). 
 A third patient (135) with HER2-ampliﬁ ed breast cancer 
and stable extracranial disease developed a brain metastasis 
after 3 years of trastuzumab therapy. The brain metasta-
sis and primary tumor shared an ampliﬁ cation in  ERBB2 
and a homozygous deletion of  TP53 ; however, the primary 
tumor harbored an additional  MYC ampliﬁ cation that was 
not observed in the brain-metastasis sample, and the brain 
metastasis harbored a homozygous missense mutation of 
uncertain signiﬁ cance in  BRCA2 (p.H2563N) that was not 
detected in the primary-tumor sample (0/82 reads;  Fig. 1C ). 
Deep sequencing of an independent library from the primary-
tumor sample (0/133 reads; power > 0.99; minimum CCF 95 = 
0.027) also failed to detect the  BRCA2 mutation (Supplemen-
tary Table S2). 
 A fourth patient (0244) with HER2-ampliﬁ ed breast can-
cer developed a brain metastasis after 2 years of trastuzu-
mab therapy. We detected both a broad ampliﬁ cation (six 
copies) and an activating point mutation in  EGFR (L858R; 
7/129 reads) in the metastasis sample. In this case, the 
mutant L858R allele was not ampliﬁ ed, consistent with the 
ampliﬁ cation having occurred prior to the mutation ( Fig. 
1D ). Both the ampliﬁ cation and the mutation were not 
observed in the primary-tumor sample (0/204 reads;  Fig. 
1D ) validated with additional deep sequencing (0/419 reads; 
power > 0.99, minimum CCF = 0.067; Supplementary Table 
S2). Although the L858R mutation is common in lung can-
cers and is associated with sensitivity to geﬁ tinib ( 26 ), one 
proposed mechanism of resistance in anti-HER2 therapy 
in breast cancer is activation of EGFR ( 27, 28 ), suggesting 
that trastuzumab therapy may have selected for this mutant 
allele. We also detected an  FGFR1 ampliﬁ cation in the brain 
metastasis and a  CCND2 ampliﬁ cation in the primary tumor 
( Fig. 1D ). 
 A ﬁ fth patient (331) with serous ovarian cancer experienced 
a complete remission for 1 year following chemotherapy and 
subsequently developed a solitary brain metastasis 5 years 
later. The brain metastasis harbored a high-level ampliﬁ cation 
of  ERBB2 (32 copies). Using immunohistochemical staining, 
we conﬁ rmed that HER2 was indeed overexpressed in the 
metastasis and was not detected in the primary tumor sample 
( Fig. 1E ). Although  HER2 ampliﬁ cations are not commonly 
observed in serous ovarian cancer ( 29 ), such ampliﬁ cation 
events have been shown to confer sensitivity to anti-HER2 
therapy in breast and other cancers ( 30 ). We also identiﬁ ed a 
 BRAF ampliﬁ cation in the primary tumor that was not present 
in the brain-metastasis sample ( Fig. 1E ). Further ampliﬁ ca-
tions of  FGFR1 and  MYC were detected only in the brain 
metastasis (6 and 7 copies, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 
S9). These ﬁ ve examples demonstrate that genomic sampling 
of resected brain metastases revealed potentially actionable 
mutations not detected in the clinically sampled primary 
tumors. 
 The Landscape of Clinically Informative Driver 
Alterations in Clinically Sampled Brain Metastases 
and Primary Tumors 
 The genetic divergence observed between clinically sam-
pled primary tumors and brain metastases implies that 
potentially clinically actionable targets present in the 
brain metastasis may not be detected from analysis of 
a single sample of the primary tumor ( Fig. 1 and Sup-
plementary Fig. S1). We therefore evaluated the extent to 
which primary-tumor biopsies and resected brain metas-
tases, collected as part of clinical care, would allow iden-
tiﬁ cation of oncogenic alterations with potential clinical 
signiﬁ cance across our entire series of 86 paired cases. To 
systematically perform this evaluation, we used the TAR-
GET database ( 31 ) of genes for which somatic alterations 
have therapeutic or prognostic implications (Supplemen-
tary Table S3). Many of the TARGET alterations serve as 
eligibility criteria in the context of genomically guided

clinical trials in cancer, both histology speciﬁ c or independ-
ent of histology ( 31 ). Alterations in TARGET genes were 
prioritized according to deﬁ ned criteria ( 31 ). For exam-
ple, some genes were required to have biallelic inactiva-
tion, whereas others required ampliﬁ cation or speciﬁ c point 
mutations. To organize our analysis, we partitioned the 
TARGET genes into 13 categories (Supplementary Table S3) 
corresponding to alterations that may be associated with 
response to speciﬁ c classes of targeted therapies, or which 
consist of important cancer drivers associated with progno-
sis ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S10). 
 A total of 95,431 gene alterations were detected across our 
dataset, of which 330 met the TARGET criteria of being clini-
cally informative. Forty-six of 86 (53%) cases harbored at least 
one such potentially actionable alteration in the brain metas-
tasis that was not identiﬁ ed in the paired primary-tumor 
sample. For all mutations detected exclusively in either the 
primary tumor or metastasis sample of a given patient, we 
conﬁ rmed that sequencing depth covering the absent muta-

tion provided adequate detection power (>0.99; Supplemen-

 Alterations potentially predicting sensitivity to cyclin-
dependent kinase (CDK ) inhibitors ( 31–33 ) were common 
across our case series, with 71 alterations in 48 cases occur-
ring in 10 of 11 evaluated genes ( Fig. 2A ). Of the 71 altera-
tions, 44 were shared, seven were only in the primary sample, 
and 20 were only in the brain-metastasis sample. The most 
frequently altered gene in this group was  CDKN2A , with 17 
events in total, including homozygous deletions in three of 
eight ccRCC cases that were only in the brain-metastasis sam-
ples ( Fig. 2A ).  MCL1 ampliﬁ cations, which preclinical studies 
have shown to be associated with sensitivity to CDK inhibi-
tors ( 34 ), were also common; ﬁ ve out of the 15 events were 
detected only in the brain-metastasis samples. In addition, 
ﬁ ve cases had shared homozygous  RB1 loss, which is associ-
ated with resistance to CDK inhibitors ( 35 ). 
 Mutations affecting the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway were 
also frequent, with 43 alterations in 37 cases occurring in

10 of 15 evaluated genes ( Fig. 2B ). Of the 43 alterations, 
24 were shared, ﬁ ve were detected only in the primary 
samples, and 14 were detected only in the brain-metastasis 
samples. Actionable alterations in these genes occurred fre-
quently in breast cancers (9/21 cases, 6/9 of which were 
shared), and lung adenocarcinoma (12/29 cases, 8/12 of 
which were shared). Four of the eight brain metastases from 
patients with primary ccRCC harbored mutations in the 
PI3K–mTOR pathway detected only in the brain-metastasis 
samples. In addition to the  PTEN mutation described above 
( Fig. 1A ), another case had a shared small in-frame deletion 
(p.D52del) in  PTEN with an additional splice site mutation 
detected only in the brain-metastasis sample. A third ccRCC 
case harbored a  PIK3CA E542K mutation ( Fig. 1B and  Fig. 
2B ), and a fourth harbored a  PIK3R1 N564D mutation 
previously reported in glioblastoma ( 36 ) that activates the 
PI3K–AKT pathway ( 37 ). A ﬁ fth ccRCC brain metastasis 
harbored a small frameshift deletion in  PTEN (K6fs) that 
was predicted to be heterozygous (not shown). Activation of 
the PI3K–mTOR pathway has been reported in metastatic 
ccRCC lesions in extracranial sites ( 4 ). 
 We also found mutations that predict sensitivity to HER2/
EGFR inhibitors (e.g., trastuzumab, geﬁ tinib, cetuximab, 
erlotinib, lapatinib) in 26 cases in two of four evaluated 
genes (32 alterations, 20 shared, 2 only in primary-tumor 
samples, 10 only in brain-metastasis samples). Thirteen 
of 21 breast cancers harbored ampliﬁ cations in  ERBB2 , all 
of which were shared. In one case (076), we detected an 
additional activating  ERBB2 missense mutation (V777L; 
ref.  38 ) only in the brain-metastasis sample in addition to 
the shared  ERBB2 ampliﬁ cation. Notably, 2 patients with 
lung cancer ( Fig. 2C ) and a third with ovarian cancer ( Fig. 
1E ) had  ERBB2 ampliﬁ cations detected only in the brain-
metastasis samples. Two patients with HER2-ampliﬁ ed 
breast cancer harbored  EGFR alterations detected only in 
the brain-metastasis samples; in addition to the case above 
( Fig. 1E ), a second patient harbored broad ampliﬁ cation of 
 EGFR (seven copies;  Fig. 2C ). 
 The MAPK pathway inhibitor family includes agents that 
inhibit  BRAF and  MEK , such as vemurafenib, dabrafenib, 
or trametinib ( 31 ). Thirty-six alterations associated with 
response to these agents were detected in 29 cases, in 6 of 11 
evaluated genes (24 shared, 6 only in the primary samples, 
6 only in the brain-metastasis samples;  Fig. 2D ). Activating 
mutations in  KRAS , which have been associated with tumor 
responses to MEK inhibitors ( 39, 40 ), were the most frequent 
alteration in this group (19 cases) and were shared in all clon-
ally related cases. 
 Additional alterations under investigation for association 
with various targeted therapies, including Ephrin inhibi-
tors, epigenetic therapy, Notch inhibitors, WNT inhibitors, 
AURKA inhibitors, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 
MDM inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, as well as alterations that 
might be diagnostic or prognostic, are shown in Supplemen-
tary Fig. S10. 
 Genetic Homogeneity of Brain Metastases 
 The discrepancy in the oncogenic alterations detected in 
clinically obtained samples from the primary tumors and 
matched brain metastases raised the possibility that every 
distinct brain metastasis lesion might harbor a unique set 
of oncogenic alterations. Therefore, we sought to evaluate 
the extent to which clinical sampling of a single brain metas-
tasis region might be representative of the genetic altera-
tions detected across various sites of intracranial metastasis 
( Fig. 3A–G ). We assessed intralesion heterogeneity (by sam-
pling multiple regions of single brain metastases), as well 
as interlesion heterogeneity (by sampling from multiple 
anatomically and temporally distinct brain metastases in 
the same patient). In each scenario, we observed that all 
proﬁ led brain-metastasis samples shared mutations that 
were not detected in the clinically sampled primary tumor, 
indicating that the subclones sampled in these lesions were 
more related to one another than to those detected in the 
primary-tumor sample ( Fig. 3A–G ). Most importantly, the 
brain metastases shared nearly all of the potentially clini-
cally informative driver alterations (29 of 30 alterations in 7 
samples;  Fig. 3A–G ). 
 For four cases ( Fig. 3A–C, and G ; 0302, 0308, 0314, 0137), 
we analyzed multiple regions of the same brain metastasis 
resection. In one example case (0314), we sampled four dis-
tinct regions of a cerebellar metastasis from a patient with 
metastatic HER2-ampliﬁ ed breast cancer ( Fig. 3C ; 314) and 
found that each of these metastatic sites shared a  PIK3CA 
mutation (E542K) and an ampliﬁ cation of  ERBB2 with the 
primary tumor. In addition, we found  CCNE1 and  EGFR 
ampliﬁ cations in all of the metastatic brain lesions that were 
not detected in the primary-tumor sample (Supplementary 
Figs. S12 and S13). The patient ultimately received treatment 
with a PI3K inhibitor, with no evidence of intracranial disease 
progression for 8 months. 
 For four cases ( Fig. 3B, D, E, and G ; 0308, 0098, 0176, 
0137), we obtained and analyzed samples from brain metas-
tases taken prior to treatment and again at the time of 
recurrence. For example, in a patient with a large cell 
neuroendocrine lung cancer (0308;  Fig. 3B ), we sequenced 
resections of brain metastases before and following whole-
brain radiation and found that each sample shared a  MYC 
ampliﬁ cation (six copies) that was not detected in the 
primary-tumor sample ( Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 
S14). In another example, a patient with an estrogen recep-
tor–, progesterone receptor–, and HER2-negative (triple-
negative) breast cancer ( Fig. 3E ; 0176) underwent a resection 
for a symptomatic cerebellar metastasis, and 2 months 
later had a rapid local recurrence, necessitating reresection 
( Fig. 3E ). The primary tumor and brain metastases shared 
alterations in  TP53 ,  PTEN , and  MYC . The primary tumor 
harbored an  MCL1 ampliﬁ cation that was not detected in 
the brain-metastasis samples. We also identiﬁ ed an addi-
tional mutation in  EZH2 (p.N640S; refs.  31 ,  41 ) in both 
brain metastases but failed to detect this mutation in the 
primary-tumor sample. 
 In two cases where anatomically distinct brain metastases 
were resected, we found that they were closely related to one 
another and harbored identical potentially clinically informa-
tive alterations ( Fig. 3F and G ). For example, a patient with 
a  HER2 -ampliﬁ ed salivary gland ductal carcinoma ( Fig. 3F ; 
0138) developed brain metastases while being treated with 
trastuzumab. Analysis of a resected approximately 2 cm 3 
cerebellar metastasis revealed potentially clinically informa-

(Supplementary Figs. S15–S17). Ten months later, following 
whole-brain radiation, the patient underwent a resection of 
a symptomatic parietal lobe metastasis, which shared the 
same ampliﬁ cations. Notably, at the time of progression in 
both brain metastases, there was no evidence of extracranial 
disease, and biopsy of an extracranial site for genetic analysis 
would not have been possible. 
 Brain Metastases Are Genetically Distinct 
from Regional Lymph Nodes and Extracranial 
Metastases 
 Given that brain metastases can be clinically difﬁ cult 
to access in some cases, we evaluated the extent to which 
regional lymph nodes and distal extracranial metastases were 
genetically similar to the brain metastases. We sequenced 
eight cases with at least one additional primary-tumor sam-
ple, regional lymph node, or extracranial metastasis, in addi-
tion to the paired brain metastasis ( Fig. 4A–G ). 
 The extracranial sites exhibited varying degrees of related-
ness to the primary tumor and brain-metastasis samples. 
In four of eight cases, the number of mutations private to 
the brain metastasis sample was greater than the number of 
truncal mutations shared by all samples ( Fig. 4A, C, D, and E ; 
402, 296, 128, 83). Notably, in case 296, broad ampliﬁ cation 
of chromosome 7 (six copies), including the  EGFR locus, was 
detected in the primary-tumor sample, but not in matched 
samples from a regional lymph node or brain metastasis ( Fig. 
4C and Supplementary Fig. S18).

RESEARCH BRIEF
 In 2 of 4 patients with distal extracranial metastases, the 
metastatic sites each harbored an approximately equal or 
greater number of private mutations than the number of 
mutations that were shared (truncal) or private to the brain-
metastasis sample ( Fig. 4D and E ; 0128, 0083). In the third 
case, the clinically sampled primary tumor and lung metas-
tasis shared a common ancestor that harbored mutations 
not detected in the brain-metastasis sample ( Fig. 4F ; 053). 
In the fourth case, the brain and lung metastases shared a 
common ancestor not in common with the primary-tumor 
sample; however, the brain metastasis had more private 
mutations than the primary and lung metastasis combined 
( Fig. 4H ; 0418). 
 In case 441, we sampled two regions of a primary lung 
carcinoma, one before and one after two cycles of neoad-
juvant chemotherapy and chest radiation, in addition to a 
brain metastasis that was diagnosed 5 months later in the 
absence of any extracranial disease ( Fig. 4G ). The two sam-
ples from the primary tumor shared mutations that were 
not detected in the brain-metastasis sample, and the brain 
metastasis harbored mutations of uncertain signiﬁ cance 
in  ALK (P254H),  FBXW7 (R357T), and  FAT1 (R2041fs) 
that were not detected in either primary-tumor samples 
( Fig. 4G ). 
 DISCUSSION 
 Brain metastases represent an unmet need in current onco-
logic care. Approximately 8% to 10% of patients with cancer 
will develop brain metastases, and more than half of these 
patients will die within a few months following diagnosis of 
intracranial metastasis ( 1 ). Genomically guided clinical trials 
have been successful at matching patients to novel targeted 
agents in patients with advanced cancer; however, patients 
with active brain metastases are routinely excluded from these 
trials in part due to the poor correlation between systemic 
response and brain response ( 1 ). Patients will often develop 
progressive brain metastases in the setting of extracranial 
disease that is adequately controlled with existing chemother-
apies or targeted therapies. Historically, this clinical diver-
gence has been ascribed to inadequate systemic therapeutic 
penetration of the blood–brain barrier. The observations 
presented here suggest that additional potentially oncogenic 
alterations may be present in brain metastases, and might 
contribute to this divergence of therapeutic response in some 
of these cases. 
 We note that these mutations may represent precursors in 
the evolutionary process leading to the metastasis; for exam-
ple, they may have driven the proliferation or survival of a 
prometastatic subclone within the primary tumor (that was 
not sampled clinically). Alternately, it is possible that some 
of these alterations were necessary for the establishment of 
the initial metastatic outgrowth in the brain, but not for 
its continued growth or maintenance. In addition, we note 
that it is possible that some of the dependencies associated 
with these alterations may be histology speciﬁ c or depend-
ent on the presence or absence of additional mutations. As 
our study involved a retrospective collection of samples, 
further prospective clinical studies with agents that cross 
the blood–brain barrier will be required to demonstrate that 
these mutations are viable therapeutic targets for patients 
with brain metastases. 
 We found that 46 of 86 (53%) patients harbored a poten-
tially clinically actionable alteration in the brain metastasis 
that was not detected in the clinically sampled primary 
tumor ( Fig. 2 ). These alterations may have critical clinical 
implications because (i) patients often develop brain metas-
tases even when presumably truncal mutations identiﬁ ed 
in the primary tumor are successfully targeted with active 
systemic agents [e.g., BRAF inhibitors ( 42 ), ALK inhibi-
tors ( 43 ), or HER2 inhibitors ( 44 )]; (ii) additional evolu-
tion in the brain metastasis lineage might contribute to 
treatment resistance; (iii) actionable mutations present 
in the brain metastasis cannot be reliably identiﬁ ed on 
the basis of only a single biopsy of the primary tumor 
( Fig. 2 ); and (iv) the primary and metastatic cancer samples 
may be clonally unrelated, as was the case in four of the 
86 cases in our study. Because more than 50% of patients 
with brain metastases will die of intracranial progression, 
targetable alterations present in cancer subclones speciﬁ c 
to the brain metastasis represent an important opportunity 
for novel targeted therapeutic strategies to affect overall 
survival. 
 Tissue from craniotomies provides an immediate oppor-
tunity for more informed decision-making based on 
genomic analysis. Many patients will have a brain metasta-
sis resected as part of clinical care. Current clinical indica-
tions for craniotomies in brain metastases include: need for 
histologic diagnosis; resection of single (25%–50% of brain 
metastases; refs.   45–47 ) or oligometastatic disease in the 
setting of controlled extracranial disease; or resection of a 
symptomatic or dominant lesion in the setting of multiple 
brain metastases. Here, we show that although genetically 
divergent from samples of their primary tumor ( Figs. 1 and 
 2 ), intracranial metastases were remarkably homogenous 
with respect to driver and/or potentially targetable altera-
tions ( Fig. 3 ), a ﬁ nding with implications for the metastatic 
tropism of evolutionary branches that arise early dur-
ing neoplastic development. Practically, this homogeneity 
implies that, when clinically available, characterization of 
even a single brain metastasis lesion may be more informa-
tive than that of a single primary tumor biopsy for selection 
of a targeted therapeutic agent. Notably, regional lymph 
node and distal extracranial metastases were not reliable 
surrogates for the oncogenic alterations found in brain 
metastases ( Fig. 4 ). 
 We note that more comprehensive characterization of the 
primary tumor might reveal subclones that more closely 
resemble intracranial disease. In current clinical practice, 
however, decisions are often made after bulk molecular analy-
sis of only a single biopsy from the primary tumor; without a 
sample of brain metastasis tissue it is impossible to determine 
to what extent genetic alterations in the primary biopsy rep-
resent the divergent evolutionary branch of brain metastases. 
In future studies, analysis of circulating tumor cells or cell-
free DNA (from either blood or cerebrospinal ﬂ uid) should 
be assessed in the context of existing brain-metastasis tissue 
and autopsy studies in order to establish to what extent they

might be informative regarding actionable genomic altera-
tions in brain metastases. 
 METHODS 
 The study was reviewed and approved by the human subjects 
Institutional Review Boards of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute 
(Boston, MA), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Boston, MA), Broad 
Institute of Harvard and MIT (Boston, MA), Massachusetts Gen-
eral Hospital  (Boston, MA), Seoul National University College of 
Medicine (Seoul, South Korea), and Vall d’Hebron University Hos-
pital (Barcelona, Spain). The study was conducted in accordance 
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants. We identiﬁ ed 104 matched brain 
metastases, primary tumors, and normal tissue that were collected 
as part of standard clinical care between 1998 and 2012. In 15 of 
these cases, we collected additional samples including multiple 
brain metastasis lesions (7 cases) and extracranial lesions (8 cases 
with regional lymph node metastases, extracranial metastases, or 
additional primary-tumor tissue). All patients provided written 
informed consent for genetic analysis. Board-certiﬁ ed neuropathol-
ogists (S. Santagata, A. Stemmer-Rachamimov, and D.N. Louis) 
conﬁ rmed the histologic diagnoses and selected representative 
fresh-frozen or formalin-ﬁ xed parafﬁ n-embedded samples that had 
an estimated purity of ≥40%. We performed whole-exome sequenc-
ing of extracted tissue using methods as described on Illumina 
HiSeq or Genome Analyzer IIX platforms ( 48, 49 ). Samples were 
sequenced to median average depth of 108.3X (Supplementary 
Fig. S19). Of the 104 cases, we focused on the 86 (Supplemen-
tary Table S1) that exhibited sufﬁ ciently high purity in both 
the primary and brain-metastasis samples ( 16 ) and for which 
the DNA libraries were of sufﬁ cient quality (Supplementary Fig. 
S19 and Supplementary File S1). Somatic copy-number altera-
tions were inferred from sequencing read depth (Supplementary 
Fig. S8, S9, S12–S18, S20, and Supplementary File S2). In addi-
tion, we performed deep targeted sequencing (median depth 455X) 
on a subset of primary-tumor samples using the Illumina HiSeq 
platform ( 50 ) to conﬁ rm the presence or absence of mutations 
(Supplementary Table S2). Immunohistochemistry for HER2/NEU 
overexpression was used to validate ampliﬁ cation of  ERBB2 in the 
brain metastasis and primary tumor in case 331. 
Additional details regarding materials and methods are provided 
in the Supplementary Methods.

 Branched-Sibling Model 
 In order to address the genetic heterogeneity of cancer-tissue 
samples, we analyzed mutation CCF data to determine whether the 
tissue samples were sufﬁ ciently diverged from one another such 
that no detectable overlap of minor subclones (CCF < 1) occurred, 
a scenario we term the  branched-sibling model (Supplementary Figs. 
S7B, S17A–S17C). In this model, the related cancer-tissue samples 
descend from a common ancestral clone, but each has continued to 
evolve independently with no overlap of subclones in the sampled 
tissues. In this scenario, it is valid to construct standard phylogenetic 
trees relating each tissue sample, with minor subclones (CCF < 1) pri-
vate to each tissue sample represented as subtrees grafted on to each 
sample tip. The branched-sibling scenario implies that such trees 
accurately represent the evolutionary relationship of all subclonal 
populations detected with CCF = 1 in the sampled cancer tissues. A 
corollary of the branched-sibling model is that all mutations shared 
in two or more samples must have CCF = 1 wherever they are present. 
Thus, the appearance of mutations shared in two or more samples 
with CCF < 1 in any of them either represents technical artifact or 
constitutes evidence that the branched-sibling approximation is not 
an accurate description of those samples. Because some degree of 
technical artifact is occasionally expected, due to either sequencing 
errors or incorrect estimation of CCF values, we applied further logi-
cal constraints on the phylogenetic relationships between subclones 
in order to distinguish true violations of the branched-sibling sce-
nario (described below). 
 To analyze the evolutionary relationship between paired primary-
tumor and brain-metastasis samples, we ﬁ rst examined whether 
we could ﬁ nd any cell population in any primary-tumor sample 
that was an ancestor of the metastasis. Such a metastasis-founding 
subclone would harbor mutations in a subset of the cancer cells 
of the primary-tumor sample (CCF primary < 1) that were present 
in all cancer cells (CCF met = 1) of the metastasis sample (violating 
the branched-sibling model; Supplementary Fig. S7C). For each 
patient, we analyzed the two-dimensional CCF distributions of 
point mutations for all unique tissue-sample pairs (Supplementary 
Figs. S1 and S3 and Supplementary File S3) using a previously 
described 2-D Bayesian clustering algorithm (ref. 19; Supplemen-
tary Methods). In most patients, we observed some mutations with 
CCF met = 1 that were not detected in the primary. Similarly, in 
most patients, we observed some mutations with CCF primary = 
1 that were not detected in the paired metastasis. We reasoned that, 
because subclones deﬁ ned by CCF primary < 1 and CCF met = 1 must be 
the evolutionary siblings of subclones deﬁ ned by CCF primary < 1 and 
CCF met = 0, a metastasis-founding subclone could not have been 
present at a detectable fraction in these primary-tumor samples, as 
this subclone would have displaced the mutations exclusive to the 
primary, so that none would have CCF primary = 1 (Supplementary Fig. 
S7B). Thus, the observation of mutation clusters with CCF primary < 1 
and CCF met = 1 in the absence of this displacement was not con-
sidered to be convincing evidence for a branched-sibling violation 
(Supplementary File S3). We recently applied similar analysis to data 
from a mouse model of lung cancer ( 20 ), where a valid metastasis-
founding subclone was detected (Fig. 5 therein); however, we note 
that approximately 50% of the total tumor mass was harvested for 
sequencing in that case. 
 Following similar reasoning, we examined CCF values in all pairs 
of related cancer tissue samples. Most sample-pairs exhibited robust 
mutation clusters with CCF = 1 in one sample that were undetected 
in the other (Supplementary File S3), implying that they were suf-
ﬁ ciently diverged from one another such that no partial-sharing of 
subclones occurred between them. We note that evidence supporting 
partial sharing of subclones between multiple sequenced regions of 
individual brain metastases was observed for some cases, necessitat-
ing special treatment (described below). 
 Phylogenetic Inference on Related 
Cancer-Tissue Samples 
 We created phylogenetic trees using a four-phase process in order 
to (i) be robust to both false-positive and false-negative mutation 
calls; (ii) assign mutations to the correct branches of the tree; (iii) 
distinguish tissue-restricted minor subclones, present in only a sub-
set of the cancer cells in a given sample (CCF < 1); and (iv) identify 
cases where minor subclones were shared by two or more related tis-
sue samples (violating the branched-sibling model) and correct the 
phylogenetic trees accordingly. 
 In the ﬁ rst phase, we sought to ﬁ nd the best phylogenetic tree 
explaining the observed point-mutation data. Somatic point-
mutations were assumed to have arisen uniquely during the clonal

evolution of the cancer, with negligible back-mutation rates, for 
example, due to chromosomal deletion of mutated alleles, which 
did not appear to help explain the data (not shown). We constructed 
a binary matrix of present/absent values for all point mutations 
detected in any of the samples analyzed from a given patient. For 
each sample, absent sites for which paired-detection power was 
<0.7 were removed from consideration, as were sites for which <3 
reads supporting the mutation were observed. We then searched for 
the maximum-parsimony phylogeny using the parsimony-ratchet 
method ( 51 ) on this matrix. 
 In the second phase, we sought to assign mutations to branches 
of the phylogeny inferred in phase I, taking into account uncer-
tainty in the provisional mutation forced calls. We applied the Baye-
sian clustering procedure described in the Supplementary Methods 
to each sample individually, retaining all mutations provisionally 
called with >0 supporting reads in that sample. A single pseudo-
count observation was added having CCF = 1. We then identiﬁ ed 
all provisional mutation calls (>0 supporting reads) made in at 
least two samples of the case that were assigned to a CCF cluster 
with posterior mode < 1.0 (Supplementary Fig. S5A). These muta-
tion calls, which appeared to violate the branched-sibling model 
(described above), were then rejected if the number of supporting 
reads was <3 (Supplementary Fig. S5B). This modiﬁ ed matrix of 
mutation calls was then used to assign each mutation to a branch 
of the phylogenetic tree by assuming that the mutation occurred 
uniquely during clonal evolution and was not subject to back muta-
tion. For each sample, the number of mutations in each category is 
shown in Supplementary Fig. S5C. Assignment of gene-level SCNAs 
to branches was performed in a similar manner (Supplementary 
Fig. S5D). 
 In the third phase, we sought to obtain a more complete descrip-
tion of the genetic divergence between the various tissue samples of 
each case. We reﬁ ned the tips of each phylogenetic tree by distin-
guishing between private mutations that occurred in all cancer cells 
of each sample (CCF = 1) versus those that occurred in a restricted 
subset of sampled cancer cells (CCF < 1). To make this distinction, for 
each sample, we applied the Bayesian clustering technique (described 
in Supplementary Methods) to the private mutations called only 
in that sample. We added  N pseudo-count observations of CCF = 
1, where  N was the number of mutations called in >1 samples of 
the case that were also called in the sample being considered. This 
process partitioned the private mutations into a small number of 
putative subclones having distinct CCF values (Supplementary Fig. 
S4). We then modiﬁ ed the phylogenetic trees by replacing each (non-
germline) tip with a subtree representing the maximally branching 
microphylogeny consistent with the observed set of CCF-cluster val-
ues (i.e., respecting the rule that the sum of sibling subclones cannot 
exceed that of their most recent common ancestor;  Figs. 1 ,  3 ,  and 4 , 
and Supplementary Fig. S6). 
 In the fourth phase, we examined whether evidence that the 
branched-sibling model was not an adequate approximation of the 
sampled cancer tissues could be discerned. We manually reviewed 
detailed plots (Supplementary File S3) showing the estimated 
CCF value of each mutation in each tissue sample, as well as the 
2-D clustering results of mutation CCF values in all unique pairs 
of related tissue samples (Supplementary Fig. S3) for evidence 
of minor subclones (CCF < 1) shared by two or more samples, 
as described above. In two cases in which evidence contradicting 
the branched-sibling model was observed, phylogenetic trees were 
manually adjusted (as described below) to accurately reﬂ ect the 
evolutionary relationship between the different clonal lineages 
as shown in  Fig. 3C and F . This was done in a manner analogous 
to that described in a recent report ( 20 ); here, we extended simi-
lar logic to the scenario where the same subclone was present in 
multiple sequenced tissue samples. Detailed analysis of mutation 
CCFs for each patient, including the automatically generated 
phylogenetic trees (prior to manual adjustment), are available in 
Supplementary File S3. 
 For patient 138 ( Fig. 3F ), samples BM1 region1 and BM1 region2 
shared a minor subclone (subclone1) deﬁ ned by 15 mutations, 
present at CCF = 0.6 in BM1 region 1 and CCF = 0.55 in BM1 
region 2. Because the mutations private to these samples had CCF 
values consistent with being the siblings of subclone1 (CCF = 0.1 
in BM1 region 1 and CCF = 0.3 in BM1 region2), we redrew the 
tree this way. 
 For patient 314 ( Fig. 3C ), samples BM region 2 and BM region 4 
shared a minor subclone (subclone 2) deﬁ ned by eight mutations, 
present at CCF = 0.45 in BM region 2 and CCF = 0.35 in BM region 
4. Samples BM region 1 and BM region 3 shared a minor subclone 
(subclone 1), deﬁ ned by seven mutations, present at CCF = 0.55 in 
BM region 3 and CCF = 0.4 in BM region 1. In addition, BM region 1 and 
BM region 3 appeared to contain a small number of cells (CCF < 0.05) 
from subclone 2. In addition, extreme heterogeneity of primary-tumor 
sample may have resulted in inaccurate CCF values for some muta-
tions, leading to the appearance of a cluster having CCF < 1 in the 
primary and CCF = 1 in all metastasis samples. 
 Patients 176, 302, and 137 showed some evidence consistent with 
shared subclones, but due to the small number of mutations involved 
and the uncertainty in their CCF values, judgments about the validity 
of these branched-sibling violations could not be made with conﬁ -
dence. The trees were therefore left unaltered. 
 In addition, patients 331, 104, 52, 263, and 91 harbored shared 
mutations with CCF < 1. However, they were not logically consistent 
with true violations of the branched-sibling model (e.g., they failed 
to displace private mutations, which were present at CCF = 1 in 
most samples from these cases). This, coupled with the substantial 
heterogeneity of the copy proﬁ les in some of these samples, led us 
to conclude that the appearance of mutations appearing to violate 
the branched-sibling model was due to incorrect estimation of CCF 
values. 
 Prioritization of Clinically Informative Mutations 
Using TARGET 
 To systematically evaluate somatic alterations of potential clini-
cal interest, we used the TARGET database ( 31 ) of genes for which 
somatic alterations have therapeutic or prognostic implications in at 
least one tumor type (Supplementary Table S3). Because the thera-
peutic or prognostic evidence in TARGET is often based on one or a 
few tumor types, we currently do not have evidence that these events 
will be predictive of clinical responses to the indicated targeted thera-
peutic agent in all of the tumor types studied here. Ongoing clinical 
trials to test such hypotheses (“basket trials”) accept any patient with 
a particular alteration regardless of their primary histology. However, 
there is evidence that in some cases, such as for BRAF V600E muta-
tions in colorectal cancer, the responses to therapies targeting the 
same genomic events are histology dependent. 
 Alterations in TARGET genes were prioritized according to 
deﬁ ned criteria ( 31 ). For example, some genes were required to 
have biallelic inactivation, whereas others required ampliﬁ cation 
or speciﬁ c point mutations. In order to nominate a mutation as 
“potentially clinically informative,” we ﬁ rst distinguished between 
heterozygous and homozygous events (in which no reference alleles 
remained in the cancer cells), by analyzing read-counts at mutated 
loci using ABSOLUTE ( 16 ) to account for genomic copy numbers 
and sample purity. 
 We accepted as fulﬁ lling the “biallelic inactivation” TARGET 
criteria genes harboring homozygous loss-of-function (LOF) muta-
tions, homozygous deletion, or two heterozygous LOF mutations. 
LOF mutations were deﬁ ned as: nonsense, frame-shift indel, in-frame

indel, or splice site mutations. To satisfy the “mutation” TARGET 
criteria, we required the presence of at least one identical amino 
acid substitution in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer 
 (COSMIC) database (v67; ref.  52 ). To satisfy the “ampliﬁ cation” 
 TARGET criteria, we required a gene-level somatic copy-number 
alteration call of either “ampliﬁ cation” or “high-level ampliﬁ cation” 
(as described above).
