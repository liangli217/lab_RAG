 ABSTRACT 
 Pediatric Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the expression of chimeric fusions of 
EWS and ETS family transcription factors, representing a paradigm for studying 
cancers driven by transcription factor rearrangements. In this study, we describe the somatic landscape 
of pediatric Ewing sarcoma. These tumors are among the most genetically normal cancers character-
ized to date, with only  EWS – ETS rearrangements identiﬁ ed in the majority of tumors . STAG2 loss, how-
ever, is present in more than 15% of Ewing sarcoma tumors; occurs by point mutation, rearrangement, 
and likely nongenetic mechanisms; and is associated with disease dissemination. Perhaps the most 
striking ﬁ nding is the paucity of mutations in immediately targetable signal transduction pathways, 
highlighting the need for new therapeutic approaches to target  EWS – ETS fusions in this disease. 
 SIGNIFICANCE: We performed next-generation sequencing of Ewing sarcoma, a pediatric cancer 
involving bone, characterized by expression of  EWS – ETS fusions. We found remarkably few mutations. 
However, we discovered that loss of STAG2 expression occurs in 15% of tumors and is associated with 
metastatic disease, suggesting a potential genetic vulnerability in Ewing sarcoma .  Cancer Discov; 4(11);

 INTRODUCTION 
 The sequencing of cancer genomes in aggressive pediatric 
solid tumors, such as rhabdoid tumors and retinoblastoma, 
has revealed remarkably stable genomes ( 1, 2 ). In both cases, 
oncogenesis is thought, at least in part, to be driven by epi-
genetic deregulation. It has been hypothesized that pediatric 
solid tumors notable for recurrent translocations involving 
transcription factors will also have relatively stable genomes, 
as has already been observed in acute myeloid leukemia and 
rhabdomyosarcoma with recurrent cytogenetic transloca-
tions ( 3, 4 ). Studies to systematically address this hypothesis 
are just beginning to emerge. Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive, 
poorly differentiated tumor, typically arising from bone, and 
is characterized by highly recurrent translocations involv-
ing ETS transcription factors, with  EWS – FLI and  EWS – ERG 
translocations being the most common ( 5, 6 ). Ewing sarcoma 
cells have a strict dependency on EWS–ETS fusion proteins, 
supporting the notion that these translocations are a critical 
oncogenic event in this disease ( 7 ). Although the  EWS – FLI
rearrangement was described over 20 years ago, effective 
therapy directly targeting this transcription factor abnormal-
ity has yet to be developed. New therapeutic strategies for 
this disease are needed because the vast majority of children 
with metastatic or relapsed Ewing sarcoma will die despite 
intensive, multimodality therapy ( 8, 9 ). Moreover, even for 
children who are cured, the long-term morbidity of cytotoxic 
treatment is signiﬁ cant ( 10 ). 
 Efforts to discover collaborating, and potentially targeta-
ble, genetic alterations in Ewing sarcoma tumors have pri-
marily focused on the study of copy-number alterations, with 
several studies reporting copy-number gains of chromosome 
8 in nearly 50% of tumors ( 11 ). However, with the exception 
of focal deletions at the  CDKN2A locus on 9p21, speciﬁ c 
genes of relevance have yet to be elucidated from these studies 
( 12, 13 ). Furthermore, few recurrent somatic mutations have 
been reported in Ewing sarcoma, with the notable exceptions 
of  TP53 (5%–20%) and more recently the cohesin complex 
family member  STAG2 (20%), with neither of these immi-
nently druggable ( 13–16 ). We sought to deﬁ ne the genomic 
landscape of pediatric Ewing sarcoma by integrating multiple 
next-generation sequencing methods applied to a large panel 
of human Ewing sarcoma tumors. 
 RESULTS 
 Massively Parallel Sequencing of Ewing Sarcoma 
 We collected 116 pediatric Ewing sarcoma tumors from 
112 patients and extracted high-quality DNA from 96 tumors 
for sequencing, including 4 patients with multiple tumors. 
Clinical data and demographics were available for a subset 
of these patients, which were consistent with epidemiologic 
studies of pediatric Ewing sarcoma ( Table 1 and Supplemen-
tary Table S1A–S1D; ref.  17 ). We performed whole-exome 
sequencing (WES) of tumor–normal pairs from 26 patients,

tumors from 66 patients, and 11 cell lines. We also performed 
whole-genome sequencing (WGS), genotyping array (SNP 
array), and transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) on a subset 
of these samples ( Fig. 1A ; Supplementary Fig. S1; Supple-
mentary Table S1A–S1D) . We found only 12 genes with non-
silent mutations in more than one sample of the 26 tumors 
with normal controls and found that  EWS – ETS transloca-
tions were the only recurrent rearrangements identiﬁ ed from 
WGS and RNASeq (Supplementary Tables S2A–S2D, S3, and 
S4A–S4D). Although all recurrent mutations were detected 
in WES, only ﬁ ve of these genes ( ERF ,  BCORL1 , and  TP53 
were mutated in 2 of 26 tumors and  MLL2 and  STAG2 in 3 of 
26 tumors) had mutations that were conﬁ rmed in a comple-
mentary sequencing approach (WGS or RNASeq) and were 
predicted to be expressed by RNASeq ( Fig. 1A ; Supplemen-
tary Table S3; Supplementary Fig. S2). We also identiﬁ ed 10 
genes with mutation sites listed in the Catalogue of Somatic 
Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC; v51), but of these only  TP53 
was mutated in more than one sample (Supplementary Table 
S2A–S2D; ref.  18 ). We used the MutSig 2CV algorithm to 
detect signiﬁ cantly mutated genes from 26 tumors with 
normal pairs and found that only  STAG2 was signiﬁ cantly 
mutated (Supplementary Table S5; ref.  19 ). With an overall 
mutation rate of 0.62 mutations per megabase (Mb), this 
analysis had 90% power to detect signiﬁ cantly mutated genes 
present in 30% or more of patients (Supplementary Fig. S3; 
Supplementary Table S6A; ref.  19 ). 
 To increase our power to detect less commonly mutated 
genes, we developed an approach to analyze WES for Ewing 
sarcoma tumors for which normal pairs were unavailable. 
This allowed us to extend our discovery set from 26 to 
92  tumors. Standard alignment and analysis of WES data 
from 66 tumors without normal pairs yielded an average of 
521 variants per Mb. Recognizing that these variants are com-
posed of germline events and artifacts, in addition to somatic 
mutations, we ﬁ ltered these data against common germline 
variants in the 1000 Genome Project and Exome Sequencing 
Project (ESP) as well as a panel of more than 2,900 normal 
exomes to remove germline events and recurrent artifacts, 
which reduced this rate to 6.1 variants/Mb (Supplementary 
Tables S6B and S7; refs.  20, 21 ). After combining these 
results with the 26 tumor–normal pairs (also now ﬁ ltered 
by the panel of normal samples), the entire cohort had an 
average variant rate of 4.6/Mb. This improved our sensitivity 
to detect signiﬁ cantly mutated genes (90% power) present in 
15% or more of patients (Supplementary Fig. S3; ref.  19 ). We 
hypothesized that the remaining rare germline events would 
be widely distributed across the exomes, allowing MutSig to 
detect signiﬁ cant somatic events. Variants were analyzed with 
the MutSig 2CV algorithm, and consistent with the above 
hypothesis, only four signiﬁ cantly mutated genes were identi-
ﬁ ed (Supplementary Table S8).  STAG2 and  TP53 were the only 
two genes known to be cancer-associated.  RPTN , a member of 
the epidermal differentiation complex, and  PRB2 , a member 
of the human salivary proline-rich protein family, were also 
signiﬁ cantly mutated on the basis of this analysis ( 22, 23 ). 
Neither of these genes, however, was expressed in any of the 
Ewing sarcoma tumors or cell lines based on the RNASeq 
data, suggesting that these variants are unlikely to be driver 
events in Ewing sarcoma. These results conﬁ rm that there are 
few signiﬁ cantly mutated genes in Ewing sarcoma other than 
 EWS – ETS rearrangements at frequencies greater than 15%. 
 We also noted a stark paucity of mutations in genes 
involved in signaling pathways. In fact, of the 26 tumor–
normal pairs,  EPHA7 was the only tyrosine kinase recur-
rently mutated, and there was only 1 patient (SJDES001-R) 
with a candidate targetable lesion ( PTEN mutation coupled 
with deletion of the other allele). Furthermore, there was no 
enrichment of mutated genes in gene signatures deﬁ ned by 
tyrosine kinase activity or pathways reported to be active in 
Ewing sarcoma (i.e., GLI1, MAPK, and PI3K–AKT–mTOR 
pathways) when considering either the 26 tumors with nor-
mal pairs or the entire collection of 92 tumors (Supplemen-
tary Table S9; refs.  24–32 ). Given the lack of highly recurrent 
mutations, it is also notable that there was no enrichment of 
mutations in chromatin-modifying genes. 
 Finally, somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA) were 
identiﬁ ed from SNP-array data and by read-depth analysis 
of WES data. GISTIC2.0 analysis identiﬁ ed signiﬁ cant copy-
number gains of chromosome 8 in 45% (41 of 92) of cases 
and focal deletions at 9p21.3 in 28% of tumors (5 of 18 by 
SNP array and 22% or 20 of 92 by SNP array plus WES), con-
sistent with loss of  CDKN2A ( Fig. 1A–C ; Supplementary Fig. 
S4A; Supplementary Table S10; ref.  33 ). No signiﬁ cant focal 
ampliﬁ cations were found. One recent study reported recur-
rent focal deletions of  SMARCB1 and  RELN in Ewing sarcoma 
tumors, but we were unable to identify these aberrancies by 
SNP array or WES in our cohort ( 34 ). As pointed out by the 
authors of this previously published study, these deletions 
may be more prevalent in Ewing sarcoma tumors with either 
atypical features or mixed features of both Ewing sarcoma 
and rhabdoid. 
 Signiﬁ cantly Mutated Genes in Ewing Sarcoma 
 Mutations in  TP53 have been reported in 3% to 14% of 
Ewing sarcoma tumors ( 13, 14 ). We found nonsilent coding 
aberrancies of  TP53 in 6% [6 of 96 samples including the

or disease recurrence than in the initiation of Ewing sarcoma, 
as previously suggested in the literature ( 13 ). 
 Mutations in  STAG2 were recently identiﬁ ed in several types 
of cancer, including Ewing sarcoma ( 4 ,  15 ,  16 ,  35–37 ). We iden-
tiﬁ ed eight nonsilent single-nucleotide variants (SNV) or indels 
in  STAG2 in 96 tumors, including two distinct  STAG2 muta-
tions in separate relapses from the same patient (SJDES007-R1 
and SJDES007-R2), as well as a previously unreported  STAG2 –
 MAP7D3 fusion in a Ewing sarcoma cell line ( Fig. 1A and D 
and Supplementary Table S11A–S11D) . We measured STAG2 
expression by IHC in 73 tumors (including an extension cohort 
of 20 tumors not sequenced) and found that 15% (11 of 73; 
95% CI, 8%–25%) of tumors had complete or heterogeneous 
loss of STAG2 expression. We also demonstrated loss of full-
length STAG2 expression in Ewing sarcoma cell lines by IHC 
and/or Western immunoblotting and conﬁ rmed that TTC466 
expressed  STAG2 – MAP7D3 fusion transcripts, resulting in 
a loss of STAG2 expression ( Fig. 2A–C and Supplementary 
Tables S4D and S12). Interestingly, one tumor and three cell 
lines were observed to have loss of STAG2 expression without 
evidence of somatic mutations, suggesting that there are other 
mechanisms of STAG2 silencing in Ewing sarcoma. 
 In recent studies, there have been conﬂ icting reports about 
the association of STAG2 loss with increased aneuploidy in 
cancer ( 15 ,  35 ,  36 ,  38 ). We found that tumors with loss of 
STAG2 expression had a slightly higher mean proportion of 
the genome with SCNAs (0.15 for STAG2 positive vs. 0.36 for 
STAG2 loss;  P = 0.009 by Mann–Whitney test) but no differ-
ence in ploidy ( Fig. 2D and E ). However, we also noted that 
some  STAG2 mutations were identiﬁ ed in tumors with  TP53 
mutations and/or from patients who had previously received 
treatment, factors known to induce chromosomal instability. 
In fact, we found that  TP53 mutations occurred signiﬁ cantly 
more often than expected in samples with aberrant STAG2, 
as determined by IHC or by the identiﬁ cation of a mutation 
when IHC was unavailable ( P = 0.014 by Fisher exact test). 
When limiting our analysis to tumors that are  TP53 wild-
type and obtained at diagnosis, we found that there was no 
signiﬁ cant difference in the rate of SCNAs in tumors with or 
without loss of STAG2 expression (0.14 for STAG2 positive 
vs. 0.27 for STAG2 loss;  P = 0.108 by Mann–Whitney test; 
 Fig. 2F ). Furthermore, we did not observe any copy-number 
changes in one tumor sample with a clonal  STAG2 mutation 
(SJDES006; Supplementary Fig. S4A). Rather, we observed 
that 88% of patients (7 out of 8; 95% CI, 47%–100%) with 
STAG2 loss at the time of diagnosis also presented with clini-
cal evidence of metastatic disease compared with only 27% 
(14 of 51; 95% CI, 16%–42%) of those whose diagnostic tumor 
sample expressed STAG2 ( P = 0.002 by Fisher exact test), 
demonstrating that STAG2 loss is associated with disease 
dissemination in Ewing sarcoma ( Fig. 2G ). Furthermore, we 
also performed single-sample gene set enrichment analysis 
(ssGSEA) to identify gene signatures that were enriched in 
samples with STAG2 loss versus STAG2 expression. Because 
of the small number of tumors with both loss of STAG2 
expression and available RNASeq data, we combined RNASeq 
data from tumors and cell lines for this analysis. Two of the 
11 signatures that are enriched in samples with loss of STAG2 
expression were gene sets associated with metastasis in cancer 
( Fig. 2H–J and Supplementary Table S13). 
 Alterations in ETS Transcription Factors 
 We identiﬁ ed  EWS – ETS rearrangements for all samples with 
WGS and  EWS – ETS fusion transcripts in all samples with 
RNASeq data (Supplementary Table S4A–S4C). Reciprocal 
 ETS – EWS fusion transcripts were detected in only four sam-
ples, each with ﬁ ve or fewer reads. In some cases, RNASeq 
detected multiple  EWS – ETS fusions, a phenomenon previously 
reported in Ewing sarcoma ( 39–41 ). In all samples, at least one 
fusion variant was expected to result in the translation of the 
ETS portion of the chimeric protein in-frame. These in-frame 
variants were always found to have higher expression than out-
of-frame variants in these samples, reafﬁ rming that alternative 
splicing is an effective mechanism for expressing EWS–ETS 
fusion proteins for rearrangements otherwise predicted to 
yield out-of-frame and truncated fusion forms ( P < 0.0001 
by Mann–Whitney test; Supplementary Table S4C). We also 
found that wild-type  FLI and  ERG exons were poorly expressed 
in  EWS – ETS –expressing tumors ( Fig. 3A–C and Supplemen-
tary Table S14A and S14B). These data indicate that  EWS – ETS 
rearrangements are necessary for the expression of  FLI and 
 ERG and that alternative splicing of  EWS – ETS rearrangements 
is sometimes necessary for the in-frame translation of these 
ETS transcription factors in Ewing sarcoma. 
 Recent work in prostate cancer demonstrated that nonrear-
ranged  ETS transcription factor aberrancies play a role in the 
development of disease even in tumors expressing  ETS fusions 
and that ETS2 repressor factor ( ERF ) expression has also been 
reported to attenuate  ETS -associated tumorigenesis ( 42, 43 ). 
Therefore, we looked for evidence of other  ETS aberrancies in 
our samples. Although mutations in  ETS family genes were not 
statistically enriched among the 92 tumors sequenced by GSEA, 
we identiﬁ ed three samples with nonsilent coding variants in 
 ERF (3%; 3 of 92; 95% CI, 1%–9%), leading to a relative decre-
ment in the expression of the  ERF transcript for the only patient 
with RNASeq data and an  ERF mutation, SJDES012 [reads 
per kilobase per million (RPKM) = 20.7, wild-type  ERF RPKM; 
range, 23.3–57.6; Supplementary Table S11A–S11D]. We also 
identiﬁ ed recurrent, focal deletions of the  ETS1 gene (11%; 10 
out of 92; 95% CI, 5%–19%), originating at the  FLI breakpoint, 
in Ewing sarcoma tumors. None of these samples, however, had 
RNA available for determining the effect of deletion on  ETS1 
expression, and we did not identify point mutations in this gene 
(Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary Table S15). 
 Ewing Sarcoma Genomics after Treatment 
and in Established Cell Lines 
 Of the 26 tumors with available normal controls, 16 patients 
were sampled at diagnosis and eight sampled after treatment. 
For this cohort, upfront treatment used the same chemo-
therapy agents for all patients except one (Supplementary 
Table S1A–S1D). Diagnostic and treated tumors differed sig-
niﬁ cantly in their mutation rates (0.37 vs. 1.11 mutations per 
Mb, respectively;  P = 0.0017 by Mann–Whitney test;  Fig. 4A 
and B ; Supplementary Table S6A). SNVs were predominantly 
C to T transitions with the majority subcategorized as *CpG 
to T mutations, a common pattern attributed to spontaneous 
deamination of 5-methyl-cytosine and associated with cancers 
with high levels of methylation ( 44, 45 ). In treated tumors, 
there was a relative increase in substitutions of cytosine at TpC

dinucleotides, a pattern attributed to the activity of APOBEC 
enzymes in regions of DNA damage. However, there was no evi-
dence of kataegis or increase in APOBEC expression in treated 
samples, patterns usually associated with APOBEC-induced 
mutations ( Fig. 4C and D ; refs.  44–47 ). Although the analysis 
of translocations was limited by the relative paucity of WGS 
samples, there was a trend toward an increased number of rear-
rangements in treated samples compared with diagnostic sam-
ples, but there was no evidence of chromothripsis ( P = 0.057 by 
Mann–Whitney test;  Fig. 4E and F ; Supplementary Table S4A 
and S4B; ref.  48 ). Finally, there was also a trend toward a higher 
proportion of the genome in regions of SCNAs in tumors from 
patients who had previously received treatment (0.17 diagnos-
tic vs. 0.27 relapse;  P = 0.161 by Mann–Whitney test), although 
no change in tumor ploidy was observed (Supplementary 
Fig. S6A and S6B). We also found that copy-number gains of 
chromosome 1q were signiﬁ cantly more common in treated 
samples (50%; 4 of 8; 95% CI, 16%–84%) than in diagnostic sam-
ples (14%; 7 of 51; 95% CI, 6%–26%;  P = 0.03 by Fisher exact test). 
In aggregate, both sequencing and copy-number data demon-
strate that anti-Ewing treatment regimens are associated with 
an increase in somatic aberrancies in Ewing sarcoma tumors. 
 To determine whether well-established Ewing sarcoma cell 
lines have retained features of Ewing sarcoma tumors, we 
analyzed WES, SNP-array, RNASeq, IHC, and Western blot 
analysis data from 11 cell lines (Supplementary Table S1C). 
Because paired normal controls for cell lines are unavailable, 
WES data were subjected to the same ﬁ ltering process as 
tumors for which we did not have matched normal samples 
(Supplementary Table S16). We detected an  EWS – ETS fusion 
for all cell lines with RNASeq data (Supplementary Table S4C). 
We found a signiﬁ cantly increased rate of  STAG2 mutations 
(36%; 4 of 11; 95% CI, 11%–69%;  P = 0.016), STAG2 loss by 
Western blot analysis or IHC (70%; 7 of 10; 95% CI, 35%–93%; 
 P = 0.0006),  TP53 mutations (64%; 7 of 11; 95% CI, 31%–89%; 
 P < 0.0001),  CDKN2A deletion (55%; 6 of 11; 95% CI, 23%–83%; 
 P = 0.028), and chromosome 1q copy-number gain (55%; 6 of 
11; 95% CI, 23%–83%;  P = 0.011) in cell lines compared with 
tumor samples by the Fisher exact test. There was no signiﬁ -
cant difference in the rate of copy-number gains of chromo-
some 8 (6 of 11), and although there were more cell lines from 
females (8 of 11) than from males, this did not reach statistical 
signiﬁ cance when compared with the gender of patients in 
our study ( Fig. 5A ). We also performed principal component 
analysis using the RNASeq data from all tumors and cell lines. 
Projection of the ﬁ rst two principal components, accounting 
for the largest amount of variance in the samples, revealed 
that cell lines and tumors clustered separately ( Fig. 5B ). How-
ever, only the ﬁ rst principal component (PC1) was found to 
signiﬁ cantly discriminate tumors and cell lines ( P < 1 × 10 −14 
 Figure 3.   Wild-type  ETS genes are not expressed in Ewing sarcoma. A, schematic depicts the generation of gene-level and pre/postfusion RPKMs for 
 EWS and  ETS genes ( FLI and  ERG ) from Ewing sarcoma tumor samples. Gene-level RPKMs for  ETS genes (green) are derived from all exons for that gene. 
Reads generated from the wild-type allele or translocated allele cannot be distinguished. Prefusion  EWS RPKMs (blue) are generated from all reads that 
map to the exons before the site of the  EWS – ETS breakpoint (reads from rearranged and wild-type alleles cannot be distinguished). Postfusion  EWS 
RPKMs (top, black) map to exons after the breakpoint. Prefusion  ETS RPKMs (bottom, black) are derived from alleles before the  EWS – ETS breakpoint. 
Postfusion  ETS RPKMs (red) are derived from exons after the breakpoint (reads from the rearranged and wild-type alleles cannot be distinguished). 
B, left, gene-level RPKMs for  FLI are plotted for each tumor with available RNASeq data. Tumors are grouped by whether they express a  EWS – FLI or 
 EWS – ERG fusion. Right, gene-level RPKMs for  ERG are plotted for each tumor and grouped by fusion type. C, left, prefusion and postfusion  EWS RPKMs 
for all tumors with RNASeq data. Because postfusion exons are not involved in the  EWS – ETS rearrangement, expression of these exons indicates the 
expression of the wild-type  EWS allele. Middle, prefusion and postfusion  FLI RPKMs for  EWS – FLI rearranged tumors. Right, prefusion and postfusion 
 ERG RPKMs for  EWS – ERG rearranged tumors. Expression of prefusion  ETS exons depends on the wild-type promoter. Thus, prefusion RPKMs reﬂ ect 
expression of wild-type  ETS alleles.

by the Student  t test;  Fig. 5C ). We then applied ssGSEA after 
ranking the genes by their weighted contribution to PC1 and 
found that cell lines were enriched for gene sets associated 
with cell proliferation and metabolism, whereas tumors were 
enriched for gene sets associated with the immune system 
or signaling from the extracellular matrix ( Fig. 5D and Sup-
plementary Table S17). In summary, these data suggest that 
although Ewing sarcoma cell lines possess the spectrum of 
recurrent molecular events observed in EWS–ETS–positive pri-
mary tumors, they may be more representative of high-risk 
disease because aberrancies associated with aggressive disease 
(e.g.,  TP53 mutations and  CDKN2A deletions) occur at a higher 
frequency in the cell lines. Moreover, the transcriptional analy-
sis suggests, not surprisingly, that there is an interaction of 
the primary tumors with the microenvironment, including 
inﬁ ltration with immune cells, and that there are differences 
in growth properties between cell lines and primary Ewing sar-
coma tumors . However, additional differences in transcription 
between the two were not identiﬁ ed in our analysis, supporting 
the notion that other aspects of cell line transcriptional pro-
gramming may more faithfully model tumor biology.

Tables  S1D and S18). To explore clonal evolution, we esti-
mated the cancer cell fraction (CCF; fraction of tumor cells 
containing each SNV and indel) for mutations in each tumor 
( 49 ). For both patients, it was notable that there were muta-
tions at diagnosis predicted to be clonal or near-clonal (by a 
CCF > 0.9) that were not identiﬁ ed in the metastatic recurrent 
tumor samples, suggesting either that mutational heteroge-
neity in the diagnostic sample was not detectable by stand-
ard tissue sampling techniques and sequencing read depth 
or that metastasis occurred early in disease development, 
before the emergence of the dominant clone in the primary 
tumor ( Fig. 6A ). As might be expected, a portion of subclonal

STAG2 expression) that cannot be 100% clonal due to the presence of different  STAG2 mutations at R1 and R2. The presence of clonal mutations in R1 
that are not present in R2 (and vice versa) suggest that local relapses emerge from cells that have diverged from the primary tumor.

 mutations at diagnosis became clonal at relapse, and recur-
rent metastatic tumors acquired new mutations. For two 
additional patients, we were unable to obtain diagnostic sam-
ples for sequencing but were able to sequence tumors from 
separate relapses (Supplementary Fig. S7B and Supplemen-
tary Tables S1D and S18). In both cases, relapses were local 
to the site of the diagnostic tumor, but there was remarkably 
little overlap in the mutations identiﬁ ed at the ﬁ rst relapse 
(R1) compared with the subsequent relapse (R2). For patient 
SJDES007, we conﬁ rmed that the same genomic  EWS – FLI 
breakpoint identiﬁ ed by WGS in R1 was also present in R2, 
suggesting that these were not independent occurrences of 
Ewing sarcoma in the same patient. These ﬁ ndings indicate 
that tumor heterogeneity in the primary tumor inﬂ uences the 
mutational proﬁ le of tumors at relapse ( Fig. 6B ). 
 One striking observation from patient SJDES007 was the 
ﬁ nding that the  TP53 and  STAG2 mutations identiﬁ ed in 
tumor R1 were not detected at R2. Instead, mutations at dif-
ferent sites were detected in both of these genes at R2. This 
convergent evolution is consistent with the ﬁ nding that muta-
tions in these genes may co-occur more often than expected 
by chance and suggests that they play an important role 
in relapse ( Fig. 6B and Supplementary Table S11A–S11D). 
Although copy-number loss in R2 could account for the loss 
of the  TP53 mutation initially seen in R1, copy-number loss is 
unlikely to explain the presence of different  STAG2 mutations 
in tumors R1 and R2 because the  STAG2 gene is located on 
the X chromosome and this is a male patient (Supplementary 
Fig. S7B). In fact, the absence of STAG2 expression in the 
diagnostic sample (determined by IHC staining of a formalin-
ﬁ xed parafﬁ n-embedded sample; Supplementary Table S12) 
suggests that the tumor populations that gave rise to each 
relapse had diverged before diagnosis, further supporting 
the notion that tumor heterogeneity at diagnosis inﬂ uences 
tumor evolution at relapse. Finally, sequencing of tumors 
sampled at R1 and R2 from patient SJDES014, an infant with 
multiply relapsed chest wall Ewing sarcoma, demonstrated 
that the  EWS – FLI rearrangement was the only somatic muta-
tion in common to both relapses ( Fig. 6B and Supplementary 
Tables S2B, S4C, and S18). Although analysis of this patient’s 
normal exome did not reveal a mutation associated with a 
known cancer predisposition, the patient’s unusually young 
age at diagnosis and the absence of other clonal, tumor-
initiating events leads us to speculate that germline variants 
or lineage-speciﬁ c epigenetic changes may play an important 
role in Ewing sarcoma oncogenesis for some patients. 
 DISCUSSION 
 One ongoing debate in the pediatric oncology community 
has focused on the utility of clinical-grade deep sequencing 
of pediatric tumors to enable molecularly informed therapy, 
matching genetic lesions with targeted drugs. In this regard, 
our study reveals that Ewing sarcoma genomes are among 
the most simple reported to date and demonstrates a marked 
paucity of mutations in immediately targetable pathways, 
such as mutations in the MAPK or PI3K–AKT–mTOR path-
ways. In the case of MAPK pathway mutations, a similar 
observation was made in prostate cancer in which mutations 
in the MAPK pathway were rare and observed only in ETS 
fusion-negative tumors ( 43 ). Indeed, it has been suggested 
that oncogenic ETS proteins can replace the need for MAPK 
pathway mutations by the upregulation of a MAPK tran-
scriptional program ( 50 ). At relapse, the frequency of genetic 
aberrancies is signiﬁ cantly higher, although the paucity of 
targetable lesions remains a challenge. This does raise the 
point, however, that diagnostic and relapsed tumors are quite 
different, supporting the notion that relapsed tissue warrants 
biopsy and genomic characterization for optimal precision-
based therapy in the future. 
 On the one hand, the simplicity of the Ewing sarcoma 
genome is disquieting in that there is not an immediately 
translatable intervention. In addition, in the two cases with 
paired relapse samples from the same patient, only the 
minority of mutations were present in both relapses. These 
results, however, do speak to the critical importance of under-
standing and either directly targeting the  EWS – ETS fusion 
event in this disease or identifying synthetic lethal vulner-
abilities in the presence of these fusion proteins. Toward 
this end, by integrating multiple genomic approaches, we 
addressed several previously outstanding questions regard-
ing the  EWS – ETS fusions in Ewing sarcoma tumors. First, in 
Ewing sarcoma, the reciprocal fusion,  ETS – EWS , is generally 
not expressed and thus unlikely to be relevant to disease 
pathogenesis. This is in contrast to other fusions, such as 
 PML – RARA in acute promyelocytic leukemia, in which the 
reciprocal fusion is thought to be critical to leukemogenesis 
( 51 ). Second, although wild-type  EWS is highly expressed in 
Ewing sarcoma tumors, both wild-type  FLI and wild-type 
 ERG are poorly expressed. Third, our data highlight the need 
to better understand the role of nonrearranged  ETS genes in 
Ewing sarcoma even beyond the expressed EWS–ETS fusion 
proteins. 
 One of the most striking recurrent events found in our 
sequencing effort was mutations or rearrangements of the 
 STAG2 gene. In further support of a functional relevance 
of  STAG2 to Ewing sarcoma is the ﬁ nding of unique  STAG2 
mutations at different relapses in 1 patient. Moreover, the 
co-occurrence of these mutations with unique mutations in 
 TP53 at each relapse supports a likely functional interaction 
of these two events in promoting disease recurrence. Indeed, 
 co-occurrence of  STAG2 and  TP53 mutations was observed 
more often than expected by chance in Ewing sarcoma tumors. 
All frameshift and nonsense mutations in  STAG2 resulted in 
the loss of protein expression in Ewing sarcoma tumors with 
sufﬁ cient tissue for evaluation by IHC. Moreover, we observed 
additional samples with loss of STAG2 expression despite 
normal coding sequences. STAG2 is a member of the cohesin 
complex, a multimeric complex consisting of at least four 
core proteins: a heterodimer of SMC1 and SMC3 forming 
a hinged ring-like structure and two “clasp” proteins, STAG 
and RAD21 ( 52, 53 ). Although mutations in multiple mem-
bers of the cohesin complex have been reported in cancer, in 
this collection of Ewing sarcoma tumors, we observed recur-
rent mutations only in  STAG2 , consistent with recent reports 
( 4 ,  16 ,  54, 55 ). The cohesin complex is known to play a role 
in the regulation of sister chromatid exchange during mito-
sis and meiosis, and in some reports, mutations in  STAG2 
are associated with aneuploidy ( 15 ,  36 ). In Ewing sarcoma 
tumors, however, there was no difference in tumor ploidy

among tumors expressing STAG2 or those with STAG2 loss. 
Furthermore, we have identiﬁ ed a  STAG2 mutation in one 
tumor sample with no copy-number alterations, suggesting 
that the loss of STAG2 expression likely contributes to dis-
ease pathogenesis or progression through other mechanisms. 
One alternative hypothesis is that mutations in  STAG2 lead to 
altered chromatin architecture and transcription, a putative 
mechanism in the developmental disorders characterized by 
mutations in the cohesin complex, such as Cornelia de Lange 
Syndrome and Roberts Syndrome ( 53 ,  56–59 ). Moreover, 
despite a small sample size, it is notable that 88% of patients 
with STAG2 loss at diagnosis also had metastatic disease, 
in comparison to only 27% of patients with tumors express-
ing STAG2. Because of a lack of available follow-up data for 
the majority of patients whose tumors were included in this 
study, we were unable to deﬁ nitively demonstrate that these 
patients had a worse outcome. Although metastatic disease 
is currently the most predictive marker of poor prognosis 
in Ewing sarcoma, this hypothesis will need veriﬁ cation in a 
larger cohort. Thus, although loss-of-function mutations of 
 STAG2 in Ewing sarcoma may portend a poor prognosis, it 
may also impart a new, targetable vulnerability for the devel-
opment of alternative treatment strategies. 
 In this study, we also identiﬁ ed rare, recurrent mutations 
in genes such as  BCORL1 ,  MLL2 , and  ERF , which did not 
reach statistical signiﬁ cance in this dataset. Indeed, one of the 
shortcomings of comprehensive sequencing efforts for rare 
pediatric tumors, such as this study, is the lack of adequate 
samples to power the discovery of rare events. Assuming 
a stable mutational frequency of 0.62 mutations per Mb, 
we would need to sequence more than 200 tumor/normal 
pairs to have 90% power to identify mutations present in 
5% of patients and approximately 500 samples to detect sig-
niﬁ cant events in 3% of patients ( 19 ). With an incidence of 
approximately 250 cases in the United States per year, such 
an analysis will require a large multi-institutional effort or 
meta-analysis as data from other Ewing sarcoma sequenc-
ing projects become available. However, we present here a 
novel approach to utilizing tumors acquired from pathologic 
discards that do not have paired normal tissue. Although 
we expect to see an increase in false positives using this 
approach, this analysis increased our conﬁ dence that we were 
not “missing” signiﬁ cantly mutated, well-validated cancer-
associated genes expected to occur in 15% or more of patients 
with Ewing sarcoma. It is yet to be seen whether this method 
will be as informative for other cancer types, particularly 
those with a much higher rate of somatic mutations. A 
second shortcoming of our study is the lack of deep clinical 
information for many of the samples. Prospective studies 
to deﬁ nitively address the relevance of STAG2 aberrancy on 
long-term survival, for example, will be of future interest. 
 In summary, we report a massively parallel sequencing 
analysis of  ETS -rearranged Ewing sarcoma tumors and reveal 
remarkably quiet genomes at the time of diagnosis. We 
note nearly a 3-fold increase in the mutation rate of tumors 
posttreatment, underscoring the notion that relapsed dis-
ease is genetically different from disease at diagnosis and 
lending support to the debate about re-biopsy of pediatric 
solid tumors at time of relapse. These studies emphasize the 
importance of tackling the  EWS – ETS fusion as a drug target 
and also shed light on cohesin defects as another potential 
vulnerability in this disease. 
 METHODS 
 Samples 
 Tumor tissue and matched blood from patients with Ewing 
sarcoma were collected with informed consent under a Hospital 
Sant Joan de Déu (Barcelona, Spain), Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)–approved protocol . Additional tumor tissue samples were col-
lected on an IRB-approved tissue discard protocol from Boston 
Children’s Hospital (Boston, MA) and acquired through the Coop-
erative Human Tissue Network, Southern Division (Birmingham, 
AL). Protocols were reviewed and approved by the Broad Institute’s 
(Cambridge, MA) IRB. DNA and RNA were extracted from tumors 
and cell lines using standard techniques. 
 Massively Parallel Sequencing 
 Whole-exome sequencing  Library construction followed proce-
dures as previously reported ( 60 ). Barcoded exon capture libraries 
were pooled into batches of 96 samples for sequencing. 
 Whole-genome sequencing  Creation of adaptor-ligated barcoded 
libraries was performed as for hybrid capture, except that DNA was 
sheared to a larger fragment size (adaptor-ligated fragment; range, 
340–510 bp). To minimize molecular duplication and facilitate deep 
and diverse sequence coverage, two libraries were prepared from each 
sample. 
 Transcriptome sequencing  RNA for each sample was converted 
into a library of template molecules for sequencing according to the 
protocol for the Illumina TruSeq unstranded RNA Sample Protocol 
( 61 ). All libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instru-
ment set to generate 76-bp paired-end reads for WES and RNASeq 
and 101-bp paired-end reads for WGS. 
 Genotyping arrays  Tumor–normal matched samples were proc-
essed and hybridized to Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays for genotyping 
and copy-number analysis ( 62 ). 
 Contamination estimates  SNP ﬁ ngerprinting was used to cross-
check each sequenced lane from a tumor–normal pair against all 
other lanes from that pair and to ensure matching between WES, 
WGS, SNP array, and RNASeq. Cross-contamination was estimated 
by using ContEst ( 63 ). All samples were found to have less than 4% 
contamination. 
 Sequencing Analysis 
 DNA sequence alignment and variant detection  To prepare read 
alignments for analysis, we processed all sequence data through the 
Broad Institute’s data-processing pipeline, “Picard.” For each sample, 
this pipeline combines data from multiple libraries and ﬂ ow cell runs 
into a single BAM ﬁ le. This ﬁ le contains reads aligned to the human 
genome with quality scores recalibrated using the TableRecalibra-
tion tool from the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK; ref.  64 ). Reads 
were aligned to the Human Genome Reference Consortium build 
37 (GRCh37) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. All BAM ﬁ les were 
deposited in the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) 
upon publication. Variant detection and analysis of the BAM ﬁ les were 
performed using the Broad Institute’s Cancer Genome Analysis infra-
structure program “Firehose.” Firehose facilitates comparison of BAM 
ﬁ les from matched tumor–normal pairs and coordinates execution of 
speciﬁ c modules including quality control, local realignment, muta-
tion calling, small insertion and deletion identiﬁ cation, rearrangement

detection, variant annotation, computation of mutation rates, and 
calculation of sequencing metrics. Module versioning and logging of 
the speciﬁ c analytic parameters is also tracked. Somatic SNVs and 
indels were identiﬁ ed using MuTect (Firehose  CallSomaticMutations 
v123; ref.  65 ), and Indelocator (Firehose CallIndelsPipeline v65; ref. 
 66 ), respectively. Each mutation was annotated by Oncotator (Firehose 
OncotatorPipeline v81). We manually reviewed all somatic mutations 
and indels identiﬁ ed in the 26 tumor–normal pairs by the automated 
pipeline using the Integrated Genomic Viewer (IGV; ref.  67 ). Manual 
review removed approximately 20% of the somatic mutations from 
subsequent analysis, consistent with a very low false-positive rate (∼0.1/
Mb). Genomic rearrangements were detected from WGS and WES data 
using dRanger (Firehose dRanger v146) or manual review using IGV. 
Somatic copy-number variants were detected from SNP-array data 
using the Broad Institute’s copy-number pipeline and from WES data 
using CapSeg (Firehose CapSegModule v77), which uses read depth 
in the exome to estimate somatic copy-number changes across the 
genome. SNP-array data were analyzed using the tool  ABSOLUTE to 
infer the tumor purity and ploidy ( 49 ,  68 ). 
 Germline ﬁ ltering for tumor-only and cell line samples  We devised 
a ﬁ ltering approach to reduce the nonsomatic component of muta-
tions detected in tumor samples and cell lines without matched nor-
mal samples. The ﬁ lter removed recurring germline mutations with 
population minor allele frequencies exceeding 0.5% and removed any 
candidate mutation occurring at sites of recurring artifacts identiﬁ ed 
in more than 15% of a panel of 2,913 normal exomes. The processing 
for tumor-only and cell line data consisted of three steps.
 1.  Candidate mutation detection and raw ﬁ ltering. After aligning tumor 
and cell line data to the reference genome (GRCh37), we generated 
candidate mutation lists with MuTect (Firehose CallSomatic-
Mutations v131; ref.  65 ) and Indelocator (Firehose CallIndel-
sPipeline v77; ref.  66 ) by pairing tumor samples with a normal 
sample (SJDES001). Variants with less than 3 alternate allele 
(alt) reads were removed. Also at this step, mutations outside the 
coding regions were eliminated from consideration because non-
coding coverage is expected to vary between WES platforms ( 69 ). 
 2.  Common population variant ﬁ lter. Tumor and cell line variants were 
ﬁ ltered if the allele frequencies exceeded 0.5% in 1000 Genomes 
Project phase I data (any major population group) or in African 
American or European American populations in the ESP ( 20, 21 ). 
 3.  Panel of normals ﬁ lter ( PoN ). For remaining variants, corresponding 
loci were examined in data from 2,913 normal samples. Each site 
in each normal sample was classiﬁ ed into one of the following 
categories for each sample:
 PoN(1): total read depth at loci < 8x (i.e., insufﬁ cient coverage) 
 PoN(2): alt count ≥ 10 and alt fraction ≥ 20% 
 PoN(3): alt count ≥ 3 and alt fraction > 20% 
 PoN(4): alt count ≥ 3 and alt fraction ≥ 3% 
 PoN(5): alt count ≥ 3 and alt fraction ≥ 1% 
 PoN(6): alt count ≥ 2 and alt fraction ≥ 0.3% 
 PoN(7): alt count ≥ 1 and alt fraction ≥ 0.1% 
 PoN(8): total depth ≥ 8 and none of previous criteria. 
 The fraction of the 2,913 normal samples in each of the eight cat-
egories was calculated for each candidate mutation site. Candidate 
variants at loci that did not meet the following criteria were removed 
from subsequent analysis: 
 Fraction samples PoN(1)<0.15 & PoN(2)<0.001 & 
Sum(PoN(4:7))<0.15 & PoN(8)>0.7. 
 Although approximately 150 rare germline variants per tumor 
sample pass this ﬁ lter, we found that the nonsomatic:somatic ratio 
of mutations was reduced to approximately 12:1 with this method 
(based on the comparison of ﬁ ltering of 26 tumors with and without 
pairing of normal samples), which is sufﬁ cient for MutSig 2CV to 
identify signiﬁ cantly recurring mutations above the background 
germline mutation rate ( 19 ). Following the “panel of normal” ﬁ lter, 
SNVs were also subjected to “oxo-G” ﬁ ltering to remove C>A artifact 
from library preparation–associated oxidative damage ( 70 ). 
 Determining 
DNA 
somatic 
variant 
signiﬁ cance  GISTIC2.0 
(Firehose Gistic2_Pipeline v99) was used to identify signiﬁ cantly 
recurring SCNAs from both SNP-array and WES data ( 33 ). Identi-
ﬁ cation of gene mutations most likely to be driving tumorigenesis 
( signiﬁ cantly mutated genes) was performed by the MutSig 2CV 
algorithm ( 19 ). 
 Estimating CCF  Tumor purity and ploidy values were estimated 
using the ABSOLUTE Toolkit ( 68 ) based on SCNAs and SNV allele 
fractions. In samples without sufﬁ cient aneuploidy for ABSOLUTE 
to converge on a solution, a custom MATLAB script estimated purity 
based on evidence from allele fraction distribution of mutations that 
were consistent with clonal heterozygous somatic SNVs. The CCF of 
each mutation was then estimated by ABSOLUTE or by the custom 
MATLAB script using purity and ploidy estimates ( 49 ). 
 Transcriptome sequencing alignment and analysis  The PRADA 
pipeline was used for alignment of RNA sequenced reads (Firehose 
BWATrancriptome v32) to a reference genome consisting of GRCh37 
and the human transcriptome. Mutations detected from the WES 
and WGS were compared with RNASeq data from the same samples 
to estimate the mutation validation rate (Supplementary Fig. S2; 
Firehose CrossvalidateMutations v15; ref.  66 ). RNA fusions were 
identiﬁ ed from the PRADA pipeline (Firehose RNAFusion v19) based 
on reads containing mates mapping to two different coding regions. 
Exon-level transcript expression from RNASeq data was evaluated 
using RNA-SeQC (Firehose RNASeqMetrics v35; ref.  71 ). Reads 
were then converted to gene-level expression by determining the 
reads mapped to the genome per kilobase per million mapped reads 
(RPKM) for each gene ( 72 ). We also calculated gene-fragment RPKMs 
for the  EWS ,  FLI , and  ERG genes involved in  EWS – ETS translocations. 
RPKM calculations for prefusion exon regions and for postfusion 
exon regions were performed separately for  EWS ,  FLI , and  ERG genes 
in each tumor sample. 
 Cell Culture 
 Ewing sarcoma cell lines were provided by the laboratory of 
Dr. Todd Golub (Broad Institute) except for the EWS502 and 
EWS834 cells, both of which were a gift from Dr. Jonathan Fletcher 
(Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA) and cultured as 
previously described ( 32 ). CHLA-258 cells were grown in Iscove’s 
Modiﬁ ed  Dulbecco’s Medium (Invitrogen) with 20% heat-inactivated 
FBS (Gemini Bio-Products) and supplemented with 10 mg/L insulin, 
5.5 mg/L transferrin, and 6.7 μg/L sodium selenite (ITS; Thermo 
Fisher Scientiﬁ c IST) and 0.7 mmol/L  L -glutamine (Thermo Fisher 
Scientiﬁ c). Cell lines were authenticated with WES and RNASeq as 
described in the article .
