Somatic alterations in cellular DNA underlie almost all human
cancers1. The prospect of targeted therapies2 and the development
of high-resolution, genome-wide approaches3–8 are now spurring
systematic efforts to characterize cancer genomes. Here we report
a large-scale project to characterize copy-number alterations in
primary lung adenocarcinomas. By analysis of a large collection
of tumours (n 5 371) using dense single nucleotide polymorphism
arrays, we identify a total of 57 significantly recurrent events. We
find that 26 of 39 autosomal chromosome arms show consistent
large-scale copy-number gain or loss, of which only a handful have
been linked to a specific gene. We also identify 31 recurrent focal
events, including 24 amplifications and 7 homozygous deletions.
Only six of these focal events are currently associated with known
mutations in lung carcinomas. The most common event, amp-
lification of chromosome 14q13.3, is found in
12% of samples.
On the basis of genomic and functional analyses, we identify
NKX2-1 (NK2 homeobox 1, also called TITF1), which lies in the
minimal 14q13.3 amplification interval and encodes a lineage-
specific transcription factor, as a novel candidate proto-oncogene
involved in a significant fraction of lung adenocarcinomas. More
generally, our results indicate that many of the genes that are
involved in lung adenocarcinoma remain to be discovered.
A collection of 528 snap-frozen lung adenocarcinoma resection
specimens, with at least 70% estimated tumour content, was selected
by a panel of thoracic pathologists (Supplementary Table 1); samples
were anonymized to protect patient privacy. Tumour and normal
DNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix 250K Sty single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Genomic copy number for each of over
238,000 probe sets was determined by calculating the intensity ratio
between the tumour DNA and the average of a set of normal
DNAs9,10. Segmented copy numbers for each tumour were inferred
with the GLAD (gain and loss analysis of DNA) algorithm11 and
normalized to a median of two copies. Each copy number profile
was then subjected to quality control, resulting in 371 high-quality
samples used for further analysis, of which 242 had matched normal
samples (Methods).
To identify regions of copy-number alteration, we applied GISTIC
(genomic identification of significant targets in cancer)12, a statistical
method that calculates a score that is based on both the amplitude and
frequency of copy-number changes at each position in the genome,
using permutation testing to determine significance (Methods).
GISTIC identified 26 large-scale events and 31 focal events,
reported below. Although the overall pattern is broadly consistent
with the literature on lung cancer8,13–15, our sample size and resolu-
tion provide more power to accurately identify and localize both
large-scale and focal chromosomal alterations. With respect to
large-scale events, no single previous study has identified more than
5 of the gains or 11 of the losses13,14 (Supplementary Table 2). With
respect to focal events, three recent studies8,14,15 report a total of ,200
events, including 23 of the 31 recurrent focal events observed in our
study. The overlap among these three studies is limited to only four
events (amplification of EGFR, CCNE1, MDM2 and 8p11, all seen

here; Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Results). A gen-
ome-wide view of segmented copy number reveals that most
chromosomal arms undergo either amplification or deletion across
a large proportion of the samples (Fig. 1a). The distinctive pattern of
amplification and loss is also apparent when the median copy num-
ber for each chromosome arm is plotted (Supplementary Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Table 4). In total, GISTIC identifies 26 large segments
(at least half of a chromosome arm), 10 with significant gains and 16
with significant losses (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 5).
Visual inspection reveals that similar chromosomal patterns of
copy number loss and gain across the genome are found in almost
all samples, but that the samples show substantial differences in the
amplitude of copy-number variation (Fig. 1a). When the samples are
partitioned into tertiles on the basis of overall variation in copy-
number amplitude, each shows similar regions of amplification
and loss across the genome. The attenuation seen in many samples
is consistent with admixture with euploid non-tumour DNA, which
we estimate at 50%, 65% and 78% respectively in the three tertiles
(Supplementary Results and Supplementary Fig. 2). The significant
non-tumour admixture in these tumour samples also makes it
difficult to assess genome-wide loss of heterozygosity (LOH).
Because normal DNA admixture limits sensitivity, we report LOH
only in the top tertile; we see both LOH associated with copy-number
loss and copy-neutral LOH (chromosomes 17p and 19p) (Supple-
mentary Results, Supplementary Figs 3 and 4, and Supplementary
Table 6).

The most common genomic alteration in lung adenocarcinoma is
copy-number gain of chromosome 5p, which is found in 60% of total
samples and over 80% of the top tertile (Supplementary Table 5).
Another 15 large-scale events are seen in at least 33% of all samples
and over 40% of the top tertile. Together, the regions of common
copy-number gain (,650 megabases (Mb)) and copy-number loss
(,1,010 Mb) comprise more than half of the human genome
(Supplementary Results and Supplementary Table 5). Despite their
high frequency, few of these large-scale events have been clearly
related to functional effects on specific genes. Loss of a chromosome
arm is likely to act by uncovering an inactivated tumour suppressor
gene, yet such mutations have been well-established in lung adeno-
carcinoma in only three of the sixteen deleted chromosome arms
(CDKN2A on 9p, TP53 on 17p and STK11 on 19p)16–18. We tested
for correlations between the large-scale lesions and clinical para-
meters, but none was significant after correction for multiple hypo-
thesis testing (Supplementary Results and Supplementary Table 7).
Focal deletions may help pinpoint tumour suppressor genes, par-
ticularly on chromosome arms that show frequent copy-number loss.
At a threshold set to detect homozygous deletions in the presence of
stromal contamination, GISTIC analysis identified seven focal can-
didate regions (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 8). The most sig-
nificant focal deletions, detected in 3% of all samples and 6.5% of the
top tertile, encompass CDKN2A/CDKN2B, two well-documented
tumour suppressor genes on chromosome 9p21 (Fig. 1c, Table 1
and Supplementary Table 8). The protein products of CDKN2A
and CDKN2B inhibit two cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdk4 and
Cdk6, the genes of which both reside in frequently amplified regions
(see below). Two other deleted regions also encompass known
tumour suppressor genes, PTEN and RB1 (Supplementary Table 8).
Three additional deletion regions each localize to a single gene.
Deletions of the 59 untranslated region of PTPRD, encoding a tyr-
osine phosphatase, occur in 4% of the top tertile. Although PTPRD
deletions have been reported in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines8,19,20,
this is the first observation in primary human lung adenocarcinomas.
Homozygous deletions of PDE4D occur in 1.6% of the top tertile and
typically remove several hundred kilobases and affect multiple exons
(Supplementary Fig. 5). These deletions may be significant for lung
biology because PDE4D encodes the major phosphodiesterase
responsible for degrading cyclic AMP in airway epithelial cells21.
Another single-gene deletion occurs within AUTS2, a gene of
unknown function in chromosome 7q11.22 (Table 1 and Supple-
mentary Table 8). We cannot exclude the possibility that some recur-
rent copy-number losses are due to genomic fragility unrelated to
carcinogenesis; the presence of point mutations would provide addi-
tional support for a role in cancer.
We therefore sequenced all exons of AUTS2, PDE4D and PTPRD,
as each of these genes showed single-gene deletions but no mutations
have been reported in primary tumours. Although we did not detect
somatic mutations in AUTS2 or PDE4D, we identified validated
somatic PTPRD mutations in 11 of 188 samples sequenced.
Notably, three of the mutations encode predicted inactivating
changes in the tyrosine phosphatase domain (Supplementary Table
9 and Supplementary Fig. 6). These results implicate PTPRD as a
probable cancer-associated gene, although further studies are needed
to establish a causative role in cancer via gain or loss of function.
We focused above on homozygous deletions, but note that this
approach will miss important genes. Notably, the TP53 locus is
known to be mutated in ,50% of lung adenocarcinomas but shows
no homozygous deletions in our data.
We next focused on focal amplification events, for which it may be
easier to pinpoint target genes. At a threshold designed to identify
high-copy amplification, the GISTIC analysis identified 24 recurrent
genomic segments with maximum copy number ranging from about
4- to 16-fold (Fig. 1c, Table 1 and Supplementary Table 10). The
amplification events are seen in 1–7% of all samples (1–12% in the
top tertile). Each of these events is seen in at least two samples and all
but eight are seen in at least five samples. In the 13 most significant
amplifications (q , 0.01), the regions can be localized to relatively
small genomic segments containing 15 or fewer genes. Although 14 of
the 24 regions of recurrent amplification contain a known proto-
oncogene (Supplementary Table 10), only three of these genes
(EGFR, KRAS and ERBB2) have been previously reported to be
mutated in lung adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Results). The
remaining 11 genes are clear targets for re-sequencing in lung
tumours.

Our data localize the amplification peak on chromosome 5p to the
telomerase catalytic subunit gene, TERT. Although broad amplifica-
tion of chromosome 5p has been described in non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC)13,22,23, the target of 5p amplification has not been
determined. In our data set, eight tumours with amplicons in chro-
mosome 5p15 delineate a region containing ten genes, including
TERT (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 10), suggesting that
TERT may be the target of the amplification and thereby contributes
to cellular immortalization.
Chromosome 6p21.1 shows focal amplification in four samples in
a region containing two genes, one of which (VEGFA) encodes vas-
cular endothelial growth factor (Table 1 and Supplementary Table
10). This amplification suggests a possible mechanism for increased
angiogenesis and for the reported response to angiogenic inhibitors
such as the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab in lung adenocarci-
noma24,25. Similarly, amplification of regions including several cell
cycle genes such as CDK4, CDK6 and CCND1 suggests an important
role for these genes (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 10).
Notably, the most common focal amplification does not include
any known proto-oncogenes: chromosome 14q13.3 is amplified in
6% of the samples overall and 12% of the samples in the top tertile
(Fig. 1c, Table 1 and Supplementary Table 10; q , 10228). Although
previous studies have reported amplification of 14q13 in lung cancer
cell lines14 and the region is mentioned in studies of primary lung
tumours8,15, the target gene in this region had not been identified.
With our large sample size, we are able to narrow the critical region to
a 480-kilobase interval containing only two known genes, MBIP and
NKX2-1 (Fig. 2a, b, Table 1 and Supplementary Table 10). Data for a
single tumour with a small region of high-level amplification, com-
prising MBIP and NKX2-1, exclude the neighbouring gene, NKX2-8
(Fig. 2c).
We confirmed the amplification of the region by fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR; data not shown). FISH analysis was performed with a bac-
terial artificial chromosome (BAC) probe containing NKX2-1 and
NKX2-8 (Fig. 2c) on an independent set of 330 lung adenocarcinoma
samples from tissue microarrays. High-level amplification of the
chromosome 14q13.3 region was seen in 12% (40 out of 330) of these
lung tumours. The FISH studies revealed amplification up to an
estimated 100-fold (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 7); the lower
amplification estimated on the SNP arrays (up to 14-fold) probably
reflects signal saturation, stromal admixture and tumour heterogen-
eity. No significant difference in patient survival after surgical resec-
tion and long-term follow-up was observed between tumours with
amplified or non-amplified NKX2-1 (Supplementary Fig. 8 and
Supplementary Table 11). Exon-based sequencing in 384 lung adeno-
carcinoma DNA samples showed no somatic mutations in either
NKX2-1 or MBIP (Supplementary Results), indicating that any onco-
genic function might be exerted by the wild-type gene.
We used RNA interference (RNAi) to test the roles of both MBIP
and NKX2-1 with respect to cell survival and oncogenic properties.
Expression of two different short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting
NKX2-1 significantly reduced the levels of NKX2-1 protein in NCI-
H2009 cells (Fig. 3a) and NCI-H661 cells (data not shown)—NSCLC
lines that carry 14q amplifications14. No NKX2-1 protein was
detected in A549 cells that lack 14q amplification (Fig. 3a).
RNAi-mediated inhibition of NKX2-1 expression substantially
decreased the ability of NCI-H2009 cells to grow in an anchorage-
independent manner as measured by colony formation in soft
agar (Fig. 3b), which may be due, in part, to a loss of cell viability.
NCI-H661 cell viability was also impaired by NKX2-1 RNAi
(Supplementary Fig. 9). NKX2-1 knockdown leads to a decrease in
colony formation in lung adenocarcinoma lines (NCI-H1975 and
HCC1171) that lack chromosome 14q13 amplification but express
NKX2-1 (Supplementary Fig. 10), but has no effect on either soft agar
colony formation or cell viability in A549 cells, which express little or
no NKX2-1 protein (Fig. 3a, c). In contrast to the results for NKX2-1,
RNAi-based MBIP knockdown neither decreased colony formation
in NCI-H2009 cells (Fig. 3d, e) or in NCI-H661 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 11a, b), nor reduced cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 11c, d). It
thus seems that NKX2-1, but not MBIP, is essential for the survival
and tumorigenic properties of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines that
express NKX2-1.
Systematic understanding of the molecular basis of a particular
type of cancer will require at least three steps: comprehensive
characterization of recurrent genomic aberrations (including copy-
number changes, nucleotide sequence changes, chromosomal
rearrangements and epigenetic alterations); elucidation of their
biological role in cancer pathogenesis; and evaluation of their utility
for diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics. This study represents
a step towards comprehensive genomic characterization of one of the

most common cancers, lung adenocarcinoma. We define two main
types of recurrent events in this disease: frequent, large-scale events
and rare, focal events. Further efforts to identify the target genes of
the frequent, large-scale events will probably involve systematic
screens to produce orthogonal data sets (mutational, epigenetic,
expression and loss-of-function phenotypes).
Strikingly, the single most common focal event in lung adenocarci-
noma (amplification of 14q13.3) was not previously associated with a
specific gene. We show here that the target gene is NKX2-1, a tran-
scription factor that has an essential role in the formation of type II
pneumocytes, the cell type that lines the alveoli of the lung26,27. Nkx2-1
knockout mice fail to develop normal type II pneumocytes or alveoli
and die of respiratory insufficiency at birth28, which highlights the
importance of NKX2-1 in lung development. NKX2-1 shows hallmarks
of a novel lineage-survival oncogene, similar to the MITF gene in
melanoma7. The lineage-restricted amplification of such genes con-
trasts with the more ubiquitous amplifications seen for genes in cell
cycle (for example, CDK4, CDK6, CCND1, CCNE1) and signal trans-
duction (for example, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS) pathways.
More generally, our results, together with other recent studies29,
illustrate the power of systematic copy-number analysis with SNP
arrays. They make clear that many important cancer-related genes
remain to be discovered and can be revealed by systematic genomic
study.
METHODS SUMMARY
DNA specimens were labelled and hybridized to the Affymetrix 250K Sty I array
to obtain signal intensities and genotype calls. Loci identified by GISTIC analysis
were further characterized by sequencing, genotype validation, tissue microarray
FISH and functional studies. RNAi was performed by stable expression of shRNA
lentiviral vectors targeting NKX2-1, MBIP or GFP in lung cancer cell lines, which
were then used in soft agar and cell proliferation assays. Raw data and related files
are available at http://www.broad.mit.edu/tsp.

METHODS
Primary lung specimens. A total of 575 DNA specimens were obtained from
primary lung tumours (all of them with the original diagnosis of lung adeno-
carcinoma, 528 of which were confirmed to be lung adenocarcinomas), 439
matched normal samples and 53 additional normal specimens. These DNAs
were labelled and hybridized to SNP arrays (see below) without previous
whole-genome amplification. Each of the selected tumour samples was deter-
mined to have greater than 70% tumour percentage by pathology review.
Of the 575 selected tumours, 384 anonymous lung tumour and matched
normal DNAs for the Tumour Sequencing Project (TSP) were collected from
five sites: Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (102 tumours and paired
normal samples), University of Michigan (101 tumours and paired normal
samples), MD Anderson Cancer Center (29 tumours and paired normal sam-
ples), Washington University (84 tumours and paired normal samples) and
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/The Broad Institute (68 tumours and paired nor-
mal samples). Additional anonymous lung adenocarcinoma samples or DNAs
were collected from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital tissue bank (19
tumours and 18 paired normal samples), H. Sasaki at the Nagoya City
University Medical School (112 tumours and 37 paired normal samples) and
from the University Health Network in Toronto (60 tumour samples). In addi-
tion to the matched normal samples, 53 unmatched normal tissue or blood
samples were used for SNP array normalization purposes (sources include J.
Llovet, S. Pomeroy, S. Singer, the Genomics Collaborative, Inc., Massachusetts
General Hospital and R. Beroukhim). All tumour samples were surgically dis-
sected and frozen at 280 uC until use.
SNP array experiments. For each sample, SNPs were genotyped with the Sty I
chip of the 500K Human Mapping Array set (Affymetrix Inc.). Array experi-
ments were performed according to manufacturer’s directions. In brief, for each
sample, 250 ng of genomic DNA was digested with the StyI restriction enzyme
(New England Biolabs). The digested DNA was then ligated to an adaptor with
T4 ligase (New England Biolabs) and PCR-amplified using an Applied
Biosystems 9700 Thermal Cycler I and Titanium Taq (Clontech) to achieve a
size range of 200–1,100 bp. Amplified DNA was then pooled, concentrated and
put through a clean-up set. The product was then fragmented using DNaseI
(Affymetrix Inc.) and subsequently labelled, denatured and hybridized to arrays.
Hybridized arrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G
(Affymetrix Inc.). Batches of 96 samples were processed as a single plate using
a Biomek FX robot with dual 96 and span-8 heads (Beckman Coulter) and a
GeneChip Fluidics Station FS450 (Affymetrix Inc.). Samples and plates were
tracked using ABGene 2D barcode rack and single tube readers (ABGene).
Tumour and paired normal sample (where applicable) were always placed in
adjacent wells on the same plate to minimize experimental differences. Raw data
(.CEL and .txt files) are available at http://www.broad.mit.edu/tsp.
Primary SNP array data analysis. SNP arrays were processed as a plate of 96
samples using the GenePattern software package32, with modules based on
dChipSNP algorithms9,10. GenePattern modules are available at http://
www.broad.mit.edu/cancer/software/genepattern/. Intensity (.CEL) files were
normalized and modelled using the PM-MM difference modelling method9 with
the SNPfileCreator module. Array normalization, similar to quantile normaliza-
tion, was performed33; 6,000 matching quantiles from the probe density distri-
butions of two arrays were used to fit a running median normalization curve for
normalization of each array to a common baseline array10.
Array quality control analysis. Further analysis was performed on arrays that
met certain quality control criteria. As a first step, non-adenocarcinoma samples
(n 5 47) from the TSP set of 384 tumours were removed from further analysis
(leaving 528 adenocarcinomas). Technical failure criteria (removing 33
tumours) included a requirement for correct tumour/normal matching, geno-
typing call rates (% of SNPs that a genotype call can be inferred for) greater than
85% and a score measuring copy-number variation between neighbouring SNPs
of less than 0.5. The measure of local SNP copy number variation is calculated by
the formula: variation score 5 mean[(log(RCi) 2log(RCi11))21(log(RCi)2
log(RCi21))2], where RCi is the raw copy number at SNP i and the mean is taken
over all SNPs. Criteria also included a requirement that after taking the log2 ratio
and performing segmentation by GLAD11, the number of times the smoothed
copy number crossed 60.1 on the log scale in the genome of tumour samples
was ,100 (removing 73 tumours). The same test was used to exclude normal
samples, with the number of times the smoothed copy number crossed 60.1
decreased to,45 (removing 50 normal samples). A histogram quality control
step, as part of the GISTIC procedure, then removed tumours (n551) with high
degrees of non-tumour DNA contamination by looking for samples with only one
peak of copy number across its whole genome. This histogram quality control step
also removed normals (n520) with tumour DNA contamination by looking for
samples with greater than one peak of copy number across its whole genome.
GISTIC analysis. GISTIC analysis12 was performed on arrays that met certain
quality control criteria. Raw intensity value files from the GenePattern
SNPfileCreator module were used as input into the GISTIC algorithm. In brief,
batch correction, data normalization, copy-number determination using either
the paired normal sample or the average of the five closest normal samples and
copy number segmentation was performed. Data-set-specific copy number poly-
morphisms were identified by running GISTIC on the set of normal samples
alone; the regions identified from this analysis were then also removed from the
subsequent analysis of tumours. GISTIC then assigns GAMP and GDEL scores to
each locus, respectively representing the frequency of amplifications (deletions)
seen at that locus, multiplied by the average increase (decrease) in the log2 ratio
in the amplified (deleted) samples. The score (G) is based on the average ampli-
tude (a) of the lesion type (amplification or deletion) and its frequency (f) in the
data set according to the formula: Gi
(lesion type) 5 fi
(lesion type) ai
(lesion type). The
significance of each score is determined by comparison to similar scores obtained
after permuting the data within each sample. The resulting q-value is an upper
bound for the expected fraction of false positives among all regions with a
particular q-value or less. GISTIC also implements a peel-off step, which iden-
tifies additional secondary peaks within a region.
GISTIC analysis was performed essentially the same as is described in a future
publication12, with the following exceptions. Copy number determination was
performed for each tumour using its matched normal sample when available and
of good quality (n 5 242). For all others, the average of the five closest normal
samples was used (n 5 129). Copy number segmentation was performed using
the GLAD algorithm with parameter d 5 10. GLAD segments less than eight
SNPs in length were also removed.
Regions identified by GISTIC were also compared to known copy-number
polymorphisms34 and were manually reviewed for the presence of the alteration
in the paired normal sample. Focal deletion regions with events that occurred in
tumour samples that did not have paired normal samples were considered pre-
sumed polymorphisms and also removed from the list. Secondary peaks and
known and presumed germline copy number polymorphisms are listed in
Supplementary Tables 12 and 13.
GISTIC analysis of large-scale regions. Significant broad regions of amplifica-
tion and deletion were identified by applying GISTIC with the default thresholds
of 2.14/1.87 (log2 ratio of 60.1). Regions identified by GISTIC that were greater
than 50% of a chromosome arm were considered large-scale. Region frequencies
were calculated by determining the number of samples that had a median log2
ratio greater/less than the threshold (60.1), for those SNPs within the region.
GISTIC analysis of focal regions. Significant focal regions of amplification and
deletion were identified by applying GISTIC with a threshold of 3.6/1.2 (log2
ratio of 0.848/20.737).
Data visualization. Normalized raw copy number from GISTIC analysis was
used as input for visualization in the GenePattern SNPviewer (http://
www.broad.mit.edu/cancer/software/genepattern/)32.
Mapping
information
for SNP, Refgene and cytoband locations are based on Affymetrix annotations
and the hg17 build of the human genome sequence from the University of
California, Santa Cruz (http://genome.ucsc.edu).
Chromosome arm analysis. After segmentation by GLAD, the median of each
chromosome arm for each sample was calculated. Amplification or deletion of an
arm across the data set was tested for significance by a two-sided binomial test,
after removing log2 copy number ratios between 60.1. P values were false-
discovery rate (FDR) corrected to give a FDR q value; significance is set to a
q value of 0.01. The standard deviation of the median copy number of significant
arms was then used to sort samples into three groups. Higher standard deviation
implies higher interchromosomal variation, which correlates with less stromal
contamination. Frequencies were then calculated for the total set and for only the
top one-third least stromally contaminated samples to give a better idea of true
frequencies in the context of attenuated signal owing to stromal contamination.
Comparison between tertiles. A similar chromosome arm analysis was per-
formed independently on the three sample groups, separated according to the
standard deviations of their median arm log2 copy number ratios. Amplification
or deletion of an arm across the data set was tested for significance by a two-sided
binomial test, after removing values between 60.0125. P values were FDR cor-
rected to give a FDR q value, significance is set to a q value of 0.01.
Estimation of stromal contamination. To attempt to estimate stromal contam-
ination, we calculated the allele-specific copy numbers by taking all informative
SNPs in each of the 237 tumours that have a paired normal (removing five bad
pairs) and dividing the allele-specific signal from the tumour by that of the
normal. Then for each SNP we found M, the minimum between the copy num-
bers of the A and B alleles. In regions in which one allele has zero copies (for
example, one copy loss in diploid cells) M represents the stromal contamination
level (as the stroma has one copy of each allele). We calculated the median value

of M across each of the chromosome arms and then estimated the stromal
contamination by taking their minimum.
LOH analysis. Inferred LOH calls using an HMM algorithm for 242 tumour/
normal sample pairs were generated using dChipSNP35. Default parameters were
used, except the genotyping error rate was set to 0.2. Five bad-quality sample
pairs were removed before visualization and GISTIC analysis. GISTIC analysis of
LOH calls and copy loss for 237 samples were performed as described12.
Correlation analysis. Associations were tested between each large-scale altera-
tion identified by GISTIC and certain clinical parameters. A Fisher’s exact test
was used to determine association of large-scale copy-number lesions with the
binary clinical parameters (gender and smoking status). A chi-squared test was
used to determine whether each large-scale copy number alteration was inde-
pendent of each non-binary clinical parameter (age range, differentiation,
tumour stage or patient’s reported ancestry). P values were FDR corrected to
give a FDR q value, significance is set to a q value of 0.05.
Correlation of clinical features and NKX2-1 amplification. The analysis
included 123 consecutive patients with lung adenocarcinoma treated at
Brigham and Women’s Hospital between January 1997 and December 1999.
Fifty-two of these cases had a FISH amplification status that was not assessable
(6 cases showed no tumour on the tissue cores and 46 cases had insufficient
hybridization). Of the remaining 71 cases, 10 cases had NKX2-1 amplification, 1
had a NKX2-1 deletion, and 60 cases showed no NKX2-1 alteration. All cases for
which the NKX2-1 amplification status was not assessable and the one case that
showed a NKX2-1 deletion were excluded, bringing the final number of cases
included in the analysis to 70.
All cases were histologically confirmed as lung adenocarcinomas. For cases
that showed a pure solid growth pattern, mucicarmine and immunohistochem-
ical stains were performed to confirm that the tumour was an adenocarcinoma.
Well-differentiated tumours were defined as tumours with a purely bronchiolo-
alveolar growth pattern or mixed tumours with an acinar component with
cytologic atypia equivalent to that seen with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.
Poorly differentiated tumours were defined as tumours that showed any amount
of solid growth. All other tumours were classified as moderately differentiated.
Patient demographics, smoking status, tumour location, type of surgical resec-
tion, tumour stage (according to the 6th edition of the American Joint
Committee on Cancer system for lung carcinoma) and nodal status were
recorded.
Overall survival of patients with NKX2-1 amplification. We excluded from the
survival analysis three cases with NKX2-1 amplification and 11 cases that had no
NKX2-1 alterations. Exclusion criteria included: cancer was a recurrence;
patients received neoadjuvant treatment; patients died within the first 30 days
after surgery; and patients had another cancer diagnosed in the 5 years before the
diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Survival was plotted by Kaplan–Meier
method using the date of resection and date of death or last follow-up.
Sequencing. NKX2-1, MBIP and AUTS2 were sequenced in all 384 TSP lung
adenocarcinomas. Primers were designed in an automated fashion using
Primer 3 (ref. 36) and characterized by amplification in genomic DNA from
three Coriell cell lines. Primers that show an agarose gel band for at least two of
the three DNAs were then used for production PCR. Passing primers were
arrayed into 384-well PCR plates along with samples and PCR master mix. A
total of 5 ng of whole-genome-amplified sample DNA was PCR amplified over
35 cycles in Thermo-Hybaid units, followed by a SAP/Exo clean-up step. NKX2-
1 PCR reactions for sequencing contained an addition of 5% DMSO. The result-
ing purified template is then diluted and transferred to new plates for the
sequencing reaction. After cycling (also performed on Thermo-Hybaids), the
plates are cleaned up with an ethanol precipitation, re-hydrated and detected on
an ABI 3730xl DNA analyser (Applied Biosystems). Output from the detectors is
transferred back to the directed sequencing platform’s informatics pipeline.
SNPs and/or mutations are then identified using three mutation-detecting algo-
rithms in parallel: PolyPhred37 and PolyDHAN (D. Richter et al., manuscript in
preparation), which are bundled into the in-house software package SNP
Compare, and the commercially available Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics,
LLC.). Candidates were filtered to remove silent variants, intronic variants (with
the exception of potential splice site mutations) and validated SNPs registered in
dbSNP or confirmed as SNPs in our previous experiments.
Mutation validation by genotyping. Homogeneous mass extension (hME) gen-
otyping for validation of sequencing candidates was performed in 96-well plates
with up to 7-plex reactions. PCR was performed with final concentrations of
0.83 mM dNTPs, 1.563 of 103 buffer, 3.38 mM MgCl, 0.03 U ml21 HotStar Taq
(Qiagen), 0.10 mM PCR primers. Thermocycling was performed at 92 uC for
15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 92 uC for 20 s, 56 uC for 30 s and 72 uC for
1 min, with an additional extension at 72 uC for 3 min. Shrimp alkaline phos-
phatase (SAP) clean-up was performed using a master mix made up of 0.53
buffer and SAP. Reactions were performed at 34 uC for 20 min, 85 uC for 5 min
and then held at 4 uC. After the SAP clean-up, hME reaction was performed using
thermosequenase and final concentrations of 0.06 mM sequenom termination
mix (specific to the pool being used), and 0.64 mM extension primer. Reactions
were cycled at 94 uC for 2 min, followed by 55 cycles of 94 uC for 5 s, 52 uC for 5 s
and 72 uC for 5 s. Samples were then put through a resin clean-up step, then the
purified primer extension reaction was loaded onto a matrix pad (3-hydroxypi-
coloinic acid) of a SpectroCHIP (Sequenom) and detected by a Bruker Biflex III
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (SpectroREADER, Sequenom).
PTPRD mutation discovery and validation. The PTPRD gene was sequenced in
188 lung adenocarcinoma samples. Sequence traces (reads) were aligned to
human reference sequence using cross-match. PolyPhred37 and PolyScan were
used to predict SNPs and insertions/deletions. Identified SNPs were validated
using the Illumina Goldengate assay. ENST00000356435 is the transcript used
for annotating the mutations. Both synonymous and non-synonymous candi-
dates were identified, but only non-synonymous mutations were validated.
Tissue microarray FISH (TMA–FISH). A Biotin-14-dCTP-labelled BAC clone
RP11-1083E2 (conjugated to produce a red signal) was used for the NKX2-1
probe and a Digoxin-dUTP labelled BAC clone RP11-72J8 (conjugated to pro-
duce a green signal) was used for the reference probe. Tissue hybridization,
washing and colour detection were performed as described previously7,38.
NKX2-1 amplification by FISH was assessed using a total of 935 samples (repre-
sented by 2,818 tissue microarray cores).
The BAC clones were obtained from the BACPAC Resource Center,
Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI, Oakland, California,
USA). Before tissue analysis, the integrity and purity of all probes were verified by
hybridization to metaphase spreads of normal peripheral lymphocytes. The
samples were analysed under a 360 oil immersion objective using an
Olympus BX-51 fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters, a
CCD (charge-coupled device) camera and the CytoVision FISH imaging and
capturing software (Applied Imaging). Semi-quantitative evaluation of the tests
was independently performed by two evaluators (S.P. and L.A.J.); at least 100
nuclei for each case were analysed when possible. Cases with significant differ-
ences between the two independent evaluations were refereed by a third person
(M.A.R.). The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 for Windows
(SPSS Inc.) with a significance level of 0.05.
Cell lines and cell culture conditions. NCI-H2009 (ref. 39), NCI-H661 (ref. 40),
NCI-H1975 (ref. 39) and HCC1171 (ref. 8) have been previously described.
A549 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. NSCLC
cells were maintained in RPMI growth media consisting of RPMI 1640 plus
2 mM L-glutamine (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Gemini Bio-Products), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin
(Mediatech).
RNAi knockdown. shRNA vectors targeted against NKX2-1, MBIP and GFP
were provided by TRC (The RNAi Consortium). The sequences targeted by
the NKX2-1 shRNAs are as follows: shNKX2-1a (TRCN0000020449), 59-
CGCTTGTAAATACCAGGATTT-39, and shNKX2-1b (TRCN0000020453),
59-TCCGTTCTCAGTGTCTGACAT-39. The sequences targeted by the MBIP
shRNA
and
GFP
shRNA
are
59-CCACCGGAAGGAAGATTTATT-39
(TRCN0000003069) and 59-GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCAT-39, respect-
ively. Lentiviruses were made by transfection of 293T packaging cells with a three
plasmid system41,42. Target cells were incubated with lentiviruses for 4.5 h in the
presence of 8 mg ml21 polybrene. After the incubation, the lentiviruses were
removed and cells were fed fresh medium. Two days after infection, puromycin
(0.75 mg ml21 for NCI-H1975, 1.0 mg ml21 for NCI-H661, 1.5 mg ml21 for NCI-
H2009, 1.0 mg ml21 for NCI-H661 and 2.0 mg ml21 for A549 and HCC1171) was
added. Cells were grown in the presence of puromycin for 3 days or until all of the
non-infected cells died. Twenty-five micrograms of total cell lysates prepared
from the puro-selected cell lines was analysed by western blotting using anti-
NKX2-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MBIP polyclonal
antibody (Proteintech Group, Inc.) and anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody
(Sigma).
Soft agar anchorage-independent growth assay. NCI-H2009 (1 3 104), NCI-
H661 (2.5 3 104), A549 (3.3 3 103), NCI-H1975 (5 3 104) or HCC1171
(1 3 104) cells expressing shRNAs targeting NKX2-1, MBIP or GFP were sus-
pended in a top layer of RPMI growth media and 0.4% Noble agar (Invitrogen)
and plated on a bottom layer of growth media and 0.5% Noble agar in 35-mm
wells. Soft agar colonies were counted 3–4 weeks after plating. The data are
derived from two independent experiments unless otherwise noted and are
graphed as the percentage of colonies formed relative to the shGFP control cells
(set to 100%) 61 standard deviation of the triplicate samples. P values between
shGFP and shNKX2-1 or shMBIP samples were calculated using a t-test.
Cell proliferation assays. NCI-H2009 (500 cells per well), A549 (400 cells per
well) and NCI-H661 (600 cells per well) cells expressing shRNAs targeting
NKX2-1, MBIP or GFP were seeded in 6 wells in a 96-well plate. Cell viability

was determined at 24-h time points for a total of 4 days using the WST-1-based
colorimetric assay (Roche Applied Science). The percentage of cell viability is
plotted for each cell line 61 standard deviation of the reading from six wells,
relative to day 0 readings. Experiments were performed two or more times and a
representative experiment is shown.
