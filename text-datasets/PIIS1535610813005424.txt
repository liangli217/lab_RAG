SUMMARY
We performed massively parallel sequencing of paired tumor/normal samples from 203 multiple myeloma
(MM) patients and identiﬁed signiﬁcantly mutated genes and copy number alterations and discovered puta-
tive tumor suppressor genes by determining homozygous deletions and loss of heterozygosity. We observed
frequent mutations in KRAS (particularly in previously treated patients), NRAS, BRAF, FAM46C, TP53, and
DIS3 (particularly in nonhyperdiploid MM). Mutations were often present in subclonal populations, and mul-
tiple mutations within the same pathway (e.g., KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF) were observed in the same patient.
In vitro modeling predicts only partial treatment efﬁcacy of targeting subclonal mutations, and even growth
promotion of nonmutated subclones in some cases. These results emphasize the importance of heterogene-
ity analysis for treatment decisions.
INTRODUCTION
We previously reported the sequencing of 38 matched tumor/
normal multiple myeloma (MM) pairs, and that report of the
genomic landscape of MM pointed to a number of recurrently
mutated genes (e.g., FAM46C and DIS3) that are likely causal
drivers of the disease (Chapman et al., 2011). However, that
study design was only powered to detect commonly mutated
genes, not less commonly mutated genes, due to the weak sta-
tistical power provided by the small sample size. It also did not
examine copy number alterations, leading to homozygous dele-
tions or loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or clonal heterogeneity due
to the modest sequence coverage (303) of those whole
genome sequences.
The identiﬁcation of driver mutations in MM holds great prom-
ise for personalized medicine, whereby patients with particular
mutations would be treated with the appropriate targeted ther-
apy (Fonseca et al., 2009; Mahindra et al., 2012; Palumbo and
Anderson, 2011). However, if the mutation is present in only a
fraction of the cells, one might doubt whether such targeted
Signiﬁcance
A vision for precision cancer medicine calls for the deployment of molecularly targeted therapeutics in genetically deﬁned
patient populations. A ﬁrst step in that process involves a description of the genetic landscape of cancer. We describe here a
more comprehensive characterization of the MM genome, identifying recurrently mutated genes, copy number alterations,
and signaling pathways. We ﬁnd evidence for extensive clonal heterogeneity in the disease, a ﬁnding that may complicate
the interpretation of genome-inspired clinical trials for MM. More generally, our ﬁndings indicate a need for the delineation of
clonal heterogeneity in genome-based diagnostic approaches to cancer.

therapy would be clinically efﬁcacious. Recent studies have
documented the existence of clonal heterogeneity in solid
tumors and acute myeloid leukemia, albeit in small numbers of
patients (Campbell et al., 2010; Carter et al., 2012; Ding et al.,
2012; Gerlinger et al., 2012; Nik-Zainal et al., 2012; Shah et al.,
2012; Walter et al., 2012). These studies demonstrated how
acquisition of genetic alterations over time leads to clonal evolu-
tion. Systemic treatment with chemotherapy may affect the
ﬁtness of some subclones more than others, and thus may alter
the tumor composition by promoting particular subclones
(Landau et al., 2013b). Consequently, the full breadth of tumor
heterogeneity, particularly in solid malignancies, may not be
captured in a single biopsy, which represents a challenge for
cancer therapy (Gerlinger et al., 2012). Clonal heterogeneity
and clonal evolution have also been observed in MM by either
whole-exome sequencing or array comparative genomic hybrid-
ization (CGH), albeit in a modest number of patients (Egan et al.,
2012; Keats et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2012).
We therefore sought to estimate the extent of clonal heteroge-
neity in MM in a large-scale MM genome sequencing data set
capturing a breadth of untreated and previously treated patients
and to infer the timing of genetic events in MM. In the work pre-
sented here, we address several important questions: (1) can we
identify signiﬁcantly mutated genes by integrating evidence from
both point mutations and copy number analysis, (2) how do the
mutation proﬁle and the clonal and subclonal composition of
MM differ between hyperdiploid and nonhyperdiploid and
between treated and untreated MM, and (3) can the contribution
of subclones in a patient be reconstructed from a single biopsy to
inform targeted therapy?
RESULTS
We ﬁrst set out to create a MM genome data set that would be
sufﬁciently powered to comprehensively assess the genetic
diversity of the disease and the extent to which subclonal hetero-
geneity is observed within patients. Approval for this study was
obtained as outlined in the Experimental Procedures, and a total
of 203 tumor-normal pairs were analyzed: 177 by whole-exome
sequencing and 26 by whole-genome sequencing (16 and 23,
respectively, have been previously reported [Chapman et al.,
2011]). The average depth of coverage for the whole exomes
and whole genomes was 893 and 303, respectively. To esti-
mate the statistical signiﬁcance of mutation frequency (as a mea-
sure of positive selection), we used a new version of the MutSig
algorithm (MutSigCV) that compares observed mutation fre-
quencies against sequence context-speciﬁc, tumor-speciﬁc,
and gene-speciﬁc background mutation frequencies (Lawrence
et al., 2013). Additionally, we developed analytical tools to
further prioritize homozygous somatic single-nucleotide variants
(SSNVs), or genes which harbor mutations that are positionally
clustered or preferentially affecting highly conserved amino
acids (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures available
online). Analysis of the 203 tumor-normal pairs showed that 11
genes were recurrently mutated using a standard signiﬁcance
threshold of q < 0.1 (Figures 1 and S1). The individual and
combined p and q values for these prioritization procedures
are shown in Tables S1 and S2. Mutation validation studies
were performed on 140 mutations, with a validation rate of
90.4%, in line with other large-scale cancer genome sequencing
studies (Table S2).
Among the 11 signiﬁcantly mutated genes were ﬁve genes
(KRAS, NRAS, FAM46C, DIS3, and TP53) previously identiﬁed
as the most commonly mutated genes in our 38-patient pilot
MM genome study (Chapman et al., 2011). An additional four
genes (BRAF, TRAF3, CYLD, and RB1) have been implicated
in the pathogenesis of MM (Annunziata et al., 2007; Chapman
et al., 2011; Demchenko et al., 2010; Keats et al., 2007; Walker
et al., 2012). PRDM1 is a transcriptional repressor that is involved
in plasmacytic differentiation, and it acts as a tumor suppressor
gene in activated B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphoma
(DLBCL). Mutations that disrupt its function have been described
in DLBCL (Mandelbaum et al., 2010), but are not known to play a
role in MM. PRDM1 has been shown to promote survival of trans-
formed plasma cells (Lin et al., 2007), and transgenic mice prone
to plasmacytoma development show reduced plasmacytoma
incidence if one or two PRDM1 alleles are knocked out (D’Costa
et al., 2009). We ﬁnd a recurrent missense mutation (S552C) in
two patients, with two additional patients harboring closely clus-
tered missense mutations (S605R and S606I), and an additional
ﬁve patients with truncating frame shift or splice site mutations,
supporting a role of PRDM1 as a tumor suppressor (Figures 1
and S1; Tables S1 and S2).
Additionally, several recurrently mutated and biologically rele-
vant genes fall just below the signiﬁcance threshold (Table S1).
For example, EGR1 was previously shown to abrogate JUN-
induced MM growth inhibition and cell death when knocked
down in MM cells and has been reported as a mechanism of
resistance to MM therapy (Chen et al., 2010). We found that
EGR1 mutations were clustered toward the 50 end of the gene
(Tables S1 and S2; Figure S1), a pattern of mutation often asso-
ciated with somatic hypermutation (Pasqualucci et al., 2001). To
further explore this possibility, we asked whether the observed
mutations occurred within WRCY motifs known to be the targets
of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a key enzyme
that catalyzes somatic hypermutation. This analysis revealed
that EGR1 indeed had signiﬁcant enrichment of mutations in
WRCY motifs (q < 0.1; Table S3), consistent with a somatic
hypermutation mechanism. Whether these mutations act as
‘‘drivers’’ and are positively selected or merely constitute ‘‘pas-
sengers’’ remains to be seen.
We also found four missense mutations in the interferon regu-
latory factor IRF4, with three of the mutations being identical
(K123R) (Chapman et al., 2011), establishing K123R as a recur-
rent, ‘‘hot spot’’ mutation in IRF4 (Figure S1; Table S2). IRF4
has previously been reported as a MM survival factor, wherein
a loss-of-function RNAi screen showed that IRF4 inhibition
results in loss of viability of MM cell lines (Shaffer et al., 2008).
SP140 is the lymphoid-restricted homolog of SP100, expressed
in plasma cells, and a genome-wide association study identiﬁed
SP140 as a susceptibility locus for chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(Di Bernardo et al., 2008), with risk alleles being associated with
reduced levels of SP140 mRNA. We identiﬁed missense,
nonsense, frame shift, and splice site alterations in eight pa-
tients, with LOH observed for two of these alterations, consistent
with its possible role as a tumor suppressor in MM.
The available clinical characteristics of the patients in the
study are shown in Figure 2 and Table S4. Identiﬁcation of

signiﬁcantly mutated genes exclusively in patients with t(4;14)
and t(11;14), as obtained for 50 patients subjected to routine clin-
ical ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing, did not
reveal additional signiﬁcantly mutated genes (Table S1). In
general, there was no strong statistically signiﬁcant association
between particular mutations and clinical features, tumor
ploidy, or history of prior treatment, but hypothesis-generating
trends could be observed (Figure 2; Tables S1 and S5). The
sample size might need to be larger to deﬁnitively address
such associations.
Tumor suppressor genes can be inactivated not only by point
mutation, but also by biallelic deletion. We therefore searched for
genes with a statistically signiﬁcant excess of homozygous dele-
tion (using a modiﬁcation of the GISTIC algorithm [Beroukhim
et al., 2007; Mermel et al., 2011]) across the 153 patients in our
study for whom high-density copy number array data were avail-
able. Deletions were identiﬁed as being homozygous using the
ABSOLUTE algorithm (Carter et al., 2012). We identiﬁed seven
signiﬁcant regions, containing 32 genes, including known tumor
suppressor genes such as CDKN2C, as well as genes associ-
ated with the regulation of the NF-kB signaling pathway,
including TRAF3, BIRC2, BIRC3, and CYLD (Figure 2; Table
S6). CYLD was also found to be signiﬁcantly mutated in ﬁve
patients (Figures 1 and 2), and its inactivation through deletions
and mutations has been described in MM (Demchenko et al.,
2010; Keats et al., 2007). Similarly, the exonuclease-encoding
DIS3 gene is subject to point mutations with LOH (as determined
by ABSOLUTE [Carter et al., 2012]), strongly implicating DIS3 as
a tumor suppressor in 11% of MM patients (Figure 2). In order to
designate samples as either hyperdiploid or nonhyperdiploid
with high resolution, we developed and validated a classiﬁcation
method using WES and WGS (Figure S2A; Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures). Interestingly, DIS3 aberration was more
commonly seen among the 86 nonhyperdiploid MM cases
compared to the 116 hyperdiploid cases (Fisher’s exact test,
p = 0.00013; Table S5), with a nonsigniﬁcant trend toward a
greater fraction of LOH in DIS3-mutated nonhyperdiploid
patients compared to hyperdiploid samples (Fisher’s exact
test, p = 0.13). We also found an excess of homozygous dele-
tions in the gene encoding the tyrosine phosphatase PTPRD,
which has recently been implicated as a tumor suppressor in
MM, glioblastoma, and other cancers (Kamada et al., 2012).
PTPRD dephosphorylates STAT3, which promotes signaling
from
interleukin-6,
a well-recognized
MM
survival
factor.
Whether interleukin-6 signaling is indeed the mechanistic target
of PTPRD deletion remains to be established. We also found
homozygous deletions with a peak at 8p23.1 (with 18 genes)
containing several candidate tumor suppressor genes (BLK,
MSRA, PINX1, and SOX7) for which a connection to MM has
not been previously established.
We next asked whether there was evidence to support
pathway-level patterns of mutation, whereby mutations in indi-
vidual genes may lack statistical signiﬁcance but when multiple
members of a pathway or functionally related gene set are

Proﬁle in Subtypes of MM
Data for all 203 patient samples for which whole-genome or
whole-exome sequencing was performed are displayed in
columns. The ﬁrst panel from the top displays patient charac-
teristics (‘‘NA,’’ if information on a characteristic was unavai-
lable). Classiﬁcation into hyperdiploid versus nonhyperdiploid
samples was performed as described in the Experimental
Procedures. The second panel displays the 11 signiﬁcantly
mutated genes and IRF4 (which harbors K123R mutations in
three patients), color-coded by the cancer cell fraction in which
these mutations occur; circles within symbols represent LOH. p
value HD and p value Tx represent differences in the prevalence
of mutations in the indicated gene between hyperdiploid and
nonhyperdiploid and between previously treated and untreated
samples, respectively. The third panel highlights samples
harboring homozygous deletions at the most-signiﬁcant loci.
Only selected genes within those loci are displayed. Gray
symbols denote samples with unavailable high-density copy
number array or ABSOLUTE data. The lower two panels display
focal deletions and ampliﬁcations in the q value peaks across
153 patients with high-density copy number arrays, as deter-
mined by GISTIC analysis. Gray symbols denote samples
without high-density copy number array. See also Figure S2 and

mutated (albeit rarely), signiﬁcance is observed. We ﬁrst tested
the three gene set hypotheses that emerged from a pilot analysis
of the MM genome, namely the NF-kB pathway, histone-modi-
fying enzymes, and the coagulation cascade (Chapman et al.,
2011). Indeed, we ﬁnd that all three gene sets retain statistical
signiﬁcance across our collection of 203 patients (p < 0.05), if
tested as individual hypotheses (Table S7). Next, we tested a
collection of 612 curated gene sets (taken from MSigDB [Subra-
manian et al., 2005]) and found that six gene sets reached statis-
tical signiﬁcance after correction for multiple-hypothesis testing
(Table S7). These gene sets primarily include mutated compo-
nents of the cell-cycle machinery (including CDKN1B and
CCND1) and serve to highlight genes that are only borderline sig-
niﬁcant when analyzed individually, but reach signiﬁcance as
part of these gene sets. For example, we observed three coding
mutations (accompanied by LOH) in the transcription factor
MAX, as part of a signiﬁcantly mutated gene set, which functions
as a heterodimerization partner for MYC, which is well known to

(A) The numbers of predicted subclones by clustering of cancer cell fractions are shown, as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. As a
comparison, the predicted distribution of the number of subclones is also shown for a cohort of patients with ovarian cancer. Error bars represent the SD.
(B) The CCF, i.e., the expected fraction of MM cells that harbor a coding mutation in the indicated gene, is shown. Each symbol represents a somatic mutation in
an individual patient. The most signiﬁcantly mutated genes are shown. On the basis of the probability distribution, mutations were determined to be either clonal
(red circles, upper bound of CCF conﬁdence interval R0.95) or subclonal (blue circles, upper bound of CCF conﬁdence interval <0.95). Error bars represent the
95% conﬁdence interval.
(C) Co-occurrence of signiﬁcant mutations in the same patient is depicted. Results of the Bayesian clustering procedure were applied to SSNV CCF distributions
for KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF in samples that harbor mutations in at least two of these three oncogenes. Probability distributions over CCF for the co-occurring
SSNV in the indicated oncogenes before clustering (black curves) and after clustering (ﬁlled red bars) are shown.
(D) The fraction of somatic mutations that are present at the indicated CCF are shown for the 11 most signiﬁcantly mutated genes. Mutations in signiﬁcantly
mutated genes occur at signiﬁcantly higher CCFs in previously treated patients compared to untreated patients (p = 0.007, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).

be dysregulated in MM (Shou et al., 2000). Interestingly, MAX has
been implicated as a tumor suppressor susceptibility gene in
pheochromocytoma (Comino-Me´ ndez et al., 2011), and a
small-molecule inhibitor of MYC-MAX heterodimerization has
been reported to result in myeloma cell death (Holien et al.,
2012).
Of the 203 patients in the study, 131 (65%) had evidence of
mutations in one or more of the 11 recurrently mutated genes,
and 103 (51%) had mutations of a gene within a statistically sig-
niﬁcant gene set (new and previously published in Table S8,
excluding signiﬁcantly mutated genes), accounting for a total
of 166 patients (82%). Of the remaining 18% of tumors lacking
such obviously functionally important mutations, some are likely
to be driven by rare mutations in bona ﬁde driver genes (e.g., the
tumors with mutations in MYD88 or CARD11, previously re-
ported to be recurrently mutated in the B cell malignancy DLBCL
[Lohr et al., 2012; Morin et al., 2011]; Tables S1 and S2). Tumors
lacking such mutations might alternatively be driven by focal
copy number alterations or chromosomal rearrangements. Of
the 153 patients from whom copy number array data were avail-
able, 119 patients (including 40 of the 60 patients lacking SSNV
in the most signiﬁcantly mutated genes) had evidence of at least
one focal gene copy number gain or loss within a signiﬁcant peak
(Figures 2 and S2B; Table S8). Twenty-one patients (of 139 pa-
tients with high-density copy number array and ABSOLUTE
data) harbored homozygous deletions in signiﬁcant peaks (Fig-
ure 2). Similarly, structural variants were found in all of the 26 pa-
tients from whom whole-genome sequencing was available
(Chapman et al., 2011), including three previously unpublished
patients (Table S9). Whether such gene rearrangements are
indeed causal of MM in these patients remains to be proven.
We next addressed the extent to which clonal heterogeneity
exists in MM. To do this, we computed the allelic fraction of
each SSNV. The allelic fraction estimation alone (Figure 1),
however, cannot be used to assess the fraction of cancer cells
harboring the mutation because it does not take into account
(1) the copy number at that locus or (2) tumor purity (whereby
normal cell contamination can lead to the spurious impression
of mutation subclonality). We therefore used the ABSOLUTE
algorithm (Carter et al., 2012) to estimate the cancer cell frac-
tion (CCF) of each SSNV by modeling the observed wild-type
and mutated allele counts, taking into account local somatic
copy number and sample purity, calculated from high-density
SNP array or sequencing data (Figure S3) (Landau et al.,
2013a). The CCF estimates for all SSNVs in a given sample
were then analyzed with a Bayesian clustering algorithm
(Landau et al., 2013b) to estimate the number of subclonal
cell populations present in each tumor (Figure S3; Experimental
Procedures).
Looking across the entire coding region, we found that sam-
ples with a purity greater than 0.7, nearly all had evidence of
clonal heterogeneity (Figure 3A). Most patients harbored at least
three detectable subclones (beyond the major clone), with some
patients having as many as seven. For comparison, the same
analysis applied to ovarian cancer (Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network, 2011) (sequenced to similar depth and with
similar purities) showed that a lower proportion of MM patients
(8%) had one or no subclones compared to ovarian cancer
(19%; Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.0047; Figure 3A).
We next asked whether certain types of mutations tend to be
clonal (consistent with early events) whereas others might tend
to be subclonal (consistent with later events). It was conceivable
that true driver mutations (e.g., those reaching statistical signiﬁ-
cance based on mutation frequency or those with strong con-
nections to MM biology) might be exclusively clonal events.
This, however, was not the case. Mutations in most of these
genes were found to be clonal in some patients and subclonal
in others, including some cases with subclonal coding mutations
occurring on segments with subclonal copy number change
(Figure 3B; Table S2). For example, of the 44 coding KRAS
mutations that were analyzed for clonality, 32 (73%) were clonal,
whereas for 12 (27%) were subclonal, detectable in as few as
13% of cells in some patients.
In some cases, we observed multiple signiﬁcant mutations in
the same tumor sample, including mutations in oncogenes
whose function might be expected to be redundant. For
example, some patients had mutations in two of three onco-
genes (NRAS, BRAF, and KRAS) (Figure 3C), or two mutations
in KRAS (Table S2), despite the fact that these mutations simi-
larly activate the MAP kinase pathway and therefore seemed
unlikely to occur in the same tumor. We therefore asked whether
there was evidence to support these mutations being present in
the same clones, or rather in different subclones within the tu-
mor. We reasoned that if they occurred in the same cell, we
should ﬁnd some cases in which both mutations were clonal.
This analysis indicated that, consistent with their biological func-
tion, KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations were rarely simulta-
neously clonal in our patient samples (one sample); instead,
they were mostly either both subclonal within the tumor or they
occurred in a nested fashion (i.e., one clone being the subclone
of another; nine samples). While these data indicate that muta-
tions in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF can coexist in the same cell,
such subclones often did not appear to have sufﬁcient selective
advantage to grow to clonality. In contrast, we found that DIS3
and KRAS mutations were often simultaneously clonal (Table
S2). DIS3 is known to encode a ribonuclease involved in RNA
processing, but how loss-of-function DIS3 mutations are onco-
genic and how they interact with KRAS in cellular transformation
remain to be determined. Interestingly, we found that in general,
signiﬁcantly recurrent mutations were more often clonal in previ-
ously treated compared to untreated patients and occurred at
higher CCFs (p = 0.007, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Figure 3D).
This suggests that treatment might accelerate the ﬁxation of
certain subclones by eliminating less ﬁt clones.
We next explored the therapeutic implications of the observed
clonal
heterogeneity.
Speciﬁcally,
we
focused
on
BRAF,
because the observation of BRAF activating mutations in MM
has stimulated clinical exploration of BRAF inhibitors in this
disease. Indeed, a recent report of a single BRAF-mutant MM
patient showing durable response to a BRAF inhibitor is encour-
aging (Andrulis et al., 2013). Consistent with that clinical
response, we found that U266 cells, which express the BRAF-
K601N mutant (COSMIC database, http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/
cancergenome/projects/cosmic/) that has been shown to cause
elevated phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK levels in other malig-
nancies (Dahlman et al., 2012), were more sensitive to treatment
with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 compared to BRAF-wild-type
cell lines (Figure 4A and 4B). In addition, BRAF inhibition

downregulated MAP kinase pathway activity only in BRAF-
mutant MM cells, whereas in BRAF-wild-type cells, the pathway
was paradoxically upregulated (Figure 4A), similar to reports in
melanoma (Poulikakos et al., 2010). Strikingly, paradoxical
pathway activation was even more pronounced in the presence
of KRAS or NRAS mutations, and this increased MAP kinase ac-
tivity was associated with BRAF-inhibitor-induced growth stimu-
lation of KRAS- or NRAS-mutant MM cell lines (Figure 4B). Taken
together, these results suggest that treatment of patients
harboring subclonal BRAF mutations may at best have only par-
tial responses when treated with BRAF inhibitors.
The presence of MAP kinase pathway activation in MM has
similarly increased interest in the clinical testing of MEK inhibi-
tors in MM (Annunziata et al., 2011; Tai et al., 2007). In mela-
noma, the combination of MEK and BRAF inhibitors appears
to be efﬁcacious with a favorable toxicity proﬁle, and the

combination appears to abrogate the paradoxical activation of
the MAP kinase pathway in BRAF-wild-type cells (Flaherty
et al., 2012). In MM cell lines, we found that combination
treatment resulted in increased killing of BRAF-mutant cells,
whereas a combination beneﬁt was not observed in BRAF-
wild-type cell lines (Figure 4C). These results support the clinical
exploration of combination BRAF/MEK inhibitors in clonal,
BRAF-mutant MM.
DISCUSSION
The modern oncology paradigm holds that the characterization
of tumor genomes will reveal a coherent view of the pathogen-
esis of cancer and that this in turn will lead to the development
of targeted therapies. Our characterization of 203 MM genomes
represents by far the most comprehensive effort reported to
date, elucidating with statistical conﬁdence the recurrent point
mutations and copy number alterations associated with the dis-
ease. In particular, the integration of copy number and mutation
analysis led to the identiﬁcation of genes whose recurrent muta-
tion is also accompanied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH), a hall-
mark of loss-of-function of tumor suppressor genes. On the
basis of these methods, biologically important driver genes
may be prioritized, even though they occur at a low frequency.
Also of interest were mutations in EGR1 (seen in seven of 203
patients). The 50 bias of the mutations and their occurring within
a WRCY motif all suggest that they occur as a result of somatic
hypermutation as a consequence of AID activity that is most
commonly associated with the normal process of immunoglob-
ulin gene rearrangement in B cells (Lenz and Staudt, 2010). We
recently reported in the B cell malignancy DLBCL that somatic
hypermutation of the BCL2 gene occurred as a result of chromo-
somal translocations that bring the immunoglobulin heavy chain
enhancer in proximity to the BCL2 locus (Lohr et al., 2012). Simi-
larly, somatic hypermutation may occur when genes are dysre-
gulated by IGH translocations in MM. For example, we identiﬁed
39 coding and noncoding mutations in the CCND1 locus, with
some samples harboring multiple mutations. In at least four
of these patients, t(11;14) translocations were also detected,
suggesting the possibility that these mutations might also result
from somatic hypermutation.
Interestingly, several genes, while not reaching statistical sig-
niﬁcance on their own, were part of frequently mutated pathways
or processes that have been causally implicated in MM
(including the NF-kB pathway, chromatin-modifying enzymes,
and RNA-processing molecules). Mutations in the RNA-binding
proteins DIS3 and FAM46C were collectively observed in 21%
of patients. It remains unknown why these mutations occur at
such high frequency in MM and yet are seen only rarely, if
ever, in other types of cancer. DIS3 mutations were often accom-
panied by LOH and were most commonly seen in nonhyperdi-
ploid MM.
Additionally, we observed an accumulation of mutations in
components of the cell-cycle machinery, as well as in members
of the MAPK pathway. A key opportunity for the future will be to
relate these mutations to the promising preclinical and clinical
results that have recently been reported in MM using cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitors and RAF kinase inhibitors (Andrulis
et al., 2013; Cirstea et al., 2013).
Perhaps the most striking ﬁnding of our study was that MM
tumors are highly heterogenous. Lower-resolution genetic ana-
lyses (e.g., cytogenetics, FISH, and array CGH) have pointed
to the existence of clonal heterogeneity in MM, and recent
studies using exome sequencing and copy number analyses in
a small number of samples similarly documented clonal diversity
(Egan et al., 2012; Keats et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2012). The
present study of 203 patients is unprecedented in its compre-
hensiveness, and the analytical approach allowed us to (1) iden-
tify subclonal mutations, (2) estimate the cancer cell fraction in
which these mutations occur, and (3) estimate the minimum
number of subclones. Our method is statistically powered to
detect subclones representing at least 10% of the overall tumor
sample. It is therefore likely that our ﬁnding that MM tumor sam-
ples contain on average at least ﬁve subclones underestimates
the clonal diversity of the disease. It is conceivable that a
much larger number of additional subclones may also exist,
either below our detection sensitivity or in nonsampled MM tis-
sues. More comprehensive characterization of MM tissue will
likely be required to resolve these questions.
Interestingly, point mutations in the most signiﬁcantly mutated
genes were found to be clonal in some patients but subclonal in
others. That is, these mutated genes appear to be able to func-
tion both as initiators of MM and also as potentiators of the
disease. For example, BRAF mutations were often subclonal
and, in some cases, coexistent with NRAS or KRAS mutations.
In our cohort, these mutations did not co-occur clonally. Rather,
at least one of them was always subclonal. With increasing
numbers of samples and greater depth of sequencing, many
more such cases, including many different genes, may be iden-
tiﬁed. Other examples of such evolution in cancer have been
reported (Campbell et al., 2010; Ding et al., 2012; Gerlinger
et al., 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2010; Nik-Zainal et al., 2012;
Shah et al., 2012; Walter et al., 2012; Wilmott et al., 2012).
These results also have important clinical implications for MM
clinical trials. For example, BRAF inhibitors are being explored in
MM harboring a BRAF mutation, and the ﬁrst patient with BRAF
V600E-positive MM who experienced a durable response to
BRAF inhibition has just been reported (Andrulis et al., 2013).
However, if a BRAF mutation is not clonal, suboptimal clinical
beneﬁt would be expected. In principle, treating patients
harboring subclonal BRAF mutations with BRAF inhibitors may
stimulate the growth of BRAF-wild-type tumor cells. Combined
BRAF and MEK inhibition might mitigate this effect, but this re-
mains to be demonstrated in vivo.
The clonal heterogeneity observed in this study offers a gener-
ally sobering view of prospects for predicting the effects of tar-
geted therapy for cancer in general. Therapy targeting a mutation
present in only a fraction of tumor cells would be expected to
affect only that subclone, leading to limited clinical beneﬁt. At
worst, targeted therapy might have a paradoxically stimulatory
effect on the subclones lacking the relevant mutation. At a min-
imum, we suggest that it will not be sufﬁcient to simply document
the presence or absence of mutations in the diagnostic setting.
Rather, it will be important to enumerate the extent of clonal het-
erogeneity in patients being evaluated for targeted therapy and
to interpret the results of subsequent therapy in light of such
genetic heterogeneity. Effective targeted therapy will require
either drug combinations targeting distinct subclones or, more

likely, deployment of targeted therapies only in patients for
whom the drug target is entirely clonal.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Sample Selection and Quality Assessment of DNA
Bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples were collected at
Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium (MMRC) institutions from patients
diagnosed with MM or related diseases and then shipped to the MMRC Tissue
Bank for processing as previously described (Ahmann et al., 2008). The studies
were approved by the Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental
Subjects of MIT, protocol no. 0803002647. All patients provided written
informed consent under institutional review board approval. Sample process-
ing was slightly modiﬁed from previous reports (Salhia et al., 2010) as
described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Whole-Exome Sequencing, Whole-Genome Sequencing, and
Detection of Copy Number Variations
Whole-exome capture libraries were constructed from 100 ng of tumor and
normal DNA after shearing, end repair, phosphorylation, and ligation to bar-
coded sequencing adapters (Fisher et al., 2011; Gnirke et al., 2009). Ligated
DNA was size-selected for lengths between 200 and 350 bp and subjected
to exonic hybrid capture using SureSelect v2 Exome bait (Agilent). Samples
were multiplexed and sequenced on multiple Illumina HiSeq ﬂow cells
(paired-end 76 bp reads) to an average depth of coverage of 893 and 883
for tumor and normal, respectively. For whole-genome sequencing, library
construction was done with 1–3 mg of native DNA from primary tumor and
germline samples for each patient. The DNA was sheared to a range of 101–
700 bp using the Covaris E210 Instrument and was then phosphorylated
and adenylated according to the Illumina protocol. Adaptor ligated puriﬁcation
was done by preparatory gel electrophoresis, and size was selected by exci-
sion of two bands (500–520 bp and 520–540 bp, respectively), yielding two
libraries per sample with average of 380 bp and 400 bp, respectively. The
libraries were then sequenced with the Illumina GA-II or Illumina HiSeq
sequencer with 76 or 101 bp reads, achieving an average of 303 coverage
depth. The resulting data were analyzed with the current Illumina pipeline,
which generates data ﬁles (BAM ﬁles) that contain the reads and quality
parameters. Copy number variations of 153 patients of the sequencing cohort
were determined by Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array. Sequencing data are available
in the dbGaP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) under accession
number phs000348.
Analysis of Whole-Genome and Whole-Exome Sequencing Data
For a detailed description, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Myeloma Cell Lines, MM Cell Proliferation, and BRAF Inhibition
A human-derived BRAF-mutant cell line (U266) and three BRAF-wild-type
cell lines (OPM2, MM1S, and SKMM1) were plated at 1.0 3 106 cells/ml (total
2.0 3 106 in 2 ml) in 6-well plates. For western blotting, cells were then treated
with concentrations of 0 mM, 2.5 mM, or 10 mM BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 for 1 hr
or 24 hr. After treatment, cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 5 min with
300 ml of a modiﬁed NP40 lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM
NaCl, 2 mM EDTA [pH 8], 1 mg/ml NaF, and deuterium depleted water) for
western blot analysis. For determination of the proliferation of MM cell lines
in the presence of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trame-
tinib, 3,000 cells per well were plated in quadruplicate in a 384-well plate in the
presence of the indicated drug concentrations.
Western Blot Analysis of MAPK Pathway after PLX4720 Treatment
Lysate protein concentrations were obtained using the BIO-RAD DC Protein
Assay kit, and concentrations were subsequently adjusted to 1 mg/ml ﬁnal
concentrations. Twelve micrograms of protein from each cell lysate was
run per well on NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris Midi Gels (Life Technologies
WG1403BX10). The gel was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane paper
(Invitrogen LC2001) using the iBlot gel transfer device (Life Technologies
IB1001). The membrane was subsequently blocked (Li-Cor Blocking Buffer
927-40000) for 1 hr and stained as described in the Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures.
