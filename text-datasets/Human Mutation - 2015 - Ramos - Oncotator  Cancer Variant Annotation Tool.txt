ABSTRACT: Oncotator is a tool for annotating genomic point mutations and short nucleotide 
insertions/deletions (indels) with variant- and gene-centric information relevant to cancer 
researchers.  This information is drawn from 14 different publicly available resources that have 
been pooled and indexed, and we provide an extensible framework to add additional data 
sources.  Annotations linked to variants range from basic information, such as gene names and 
functional classification (e.g. missense), to cancer-specific data from resources such as the 
Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), the Cancer Gene Census, and The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA).  For local use, Oncotator is freely available as a python module hosted on 
Github (https://github.com/broadinstitute/oncotator).  Furthermore, Oncotator is also available as a 
web service and web application at http://www.broadinstitute.org/oncotator/.   ©2015 Wiley-Liss,

INTRODUCTION 
Variant annotation, the aggregation and reporting of data relevant to a given genomic alteration, is a key step in 
a sequencing data analysis pipeline and is crucial for subsequent interpretation of detected variants.  Genome 
sequencing of cancer samples typically reveal thousands to tens of thousands of somatic mutations per tumor that 
are often unique to the individual tumor (equivalent to ‘singletons’ in a germline analysis) (Lawrence et al., 2013). 
Therefore, researchers rely on annotations to filter variants to a subset of alterations that are most important to a

given study or application.  At the most basic level, variant annotations help researchers identify the genes, 
transcripts, and genomic regions pertaining to a given variant, as well as predict the impact an alteration has on the 
translated protein product of a gene.  With the emergence of large databases of germline (Sherry et al., 2001; 
Landrum et al., 2013; NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project, 2014) and somatic (Forbes et al., 2010) variation, 
synthesis of all available clinical and biological information for single variants greatly empowers researchers to 
distinguish driver mutations from passengers (Imielinski et al., 2014), link specific variants to patient phenotypes 
(Van Allen et al., 2013; Biesecker and Green, 2014), and uncover unexpected oncogenic mechanisms shared 
across diseases (Lawrence et al., 2013).  For example, variant annotations such as the frequency of a mutation in 
published cancer genomic studies, or whether a significant functional effect is predicted by algorithms such as 
Polyphen-2 or SIFT (Kumar et al., 2009; Adzhubei et al., 2010), can be utilized to interpret and prioritize variants.  
For clinicians, variant annotations can be of immense aid for clinical interpretation of variants as annotations can 
identify genetic events associated with cancer prognosis/diagnosis or drug sensitivity/resistance (Van Allen et al., 
2013; Biesecker and Green et al., 2014). 
Numerous tools, such as ANNOVAR, SnpEff, and Variant Effect Predictor, exist for annotating sequencing 
variants; however, many were developed for general non-cancer applications (Le Pera et al., 2010; McLaren et al., 
2010; Wang et al., 2010; Cingolani et al., 2011; Sana et al., 2011).  Although cancer sequencing studies use many 
of these tools, variants may lack cancer-specific annotations that can aid in downstream interpretation. 
Here we report Oncotator, a cancer variant annotation pipeline implemented as a command line tool, as well as 
a web application, which provides both an interactive user interface and a programmatic web service.  As currently 
deployed, Oncotator allows users to annotate variants with a pre-packaged bundle of cancer-relevant information 
in a single step. Oncotator has been used internally in the Broad Institute’s Cancer Genome Analysis pipeline since 
2011, resulting in its use in over 20 published cancer studies, including several large scale (>100 tumors) efforts 
conducted by TCGA, NHGRI, TARGET, and the Slim Initiative for Genomic Medicine collaboration (Bass et al., 
2011; Berger et al., 2011; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011, 2013, 2014; Chapman et al., 2011; 
Hammerman et al., 2011; Stransky et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Banerji et al., 2012; Barbieri et al., 2012; 
Barretina et al., 2012; Berger et al., 2012; Hodis et al., 2012; Imielinski et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012; Lohr et al., 
2012; Pugh et al., 2012, 2013, 2014; Ciriello et al., 2013; Francis et al., 2013; Lawrence et al., 2013; Ojesina et al., 
2013).  The goal of this article is to make the scientific community aware of the first public release of Oncotator 
(version 1.5) that is free to non-profit users. In the past two years, large parts of Oncotator were refactored to 
support: (i) highly optimized annotations; (ii) customizable data sources; and (iii) deployment outside of the Broad 
Institute environment. 
 
METHODS 
As a starting point for annotation, Oncotator requires the genomic position, reference allele, and variant allele 
as input in TSV, VCF (Danecek et al., 2011), or muTect call_stats (Cibulskis et al., 2013) formats.  Variants are 
currently annotated with data from 14 different resources (Table 1), described briefly below.  Annotated variants 
can be output in TCGA MAF or VCF formats, regardless of which input format is used (with the unintended 
consequence that researchers often use the tool for format conversion).  Names and versions of the datasources are 
included in the header of output files.   
Oncotator uses a local indexed database of reference transcripts derived from GENCODE to map variants to 
specific genes (Harrow et al., 2012).  Each variant is assigned a “variant classification” (e.g. “Splice_Site” or 
“Nonsense_Mutation”) based on the mutation’s position relative to an overlapping gene and the expected 
consequence, if any, that the mutation has on a translated protein product. The model of reference transcript 
selection used is user-defined by a command line argument or can be left to automatically use the model with the 
greatest deleterious effect. Variant classification terms defined by the TCGA are used and nomenclature adheres to 
specifications defined by the Human Genome Variation Society (http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen) (Dunnen et al., 
2000). 
In addition to basic transcript annotations described above, Oncotator will annotate variants with annotations 
derived from sources that can be beneficial to researchers looking to prioritize variants.  To identify common 
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) variants (which are less likely to contribute to tumorigenesis), Oncotator 
utilizes data from dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project, and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Exome 
Sequence Project (Sherry et al., 2001; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium. 2010; NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing

Project, 2014).  Oncotator can also annotate variants with the local GC content (within 100 base-pairs, by default) 
and surrounding nucleotide context (within 10 base-pairs, by default).  Such annotations can be helpful for 
identifying biological mutational processes with sequence-specific mutation (Lawrence et al., 2013; Alexandrov et  
al., 2013) or artifactual mutation biases such as oxidation of guanine bases during sequencing library construction 
(OxoG) (Costello et al., 2013).

Predicting the functional impact of somatic mutations in cancer can be aided by mapping coding DNA sequence 
variants in genes onto amino acid sequences and proteins they encode.  For example, knowledge of the specific 
protein regions that variants affect can be used to identify particular protein domains or active sites that are 
enriched for mutations across multiple samples or even across genes containing similar domains.  To this end, 
Oncotator can annotate genomic variants with protein-specific annotations derived from UniProt human protein 
sequence records (UniProt Consortium, 2011).  Oncotator maps genomic variants to protein position-based 
annotations derived from the feature table section of a UniProt record.  Protein annotations added include “region” 
(e.g. protein kinase domain), “site” (e.g. ATP binding site), ”natural variation” (e.g. Y → F in Pfeiffer syndrome), 
and “experimental” (e.g. Y → F: 50% decrease in interaction with PIK3C2B) data, if available.  Furthermore, 
UniProt records are utilized to derive Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, describing the biological process, cellular 
component, and molecular function of a gene; and DrugBank annotations, pertaining to small molecules known to 
target the protein of interest (Knox et al., 2011).  Through the dbNSFP (Liu et al., 2011) Oncotator datasource, 
variants can also be annotated with pre-computed results derived from many functional prediction and 
conservation score algorithms (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutationTaster, Mutation Assessor, FATHMM, LRT, SiPhy,

GERP++ and PhyloP), which can be used to classify variants most likely to have an impact on a protein’s function 
(Siepel et al., 2006; Chun and Fay, 2009; Garber et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2009; Adzhubei et al., 2010; Davydov 
et al., 2010; Schwarz et al., 2010; Reva et al., 2011; Shihab et al., 2013). 
 
Oncotator also annotates variants with data from several cancer-specific resources that may aid in 
interpreting variants.  Using data from COSMIC, Oncotator identifies variants reported in published studies and 
reports their observed frequency across all cancers and within each tissue type (Forbes et al., 2010). Overlapping 
breakpoint and fusion genes in COSMIC are also provided.  Cancer researchers can also benefit from knowledge 
of relevant cancer cell line models in which to perform follow-up in vitro experiments with.  To this end, 
Oncotator utilizes data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia to identify if a variant has been previously 
observed in a cell line (Barretina et al., 2012) (http://www.broadinstitute.org/ccle/home).  Other cancer-specific 
resources utilized include the Cancer Gene Census (Futreal et al., 2004), ClinVar (Landrum et al., 2014), the 
Familial Cancer Database (http://www.familialcancerdatabase.nl/), and a curated set of DNA repair genes (Wood 
et al., 2005). 
 
IMPLEMENTATION 
Oncotator is available as a command line tool written in the Python programming language 
(https://www.python.org/).  This tool is recommended for advanced users and is ready for inclusion into automated 
pipelines, since the annotation options, selection of data sources, and file formats are more flexible. The Oncotator 
software is an annotation framework that is broken into a three-stage workflow: (i) convert the input data into an 
internal model of mutations; (ii) annotate the mutation objects with a collection of pre-processed datasources 
(which can be locus-, variant- or gene-specific); and (iii) render the mutations to the specified output format (VCF 
or MAF).  The software architecture encapsulates each step, which allows easy implementation of input and output 
formats by decoupling file formats from the actual annotation engine.  The encapsulation also eased the 
development of hundreds of automated test modules, some testing hundreds of scenarios, that allow developers to 
make code changes and be confident that their changes have not unintentionally broken previous functionality 
(regression tests).  Using the default corpus of datasources on a machine with a solid-state drive, Oncotator will 
take approximately 30 minutes to annotate 100,000 variants (~18 ms per variant).  This runtime can be greatly 
reduced to approximately 11 minutes (~6.6 ms per variant) if a cache is utilized (with the ‘-u’ option). 
We recognize that researchers would like to extend variant annotations beyond the current available datasources 
in Oncotator.  Therefore, we included in Oncotator tools for creating new datasources from TSV, VCF, and GTF 
files.  Most of the default Oncotator datasources were created using these tools.  New versions of datasources are 
created from scratch and are not updated in-place, however, this typically only requires the updated data and 
making minor adjustments to the datasource creation command.  Users are encouraged to contribute to the project 
via a publicly available Github repository (https://github.com/broadinstitute/oncotator).  Although the tool was 
initially developed for cancer research, Oncotator can address non-cancer needs and additional non-cancer 
datasources can be easily introduced.  Periodically, we make updated and new datasources available, as part of the 
versioned default corpus.  In the future, we plan to add datasources specific to whole genome sequencing analysis, 
such as conservation scores outside of the exome, as well as add functionality for annotation of genomic regions. 
 
Oncotator is also available as a web application at http://www.broadinstitute.org/oncotator/.  Users can input 
a tab-delimited text file containing genomic coordinates and allele genotypes for each variant.  Annotation results 
are presented as interactive tables.  Annotation runtimes using the web application vary according to the input size 
but users can monitor the time to completion with a continuously updated progress bar on the report page.  Users 
can also download a tab-delimited file containing multiple columns corresponding to the different annotations that 
are aggregated.  The Oncotator web service is implemented using a REST-like architecture to facilitate integration 
with existing applications and pipelines.  Users can also retrieve variant annotations programmatically using HTTP 
requests 
in 
the 
form: 
http://www.broadinstitute.org/oncotator/mutation/<chromosome>_<start_position>_<end_position>_<reference_a
llele>_<observed_allele>.  Results are returned as JSON objects (http://json.org/) which can be easily parsed by 
users.
