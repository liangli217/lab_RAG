abstract
PURPOSE Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a precursor condition of multiple myeloma (MM) with
a 10% annual risk of progression. Various prognostic models exist for risk stratiﬁcation; however, those are based
on solely clinical metrics. The discovery of genomic alterations that underlie disease progression to MM could
improve current risk models.
METHODS We used next-generation sequencing to study 214 patients with SMM. We performed whole-exome
sequencing on 166 tumors, including 5 with serial samples, and deep targeted sequencing on 48 tumors.
RESULTS We observed that most of the genetic alterations necessary for progression have already been acquired
by the diagnosis of SMM. Particularly, we found that alterations of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway
(KRAS and NRAS single nucleotide variants [SNVs]), the DNA repair pathway (deletion 17p, TP53, and ATM
SNVs), and MYC (translocations or copy number variations) were all independent risk factors of progression
after accounting for clinical risk staging. We validated these ﬁndings in an external SMM cohort by showing
that patients who have any of these three features have a higher risk of progressing to MM. Moreover, APOBEC
associated mutations were enriched in patients who progressed and were associated with a shorter time to
progression in our cohort.
CONCLUSION SMM is a genetically mature entity whereby most driver genetic alterations have already occurred,
which suggests the existence of a right-skewed model of genetic evolution from monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined signiﬁcance to MM. We identiﬁed and externally validated genomic predictors of progression that
could distinguish patients at high risk of progression to MM and, thus, improve on the precision of current clinical
models.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell
malignancy with signiﬁcant inter- and intrapatient het-
erogeneity. It is almost always preceded by asymptom-
atic precursor stages, namely monoclonal gammopathy
of undetermined signiﬁcance (MGUS) and smoldering
multiple myeloma (SMM).1,2 Patients with SMM have
a higher risk of progression to MM (10%/year) compared
with MGUS (1%/year).3 Although some patients progress
rapidly, others remain in an MGUS-like state for years.
Current prognostic models do not fully capture SMM
progression risk because patients who are considered
to be intermediate or low risk by those criteria can still
progress. This might be because these models are
based mainly on tumor burden markers and may not
adequately reﬂect the underlying biology that could be
critical for disease progression. Thus, there is an ur-
gent need for novel prognostic markers that can ac-
curately identify patients with SMM who are at risk for
progression and could beneﬁt from early treatment.
Herein, we studied 214 samples from patients with
SMM to comprehensively characterize the genomic
landscape of SMM and identify biomarkers of pro-
gression to MM.
METHODS
We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) tech-
nologies to study 214 samples from patients with SMM
at the time of diagnosis, including 5 serial samples. We

performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 72 matched
tumor-normal samples and 94 tumor-only samples and
targeted deep sequencing on 48 samples. Patients who
presented at diagnosis with MM symptoms, including hy-
percalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, or bone lytic le-
sions or who had any myeloma-deﬁning event were
excluded from the analysis.4 Patients with light-chain and
nonsecretory SMM were included because they are
understudied subtypes and their biology needs to be better
understood. All samples were obtained after written in-
formed consent in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Time-to-event end points were estimated using
the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in survival curves
were assessed using log-rank tests. Median follow-up was
calculated using the reverse Kaplan-Meier method. Time to
progression (TTP) was measured from the date of diagnosis
to the date of documented progression to MM. Cox pro-
portional hazards modeling was performed to assess the
impact of genetic alterations on risk of disease progression.
Statistical analysis is described in detail in the Data Sup-
plement (online only).
RESULTS
The Genomic Landscape of SMM
The median age in our cohort was 62 years (range, 34-85
years). Patients were stratiﬁed into low-, intermediate-, and
high-risk groups on the basis of the Mayo 2008 criteria5 and
the revised Mayo 2018 criteria6 (Data Supplement).
The genomic landscape of the entire cohort is illustrated in
Figure 1, with single nucleotide variants (SNVs), somatic
copy number alterations (SCNAs) and translocations dis-
played in separate sections, and patients sorted according
to their clinical risk stage. Immunoglobulin heavy chain
translocations commonly seen in MM were present in 76
patients (36%) as identiﬁed by ﬂuorescence in situ hy-
bridization, while SCNAs were the most common genomic
alterations and were present in 189 patients (88%).
Hyperdiploidy (HRD; ie, with $ 48 chromosomes in the
genome) was found in 55% of patients; hypodiploidy
(deﬁned as , 45 chromosomes) was found in only 10
patients (4.6%) and whole-genome doubling (ploidy . 2.5)
in 6 (2.8%). The median mutation density in patients with
SMM was 1.4 mutations/Mb, and SNVs in genes signiﬁ-
cantly mutated in MM were present in 118 patient samples
(55%). Forty-six percent of those had alterations in the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (KRAS,
NRAS, BRAF, and PTPN11). DNA repair pathway alter-
ations (TP53 and ATM SNVs and deletion [del] 17p) were
found in 21 (10%). SNVs in genes of nuclear factor-kB,
protein processing, and cell cycle pathways were found in
22%, 21%, and 6.7% of patients, respectively. Biallelic
inactivation events that affected TP53, RB1, CDKN2C,
ZNF292, DIS3, or FAM46C were present in only 6% of
patients. Copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
was observed in 44 patients (27%), with chromosome 16
most frequently affected (20%), followed by chromosomes
1 (16%) and 6 (11%). Of note, 36 LOH events were clonal,
and 31 events were subclonal. No signiﬁcant focal am-
pliﬁcations were discovered in our data set (n 5 166) by
GISTIC2. However, 4 focal deletions were considered
signiﬁcant (del 1p22.1, del 6q27, del 14q24.3, and del
14q32.31), all of which contained putative tumor sup-
pressors (Data Supplement). In fact, patients with del
1p22.1 and del 14q24.3 had a shorter TTP (P 5 .009 and
.02, respectively; Data Supplement). Of note, the most
common MM whole-chromosome and arm-level copy
number alterations (CNAs), including gains of 1q and
chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, and 21 as well as del
13q and del 16q, were signiﬁcant events (Data supple-
ment). In terms of alteration co-occurrence, we observed
that HRD often signiﬁcantly co-occurred with mutations in
KRAS and NRAS, while t(11;14) was signiﬁcantly mutually
exclusive with HRD and gain of 1q (Fig 2A). On the other
CONTEXT
Key Objective
The identiﬁcation of the patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) who will eventually progress to overt malignancy
can allow for early intervention to prevent end-organ damage and potentially achieve long-term remission. Current risk
models are based on solely clinical markers and often lack precision and accuracy to predict progression. We hy-
pothesized that genomics can improve the prediction of progression from SMM to overt multiple myeloma (MM).
Knowledge Generated
Most genetic alterations have already occurred by the time of SMM diagnosis, which suggests that next-generation se-
quencing (NGS) can be used at that stage for reliable prognostication. Alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase
and DNA repair pathways or MYC are independent risk factors of progression, whose addition to current clinical risk
models signiﬁcantly improves prediction of progression.
Relevance
Clinical-grade NGS at the SMM stage can be used to identify patients at high risk of progression to MM who might beneﬁt
from early intervention approaches for better outcomes.

hand, t(4;14) co-occurred with mutations in DIS3, BRAF,
del 13q, and gain 1q. Del 13q was shown to co-occur
infrequently with HRD and rarely with NRAS; however, it
co-occurred frequently with del 16q and gain 1q. Our
analysis also showed that del 1p frequently co-occurred
with del 8p and 17p.
The Clonal Architecture and Phylogeny of SMM
We observed heterogeneity in the clonality of mutations that
affected recurrently mutated genes in MM. Certain genes
(TP53, KLHL6, DIS3, MAX, NFKBIA, and CCND1) carried
clonal alterations more frequently, while other genes were
more frequently subclonal (FAM46C, NFKB2, LTB, and

TRAF3), which likely represent later events in the disease
course (Fig 2C). Of note, mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and
BRAF were subclonal in 64%, 70%, and 86% of patients,
respectively. In contrast, our analysis showed that SCNAs
were clonal in most of the samples, especially trisomies of
odd-numbered chromosomes that were clonal in 98%, with
the exception of trisomies 9, 19, and 21, which were found
to be subclonal in a few samples (Fig 2B). Moreover, del
13q, 14q, and 16q and gain 1q were also clonal in 78%,
76%, and 72%, and 68%, respectively. These data suggest
that SCNAs are largely founder events, while SNVs in the
MAPK pathway are later events that contribute to tumor
progression.
We next analyzed serial samples from 5 patients sampled at
2 time points of at least 1 year apart (range, 1-8 years). We
observed evidence of clonal heterogeneity in all 5, which
indicated that clonal branching had already happened at
the smoldering stage. While copy number abnormalities
were mostly clonal in all 5 samples, we observed evidence
of subclonal copy number events in 3 patients (SMM_060,
del 13q/del 1p; SMM_002, del 17p; SMM_093, del 14q,
del 20p; Figs 3A-3C); all these events were associated with
signiﬁcant clonal expansion at the late time points, which
suggests that copy number events have strong driving
potential and eventually become clonal, even when ac-
quired during progression. The majority of alterations
present at progression were already present at the SMM
stage; however, in 1 of 5 patients (SMM_060) sampled with
a 5-year interval, there was evidence of a newly acquired
subclone carrying a KRAS mutation as well as del 13q/del
1p, during progression. In another patient (SMM_064),
a subclone carrying mutations in KRAS, TP53, CDKN2C,
and DIS3 seemed to have occurred during progression;
however, both time points had low tumor purity that pre-
cluded such conclusion. In 1 patient who has not pro-
gressed (SMM_077) and was sampled twice at the SMM
stage with an 8-year interval, no new alterations or increase
in tumor burden was observed (Fig 3D), which suggests
that the presence of clonal branching and heterogeneity is
not enough to lead to disease progression but, instead,
either the functional impact of genomic alterations or tumor
cell-extrinsic factors could be the determining factor. In all 5
patients, we observed changes in the cancer cell fraction of
subclones.

clinical trial setting before progression to MM. Their
baseline characteristics are reported in the Data Supple-
ment. Median follow-up time for all patients was 6.2 years.
Median TTP was 3.9 years. In this cohort, 53 patients
(62%) have progressed, while 32 (38%) have remained
asymptomatic.
The genomic landscape is
illustrated
according to progression status in the Data Supplement.
Patients who harbored MYC aberrations (translocations or
ampliﬁcations) had the shortest median TTP (8.4 v 51.6
months; P , .001) followed by those with MAPK pathway
mutations (14.4 v 60 months; P , .001) and DNA repair
pathway alterations (15.6 v 50.4months;P5 .004;Figs 4A-4C).
Moreover, t(4;14), as well as del 1p, del 8p, and biallelic deletion
events (including TP53, RB1, DIS3, MAX, and CDKN2A), were
associated with shorter TTP (Data Supplement).
MAPK pathway mutations and MYC alterations were as-
sociated with higher bone marrow inﬁltration at the time of
diagnosis (P 5 .001 and , .001, respectively). MAPK
pathway mutations were the only alteration that signiﬁcantly
correlated with M-protein levels (P , .001), while none of
these high-risk genomic alterations correlated with free light
chain ratio (Data Supplement). Of note, although not
a high-risk feature, t(11;14) was associated with the light
chain SMM subtype (P 5 .002) and lower M-protein levels
compared to other primary events (Data Supplement).
Developing a Genomic Model for Prediction of Progression
to MM
We searched for independent risk factors of progression
from SMM to MM to develop a genomic model for pre-
diction of progression (Data Supplement). Four genomic
features were independent predictors of progression: MYC
aberrations, alterations in the DNA repair and MAPK
(KRAS, NRAS SNVs) pathways, and t(4;14) translocation
(Data Supplement). Of note, in a multivariable model that
accounted for the Mayo 2018 clinical risk stratiﬁcation, all
but t(4;14) were independent risk factors of progression
(Fig 4D). Thus, our model is predicated upon these three
genomic alterations.
Patients with $ 1 high-risk genomic alterations had sig-
niﬁcantly shorter TTP (1.2 v 7.2 years, respectively; P ,
.001; Fig 5C). Moreover, patients with 0, 1, or $ 2 high-
risk factors, had a signiﬁcantly different TTP (Data Sup-
plement), while patients with any of these high-risk al-
terations by the Mayo 2018 model (1.3 v 3.4 years; P 5
.006). Furthermore, clinically intermediate- and high-risk
patients with these genomic alterations had signiﬁcantly

shorter TTP (2.6 v 9.3 years [P 5 .004] and 1.2 v 3.5 years
[P 5 .001], respectively; Figs 5A and 5B), and our results
were independent of the clinical model used (ie, Mayo
2008 or 2018; Data Supplement). Of note, high-risk ge-
nomic alterations were found in patients described as low
risk by both models, in whom they conferred a signiﬁcantly
increased risk of progression (Data Supplement). Im-
portantly, our genomic model improved the prediction of
progression when added to the Mayo 2008 or 2018
models (C-statistic, 0.66 v 0.75 and 0.72 v 0.77, re-
spectively; likelihood ratio test P , .001; Table 1; Data
Supplement).
External Validation of the Genomic Prediction Model

we validated it in an external cohort of 72 patients with

a median TTP of 5 years. The cohort’s characteristics are
listed in the Data Supplement. Again, we found that pa-
tients with any of the high-risk genomic alterations (n 5
47) had a higher risk of progression (2.5 v 10 years; P 5
.001; Fig 5D). Similarly, patients with 0, 1, or $ 2 high-risk
factors had different risks of progression (Data Supple-
ment). Moreover, low-, intermediate-, and high-risk pa-
tients, as deﬁned by the Mayo 2018 model, with high-risk
genomic alterations had shorter TTP (9.7 v not reached
[P 5 .028] and 2.3 v 6.9 years [P 5 .01], respectively;
Data Supplement). These ﬁndings held true when we
used the Mayo 2008 model as well (Data Supplement).
Importantly, in a multivariable analysis that accounted for
clinical risk group in this cohort, the genomic model was
an independent risk factor of progression; when com-
bined with the 2008 or 2018 clinical models, the genomic
model performed better than the clinical model alone
(C-statistic, 0.57 v 0.66 and 0.61 v 0.67, respectively;

Mutational Signatures in SMM and Their Impact
on Progression
We analyzed our WES data for speciﬁc mutational signatures
that play an important role in myeloma pathogenesis and
development: aging (COSMIC SBS1 and SBS5), adenosine-
induced deaminase (AID), and apolipoprotein B mRNA
editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) sig-
natures. As expected, the majority of mutations were
associated with aging signatures, while there was approxi-
mately equal contribution of AID (n 5 217) and APOBEC
(n 5 250) signatures. Among myeloma recurrently mutated
genes, the majority of events were attributable to aging
signatures. However, we observed APOBEC-associated
mutations in 14 MM driver genes, and AID-associated
mutations in 11 (Data Supplement). Of note, all 3 muta-
tions in ZNF292 were attributed to APOBEC, and t(14;16)
had a signiﬁcantly higher number of APOBEC mutations
compared with the rest of the cohort (P 5 .005).
AID-associated mutations were observed in most of the pa-
tients, with no signiﬁcant difference between progressors and
nonprogressors (P . 0.99; Data Supplement). However, we
found APOBEC to be signiﬁcantly enriched in patients who
progressed, after accounting for total mutation burden (P 5
.029; Data Supplement). Patients with versus those without
APOBEC-associated mutations and those with more than the
median number of APOBEC mutations (2.5) had shorter TTP
(Data Supplement). Of note, although approximately 40% of
APOBEC-associated mutations were clonal, patients with
. 50% subclonal APOBEC-associated mutations were
enriched for progressors (P 5 .046). Although APOBEC can
be an early event in certain patients, these data indicate that
continuous activity may underlie disease progression.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we leveraged NGS technology to analyze
diagnostic tumor samples of 214 patients with SMM. We
observed that SMM has similar genetic makeup to newly
diagnosed MM, with similar mutation density and clonal
heterogeneity. Although most of the SCNAs were clonal, del
1p and del 17p were mainly subclonal, which suggests that
not all SCNAs are acquired early in a single catastrophic
event and that in some cases, the clonal CNA proﬁle could
reﬂect the serial acquisition of certain SCNAs that even-
tually grew into clonal status. Indeed, in 3 of our patients
with serial samples available, some clonal SCNAs at pro-
gression were subclonal at SMM diagnosis. On the other
hand, SNVs that affect the most common MM drivers were
mainly subclonal, which suggests that they are acquired
later during disease progression. Nevertheless, mutations
in KLHL6, TP53, DIS3, and MAX were mostly clonal, which
indicates that in certain instances, driver mutations can
perhaps be acquired early and drive clonal expansion.
Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that MM disease
progression, from tumorigenesis all the way to SMM and
overt MM, is likely governed by the serial acquisition of
genetic alterations, most of which will have been acquired
by the time of SMM diagnosis. It should, however, be
noted that in all 5 patients with serial samples, we found
evidence of clonal evolution, with subclonal cancer cell
fractions changing over time, which argues against the
existence of a static model of progression in which the
exact same clonal composition is observed in both the
SMM and the MM stage.8 On the basis of our ﬁndings, we
can expect some new driver alterations to be acquired
between SMM diagnosis and progression to MM in a few
patients; however, for the majority of patients, the tumor’s
genetic makeup will have been largely shaped by the time
of SMM diagnosis. This right-skewed model of MM genetic
evolution, whereby the bulk of genetic alterations have
already occurred by the time of SMM diagnosis, allows for
reliable prognostication on the basis of genetic biomarkers
discovered at SMM diagnosis.
Given these observations, we asked whether we could
leverage diagnostic SMM samples to identify genomic
predictors of progression that reﬂect an aggressive un-
derlying biology and act independently of tumor burden.
Speciﬁcally, we analyzed 85 untreated patients, excluding
those who had been treated on SMM clinical trials. We
found that mutations affecting genes in the MAPK and DNA
repair pathway, as well as MYC translocations or ampliﬁ-
cations, were all associated with a higher risk of progression
to MM, even after accounting for the two currently used
clinical risk stratiﬁcation models. Namely, patients with
SMM who carried any of the aforementioned alterations
were at higher risk of progression compared with those in
the same clinical risk group without them. Furthermore, we
successfully validated our model in an external cohort of
patients with SMM. In both cohorts, the genetic model

improved the prediction of progression when added to the
current clinical models, as assessed by both a likelihood
ratio test and the C-statistic, which suggests that these
genetic biomarkers are robust and can be reliably used for
improved prognostication.
In an era where clinical-grade NGS is available in many
centers, we could envision the stratiﬁcation of patients with
SMM being based on both clinical and genomic biomarkers.
One of the limitations of the current clinical models is that they
do not accurately predict progression risk in SMM patients.
Our model helped identify genetic alterations that deﬁne
a biologically aggressive subtype and are as important
a predictor as increased tumor burden. And while MAPK/
DNA repair pathway alterations and MYC aberrations should
certainly be part of the prognostic genomic features, on the
basis of the results from this and other studies,7 there are
more features that seem to be signiﬁcant predictors of pro-
gression, which suggests that larger cohorts are necessary to
assess their impact. Such candidates include gene expres-
sion signatures in SMM,9 del 1p, del 8p, and APOBEC activity.
In conclusion, sequencing a large cohort of patients with
SMM has allowed us to understand that SMM is a geneti-
cally mature tumor with slight differences from overt my-
eloma, which suggests a right-skewed model of genetic
evolution from MGUS to MM whereby most driver genetic
alterations have already occurred by the SMM stage.
Therefore, we believe that genomic proﬁling of patients’
tumors at the time of SMM diagnosis represents an im-
proved strategy for identifying patients at high risk of
progression who could beneﬁt from early intervention.
