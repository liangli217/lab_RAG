SUMMARY
H€urthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid (HCC) is a form of thyroid cancer recalcitrant to radioiodine therapy that
exhibits an accumulation of mitochondria. We performed whole-exome sequencing on a cohort of primary,
recurrent, and metastatic tumors, and identiﬁed recurrent mutations in DAXX, TP53, NRAS, NF1, CDKN1A,
ARHGAP35, and the TERT promoter. Parallel analysis of mtDNA revealed recurrent homoplasmic mutations
in subunits of complex I of the electron transport chain. Analysis of DNA copy-number alterations uncovered
widespread loss of chromosomes culminating in near-haploid chromosomal content in a large fraction of
HCC, which was maintained during metastatic spread. This work uncovers a distinct molecular origin of
HCC compared with other thyroid malignancies.
Signiﬁcance
H€urthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid (HCC) is a form of thyroid cancer with a marked increase in mitochondria. HCC exhibits
both a failure to concentrate radioactive iodine and avidity for ﬂuorodeoxyglucose, an imaging signature suggestive of
metabolic reprogramming. We performed a parallel analysis of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of HCC using exome
sequencing. We identiﬁed distinct genomic features of HCC, including alterations in mtDNA complex I subunits, and wide-
spread chromosomal losses leading to a near-haploid state. A driver role for these events was further suggested by the
maintenance, and convergent evolution, of these genetic features in related primary tumors and distant metastases.

INTRODUCTION
H€urthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid (HCC) is a type of oncocytic
neoplasm responsible for approximately 3% of all thyroid can-
cers, and has traditionally been classiﬁed as a variant of follicular
thyroid cancer (Wada et al., 2002). H€urthle cells are large, polyg-
onal cells with variable nuclear atypia, and a prominent, granular
cytoplasm as a result of mitochondrial abundance (Maximo
and Sobrinho-Simoes, 2000). Oncocytic change or metaplasia
(referred to as H€urthle cell change in the thyroid gland), reﬂecting
mitochondrial accumulation, occurs in non-neoplastic condi-
tions, such as chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto’s) thyroiditis, as
well as benign and malignant neoplasms originating in several
organs, including kidney, adrenal gland, salivary gland, thyroid,
and others (Gasparre et al., 2010).
Although a diagnosis of minimally invasive HCC (exhibiting in-
vasion only through the tumor capsule or at most a few foci of
vascular invasion) portends a low risk of recurrence or metas-
tasis, widely invasive HCC (with extensive vascular invasion) ex-
hibits more frequent recurrences and distant metastases (Stoja-
dinovic et al., 2002). Compared with relatively indolent forms of
thyroid cancer, including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and
follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), HCC exhibits a greater inci-
dence of distant metastases and reduced progression-free sur-
vival (Sabra et al., 2016; Shaha et al., 1996). Further complicating
the clinical management, HCC infrequently concentrates radio-
active iodine, used for both imaging and treatment of well-differ-
entiated thyroid cancer (Haugen et al., 2016; Pryma et al., 2006).
H€urthle cell tumors conversely show intense uptake of ﬂuoro-
deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) by PET imaging (Pathak et al., 2016;
Pryma et al., 2006). The increased 18F-FDG uptake and mito-
chondrial accumulation point to metabolic reprogramming in
HCC and suggest unique biological features compared with
other forms of thyroid cancer. This notion is supported by the
description of a distinct gene expression signature in HCC
compared with PTC and FTC (Ganly et al., 2013).
Studies of the somatic genetic alterations in HCC are limited.
Prior targeted analyses suggested that HCC harbors distinct
alterations compared with other forms of thyroid cancer with infre-
quent mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway,
TP53, PTEN, and MEN1, along with infrequent PAX8/PPARg rear-
rangements (Evangelisti et al., 2015; Kasaian et al., 2015; Nikifor-
ova et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2015). Two genomic features of
HCCs, not frequently observed in PTC and FTC, have been re-
ported from studies of small numbers of HCCs. First, mitochon-
drial-encoded mutations were reported to be a marker of benign
and malignant oncocytic thyroid tumors. However, whether these
mutations act as passengers or drivers has not been established
(Gasparre et al., 2007). In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
across many chromosomes was reported in oncocytic thyroid tu-
mors(Corveret al.,2012, 2014).Whether the mitochondrial orLOH
events occur in the context of other genomic alterations, and
whethertheseeventsareprevalentinrecurrentandmetastaticdis-
ease has not been addressed. In this study, we utilized whole-
exome sequencing (WES) to characterize the genomes of surgi-
cally resected HCC primary tumors, regional recurrences, and
distant metastases. We performed a parallel analysis of the nu-
clear and mitochondrial genomes of primary and metastatic tu-
mors to uncover the genetic drivers of HCC.
RESULTS
Recurrent Nuclear-Encoded Mutations
Exome sequencing was performed on 70 HCC specimens ob-
tained from 41 patients, as well as matched DNA isolated from
blood or adjacent normal thyroid (Table S1). The cohort included
32 (47%) primary tumors (P), 13 (19%) distant metastases (DM),
and 25 (34%) locoregional recurrences (LR), thereby represent-
ing various disease states (Figure S1A). We ﬁrst compared over-
all frequencies of non-silent exonic mutations between clinically
deﬁned subsets of HCC, including minimally invasive primary
tumors (MIPs), widely invasive primary tumors (WIPs), and DM/
LRs, as well as to The Cancer Genome Atlas study of PTC
(consisting of primary tumors) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2014). The non-silent mutation frequency in DM/LRs
was higher than that observed in MIPs (DM/LR median,
0.7/Mb; range, 0.1–6.97 versus MIPs median, 0.4/Mb; range,
0.03–0.9, Wilcoxon test, p = 0.0006; Figure S1B; Table S2).
Compared with PTC, WIPs, but not MIPs, exhibited statistically
higher non-silent mutation frequencies (WIPs median, 0.6/Mb;
range, 0.2–16.13 versus PTC median, 0.4/Mb; range, 0.03–
2.17; Wilcoxon test, p = 0.025).
To identify signiﬁcantly mutated genes, we integrated muta-
tion data, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and short
insertions and deletions (indels), from all 70 samples. To avoid
double-counting mutations observed in different samples from
the same patient, we created one ‘‘aggregated tumor’’ for each
patient, which represented the union of mutations observed in
all samples obtained from each patient. Multiple occurrences
of the same event were counted once in order to catalog only
independently arising mutations (the pre-aggregated mutation
data are shown in Figure S1C). We found DAXX, TP53, NRAS,
and NF1 (Figure 1A, upper) to be signiﬁcantly mutated using
MutSig2CV (Lawrence et al., 2013). We also performed a
restricted recurrence analysis using 326 previously published
cancer genes (Forbes et al., 2017; Lawrence et al., 2014), and
identiﬁed two additional recurrently mutated genes, CDKN1A
and ARHGAP35 (gene names depicted in green). Finally, we
manually reviewed the data and identiﬁed additional mutations
in known oncogenes and tumor suppressors (TS), including
those previously identiﬁed in thyroid cancer (Figure 1A, middle)
(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014). Mutations in
TSHR, BRAF, EIF1AX, MEN1, PTEN, MTOR, ATM, MSH6, and
NFE2L2 were also identiﬁed. Based on the cancer cell fraction
(CCF) of each mutation, calculated using ABSOLUTE, most
putative driver mutations were predicted to be clonal events
(CCF R 0.9), i.e., existing in all tumor cells in the sample, sup-
porting an early origin during tumor outgrowth (median CCF in
individual tumors of 0.99; Figure S1C) (Carter et al., 2012; Landau
et al., 2013).
We also used targeted sequencing approaches to identify so-
matic alterations not detected by exome sequencing, including
TERT promoter variants and fusion transcripts relevant to thyroid
cancer (Landa et al., 2013; McFadden et al., 2014a). Hotspot
TERT promoter mutations (C228T and C250T) were identiﬁed
in 18/49 tumors from 12/38 (32%) patients from which sufﬁcient
nucleic acid was obtained (Figure 1A, lower; Table S3). Focal
ampliﬁcations of the TERT gene were also observed in three tu-
mors from two patients (Figures 1A, lower and S2, see below).

TERT alterations, including promoter mutations and ampliﬁca-
tions, were mutually exclusive with DAXX mutations (Fisher’s
exact test on patient mutational level; p = 0.018), suggesting
multiple mechanisms of stabilizing telomere length acted in
HCC (Heaphy et al., 2011; Maciejowski and de Lange, 2017).
One PAX8-PPARg fusion was identiﬁed in a tumor lacking
alterations in other well-established driver genes (Figure 1A,
lower). Out of 29 independent nuclear mutations identiﬁed
by exome sequencing and selected for validation, 24 (83%)
were conﬁrmed by VariantPlex sequencing (Table S3, STAR
Methods). Of 5 mutations failing this validation experiment,
4 were not adequately covered by validation sequencing
reads; therefore, 24/25 (96%) adequately covered mutations
were validated, suggesting high-ﬁdelity mutation calling by our
WES pipeline.
Early Widespread Chromosomal Loss Leads to a Near-
Haploid State in HCC
Analysis of somatic DNA copy-number alterations (SCNAs),
including determination of absolute allelic copy numbers (using
ABSOLUTE), revealed widespread chromosomal losses leading
to LOH across most of the genome and a near-haploid chromo-
somal content in the majority of tumors (38/70, 54%; Figures 1B
and 2). Retained disomies of chr 5, chr 7, chr 12, and chr 20
suggested selection against the loss of these chromosomes.
In contrast, few focal SCNAs were observed (Figure S2). We
reviewed focally ampliﬁed and deleted regions in individual
tumors for known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes
previously reported to be signiﬁcantly altered in a pan-cancer
analysis, and identiﬁed infrequent focal SCNAs in these genes
(Table S4) (Zack et al., 2013)
We analyzed the distribution of ploidies observed in HCC, and
identiﬁed three patterns in aggregated tumors, following a clas-
siﬁcation previously described for adrenocortical carcinoma:
(1) ‘‘near-haploid’’ with a mean ploidy %1.6 (17/41 patients,
41.46%); (2) ‘‘quiet’’ with a mean ploidy of >1.6 to %2.5 (19/41,
46.34%), including 7 near-diploid cases; (3) ‘‘complex’’ with a
mean ploidy >2.5 (5/41, 12.2%) (Figure 1B, top), in some cases
due to whole-genome duplication (WGD) (Carter et al., 2012;
Zheng et al., 2016). Of note, four aggregated tumors (HCC-3,
HCC-13, HCC-102, and HCC-9) exhibited a mean ploidy >1.6
to %2.5 due to the occurrence of both widespread LOH (>20
arms) and WGD. WGD occurred in 9/41 (22%) patients in our
cohort with 5 of these patients showing evidence of widespread
LOH (>20 arms; Figures 1B, bottom and 2).
We
experimentally
conﬁrmed
ploidy
predictions
from
ABSOLUTE using two complementary methods (Figures 3,
S3A, and S3B). First, we performed ﬂuorescence in situ hybridi-
zation (FISH) in 23 tumors, using probes for chromosomes 4, 7,
and 8. FISH analysis was largely concordant with ABSOLUTE
and AllelicCapSeg, but also revealed intratumoral heterogeneity
in tumor populations exhibiting complex ploidy (Figures 3,
middle column and S3A). Second, we analyzed the nuclear
DNA (nDNA) content of individual tumor nuclei isolated from
parafﬁn-embedded sections using imaging ﬂow cytometry
(IFC) of propidium iodide-stained nuclei. IFC enabled image
collection of each event in both bright-ﬁeld and ﬂuorescent
channels in order to conﬁrm that modal peaks consisted of
largely whole, intact nuclei. These studies conﬁrmed approxi-
mately 2N nDNA content in diploid tumors, whereas near-
haploid samples exhibited reduced (1N) nDNA content and
complex samples showed increased (>2N) nDNA content (Fig-
ures 3, right column and S3B).
Genome wide loss of one copy of most chromosomes in HCC
might endow a bias toward tumor suppressor mutations by
enabling complete gene inactivation as the result of a single
mutational event. Consistent with this possibility, mutations in
the tumor suppressor genes DAXX, TP53, NF1, CDKN1A,
ATM, PTEN, and MSH6 were enriched in tumors with wide-
spread LOH (>20 arms), compared with those without such chro-
mosomal loss events (<20 arms; Fisher’s exact test; p = 0.0001),
resulting in biallelic inactivation of these genes (Figure S1C).
Complex I mtDNA Mutations as Driver Events in HCC
We next identiﬁed somatic mtDNA-encoded alterations from
the exome sequencing data (STAR Methods). Coverage of the
mtDNA was uniform and of high depth in control (83X) and tumor
(314X) samples, with only one patient (HCC-43) excluded due to
insufﬁcient coverage (Figure S4A). Large deletions, including the
common 4,977 bp deletion, were not detected (Schon et al.,
1989). The overall mutational spectrum of the HCC mtDNA
was similar to a recent International Cancer Genome Consortium
(ICGC) pan-cancer analysis of mtDNA from 1,664 tumors
across 31 cancers, including a strong strand bias for C > T
and T > C transitions on the heavy and light strand, respectively
(Figure S4B) (Ju et al., 2014).
Analysis of the mitochondrial genome revealed 29 protein-
coding and 17 non-coding mutations with variant allele fraction
(VAF) R 0.3 (Table S5). Recurrent somatic loss-of-function
(LOF) and missense mtDNA mutations were identiﬁed in genes
encoding subunits of complex I of the electron transport chain
in 21/40 patients (Figures 1A, lower and 4A). A leucyl-tRNA so-
matic variant MT-TL1:m.G3244A, which was previously reported
to be pathogenic in an inherited case of mitochondrial encepha-
lomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes, a syn-
drome associated with complex I deﬁciency, was recurrently
mutated in 3/40 patients (Kirino et al., 2005; Mariotti et al.,
1995). This mutation was absent from the 1,664 tumors in a
pan-cancer analysis (Ju et al., 2014). In total, 24/40 (60%) aggre-
gated tumors harbored alterations predicted to impact complex I
function. Complex I mtDNA variants were validated in 10/10
samples selected for PCR and Sanger sequencing (Table S5).
Given that complex I is encoded by mitochondrial and nuclear
genomes, we also searched for somatic alterations in the nuclear
genome that were likely to disrupt complex I but did not identify
recurrent mutations with a high likelihood of being pathogenic.
Several lines of evidence suggested a driver function of mito-
chondrial-encoded complex I mutations. First, complex I muta-
tions were more prevalent in HCC compared with the ICGC
pan-cancer analysis of 1,664 tumors from 31 cancer types (Ju
et al., 2014). Speciﬁcally, while HCC exhibited a higher overall
rate of mtDNA somatic mutations (Figure 4B), the increase was
entirely driven by a 3-fold enrichment in protein-modifying
mutations within complex I genes (p = 2 3 107 Fisher’s exact
test; Figure 4C). Conversely, no enrichment was observed for
silent and non-coding variants, or alterations in complex III, IV,
and V in HCC. Moreover, considering all protein-modifying
variants, we noted a signiﬁcant enrichment for mutations with

VAF R 0.3 in complex I genes in HCC compared with the ex-
pected background mutation frequency observed in the pan-
cancer analysis (88% versus 60%, p = 0.007 based on two-sided
test of proportions, Figure S4C). Second, in HCC but not in
the pan-cancer analysis, protein-altering complex I, but not
complex III, IV, or V, mutations exhibited higher VAF than si-
lent/non-coding mutations, consistent with positive selection
for complex I loss (Figures 4D and S4D). Speciﬁcally, in HCC
complex I LOF and missense variants showed signiﬁcantly
higher VAFs versus silent/non-coding variants (median VAF
0.98 and 0.78 versus 0.17, p = 103 and p = 9 3 103, respec-
tively, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test), whereas the pan-can-
cer analysis showed signiﬁcantly lower VAF for LOF variants
(Figure 4D). Third, in HCC, complex I missense mutations
occurred preferentially at highly conserved residues (Figure 4E),
and mapped to regions within the highly charged central axis
believed to be important for redox coupling and proton translo-
cation based on the high-resolution crystal structure of complex

I available from Thermus thermophilus (Figure 4F; Table S5)
(Baradaran et al., 2013). Together, these ﬁndings suggest that
mtDNA-encoded complex I alterations act as drivers in HCC.
Chromosomal Content Is Stable during Metastatic
Progression of HCC
We next examined the evolution of the nuclear and mitochondrial
genomes during disease progression. A near-haploid genome
has been described as an unstable, unfavorable state, which is
rescued by subsequent WGD (Corver et al., 2012; Taylor-Weiner
et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2016). This leads to tumors with a
‘‘pseudo-diploid,’’ or uniparental disomy, chromosomal state
(Safavi and Paulsson, 2017). In contrast to these studies, we
observed cases in which related families of primary tumors, local
recurrences, and DM harbored near-haploid nDNA content
(9/14, 64%; Figure 5, top). WGD was observed in a minority of
HCC tumor families (4/14, 29%; Figure 5, bottom). The observa-
tion that the near-haploid state was maintained during metasta-
tic seeding and recurrence of HCC suggested that subsequent
genome doubling was not under positive selection during meta-
static colonization or emergence, or that genome doubling is
mechanistically infrequent in these tumors.
Mutational Evolution during Metastatic Progression
of HCC
Evolutionary relationships across multiple tumors resected from
individual patients were reconstructed using PhylogicNDT with
TERT promoter and mtDNA complex I mutations manually map-
ped onto phylogenetic trees. All 14 patients with recurrent and/or
metastatic disease in our cohort showed a branched pattern of
tumor evolution suggestive of a common ancestor in all cases
(Figures 6A and S5A). We ﬁrst identiﬁed shared mutations across

tumor families obtained from each individual patient, as these
were likely to represent early driver alterations. Widespread
chromosomal losses were the most frequently observed truncal
event, occurring in 13/14 tumor families (Figure 6B). WGD
occurred in only 4/14 patients: two truncal events (HCC-81 and
-7), one late event (HCC-102), and one convergent branch event
(HCC-3), reiterating the stability of the near-haploid state during
tumor evolution. Truncal complex I mtDNA mutation, present in
6/14 patients, was the next most frequent early alteration.
TERT promoter alterations were observed in 8/14 tumor families,
including 2/14 with clear evidence of truncal emergence (HCC-3
and -76) and 4/14 families with presumed truncal emergence
based upon the presence of the event in all samples with
adequate sequencing coverage. Among the putative driver mu-
tations identiﬁed in this study, truncal alterations in NF1 (2/14),
DAXX (1/14), PTEN (1/14), and ATM (1/14) were also observed.

We identiﬁed only one patient (HCC-17) with a classical pattern
of tumorigenesis in which an initiating oncogene mutation (in
this case, TSHR) was followed by inactivation of a tumor sup-
pressor gene (TP53) and emergence of nDNA copy-number al-
terations (Figure S5A).
We also observed evidence for convergent evolution of
putative driver events with independent mutations arising in
distinct evolutionary branches in 5/14 patients. Independent
alterations in DAXX and CDKN1A (HCC-84), TP53 (HCC-25),
TERT (HCC-81 and 102), mtDNA complex I genes (HCC-102),
and WGD (HCC-3) were observed (Figures 6A and S5A).
As an example, we found one patient (HCC-84) harboring
different DAXX and CDKN1A mutations in the primary and the
recurrent tumor, consistent with convergent evolution and
supporting a non-clonal origin of these events. In another pa-
tient (HCC-81), the primary and recurrent tumors harbored
different TERT promoter mutations. The convergent evolution
of mutations in these genes provided strong evidence of a
driver role for these alterations, including at later stages of tu-
mor evolution.

Although genomic analysis of related families of primary
tumors and recurrent/metastatic lesions was prioritized over
analysis of large numbers of primary tumors, we determined
associations between primary tumor genotype and two impor-
tant clinical outcomes, recurrence-free survival (RFS) (which
included local recurrences and DM), and the time to develop-
ment of DM. Although RFS was not statistically different between
MIP and WIP cases (Figure S5B), the development of DM was
signiﬁcantly increased in WIP cases (Figure S5C), consistent
with prior studies (Ghossein et al., 2006). A larger fraction of
WIP tumors exhibited widespread LOH (8/11) compared with
MIP (7/19); however, this was not statistically signiﬁcant (Fisher’s
exact test, nominal p = 0.13, Figure S5D). TP53 mutation was
only observed in WIP tumors (3/11, Fisher’s exact test, nominal
p = 0.04). No other event was signiﬁcantly enriched in MIP or
WIP tumors. In contrast, distant metastatic disease was signiﬁ-
cantly associated with primary tumors harboring widespread
LOH (Fisher’s exact test, nominal p = 2 3 104, Figure S5E),
and TERT alteration (promoter mutation or ampliﬁcation, Fisher’s
exact test, nominal p = 0.03). We therefore further examined
potential associations between widespread LOH and clinical
outcomes.

associated
with
decreased RFS (Figure S5F, Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.003) and
the development of distant metastasis during the observation
period (Figure S5G, Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.001). Widespread
LOH was the most signiﬁcant predictor of poor outcome in this
cohort, being a stronger predictor of recurrence and distant
metastasis than primary tumor invasiveness (compare Figures
S5B–S5F and S5C–S5G).
DISCUSSION
This parallel analysis of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes
of HCC primary tumors, local recurrences, and metastases re-
veals three primary ﬁndings: (1) the near-haploid state is com-
mon in HCC, occurs early, and is stable throughout the course
of the disease; (2) complex I mtDNA mutations are early clonal
events maintained during tumor evolution, and therefore likely
drivers and not simply markers; and (3) a distinct set of nDNA
driver genes is expanded to include DAXX, CDKN1A, and
ARHGAP35.
These
alterations
appear
uniquely
enriched
in
HCC
compared with other cancers. We show that mtDNA com-
plex I mutations are enriched in HCC compared with a pan-
cancer analysis (Ju et al., 2014). In addition, widespread LOH
has not been observed in other forms of thyroid cancer,
including conventional FTC, of which HCC was considered a
subtype (Jung et al., 2016). Similarly, a clinical sequencing
study of poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma,
in which recurrent widespread LOH was not identiﬁed, further
suggests widespread chromosomal losses are not simply a
feature of progression to advanced disease in thyroid carci-
noma (Landa et al., 2016). A small number of HCC cases
harbored alterations in oncogenes and TS associated with
FTC and PTC, including BRAF, NRAS, TSHR, EIF1AX, and
PAX8-PPARg, which are considered to be tumor initiating
alterations. Therefore, these alterations also appear capable
of driving tumorigenesis in the context of H€urthle cells. Alter-
ations in TP53 and ampliﬁcations or promoter mutations im-
pacting TERT expression have been identiﬁed in clinically
aggressive forms of thyroid cancer (Landa et al., 2016). The
observance of these events in HCC suggests that the mecha-
nisms driving the development of advanced disease in HCC
overlap with other forms of thyroid carcinoma.
This study raises several questions—what are the functional
effect(s) of mutations in complex I and widespread chromosomal
losses, and how do these events confer ﬁtness advantage?
Disruptive mutations in complex I could in theory lead to the
production of a metabolite with oncogenic function, similar to
tumors with IDH1 and other tricarboxylic acid cycle mutations
(Sabharwal and Schumacker, 2014). Alternatively, mutations in
complex I could protect from cell death, since complex I has
been implicated in interferon- and p53-induced cell death, or
facilitate the alternative use of metabolic intermediates to
support anabolic processes required in HCC for proliferation
(Compton et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2007; Shaham et al.,
2010). The observation of complex I alterations in the two
adenomas included in this study suggests that additional
events are necessary to promote tumor progression. Whether
complex I mutations and the near-haploid state co-evolve during
tumor progression or arise from independent selective pressures
remains an open question. Interestingly, haploid human embry-
onic stem cells exhibit a more than 30% increase in the mtDNA
to nDNA ratio when compared with diploid cells, suggesting
potential synchronization between nuclear and mitochondrial
genomes (Sagi et al., 2016).
Widespread loss of chromosomes leading to the near-haploid
state, an extensive, ordered form of aneuploidy distinct from
most cancer genomes, was the most frequently observed early
event by phylogenetic analysis (Beroukhim et al., 2010; Zack
et al., 2013). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the near-
haploid state arises early and unmasks a selective advantage
for the metabolic consequences of complex I mutation or coop-
erates with additional mutations in genes encoding canonical
TS. The latter hypothesis is congruent with the observation
that mutations in TS genes that were recurrently altered in
HCC were more frequently observed in near-haploid cases. In
the near-haploid genome, complete TS gene inactivation re-
quires merely a single hit. However, given the absence of wide-
spread chromosomal losses in most cancer genomes, massive
LOH is unlikely to be a prerequisite for biallelic inactivation of
TS genes in HCC (Beroukhim et al., 2010). Therefore, enrichment
for TS gene mutations in near-haploid HCC tumors might simply
reﬂect the potential for single events to result in complete
TS inactivation in this sensitized background. Alternatively,
the near-haploid state may lead to gene dosage imbalances,
that are noted at the end. Below each tree, a timeline depicts the sequence of diagnosis and tissue sampling. P, primary tumor; DM, distant metastasis; LR,
locoregional recurrence; LN, lymph node.

or cumulative haploinsufﬁciences (Davoli et al., 2013; Solimini
et al., 2012). The strong association of widespread chromosomal
loss with recurrence and metastatic disease is intriguing. How-
ever, whether widespread chromosomal loss represents an in-
dependent predictor of outcome will require additional studies
considering the limitations of the current study, including retro-
spective design, potential for selection bias, duration of clinical
follow-up, and limited sample size.
Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that widespread chromo-
somal losses generally appeared prior to other events, support-
ing the notion that selective pressures operative at early stages
in HCC initiation and outgrowth drive the emergence of the
near-haploid state. Although the driving force underlying wide-
spread chromosomal loss is unclear, it is notable that other
tumors prone to chromosomal losses, such as adrenal cortical
carcinoma (ACC) and chromophobe kidney cancer, also acquire
recurrent alterations in DAXX, TP53, and the TERT promoter
(Assie et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2016). In our
cohort, DAXX and TERT promoter mutations were mutually
exclusive, and DAXX mutations were more frequently observed
in near-haploid tumors. This suggests that HCC employs multi-
ple strategies of telomere maintenance and raises the possibility
that ALT is favored in the context of a near-haploid genome.
These ﬁndings reinforce the association between telomere
stabilization and genome instability (Chiba et al., 2017; Fleisig
et al., 2016; Heaphy et al., 2011; Maciejowski and de Lange,
2017; Marinoni et al., 2014).
The stability of the near-haploid state during clonal evolu-
tion of HCC is distinguished from ACC in which WGD was
observed following widespread nDNA loss (Zheng et al.,
2016). Furthermore, unlike colorectal and bladder cancers,
in which nDNA copy-number alterations were discordant
between primary tumors and metastases (Bambury et al.,
2015; Mamlouk et al., 2017), the near-haploid state of HCC
was maintained during metastatic outgrowth, in some cases
over several years.
Our work provides a molecular roadmap for the identiﬁcation
of targetable genomic and metabolic vulnerabilities in HCC.
Studies are warranted to determine whether the near-haploid
state leads to a liability due to collateral copy loss of essential
genes—a genetic state that might be leveraged by agents target-
ing such copy-number dependencies (Muller et al., 2012; Nijha-
wan et al., 2012). Whether this concept underlies occasional
responses of HCC to cytotoxic chemotherapeutics remains an
open question (Besic et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012). The devel-
opment of therapies that target the metabolic consequences
of complex I impairment or the potential dependency of
HCC genomes on telomere-stabilizing mechanisms (via TERT
or ALT pathways) also represent other directions of future
research (Birsoy et al., 2014; Shaham et al., 2010; Vafai
et al., 2016). Finally, the development of new model systems of
HCC, upon which to interrogate hypotheses developed from
the framework of alterations described here, represents an
important future endeavor.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human Tissue Studies
Cases of HCC were identiﬁed via a natural language search of the electronic medical record at Massachusetts General Hospital using
the terms H€urthle and oncocytic to identify cases between 01/01/1990 – 05/21/2013. Patients with HCC were also prospectively
identiﬁed after that time period leading to a collection of cases with surgery performed between 1994-2015. Individual pathology
reports were reviewed by D.G.M. to identify carcinoma samples. This led to a cohort of n=70 samples derived from n=41 patients.
Clinical annotation of each sample, including patient characteristics derived from the medical record, can be found in Table S1.
Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded histopathology blocks were obtained from tissue archives and slides were reviewed by an expert
endocrine pathologist (P.M.S.). Regions of high tumor cellularity were circled and excised. DNA was then isolated from the excised
tissue using the AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit (QIAGEN) and submitted for whole exome sequencing (Broad Institute). All specimens
were obtained and sequenced with approval of the Partners Human Research Committee (protocol #2013P000811).
METHOD DETAILS
Nuclear Genome Analysis
Whole exome sequencing was performed using the Illumina exome with all targets from the Agilent exome design (Agilent SureSelect
All Exon V2), all coding regions of Gencode V11 genes, and all coding regions of RefSeq gene and KnownGene tracks from the UCSC
genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Pooled libraries were normalized to 2nM and denatured using 0.2 N NaOH prior to
sequencing. Flowcell cluster ampliﬁcation and sequencing were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols using either
the HiSeq 2000 v3 or HiSeq 2500. Each run was a 76bp paired-end with a dual eight-base index barcode read. Data was analyzed
using the Broad Picard Pipeline which includes de-multiplexing and data aggregation. Data derived from whole exome sequencing
were processed using established analytical tools. The Picard pipeline (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) aligned sequencing reads to
the hg19 human genome build. These BAM ﬁles were uploaded into the Firehose platform (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/
cga/Firehose), which coordinates the ﬂow of datasets through distinct algorithms. Tumor and normal genotypes were compared
for concordance. ContEst was used to estimate the level of cross-contamination (Cibulskis et al., 2011). OxoG artifacts, which could
arise due to oxidation of a G base pair on only one strand during fragmentation, and FFPE-induced artifacts were ﬁltered (Costello
et al., 2013). Joint re-alignment was performed using the Novoalign and blat ﬁlters. A panel of normal samples (PoN) was used to ﬁlter
the remaining false positives, including potential sequencing artifacts and germline sites missed in the matched normal tissue (Cibul-
skis et al., 2013). Additionally, to recover mutations lost to tumor-in-normal contamination from adjacent tissue controls we applied
the deTiN pipeline (Rheinbay et al., 2017). The latest version of MuTect (Cibulskis et al., 2013) was used to call somatic single-nucle-
otide variants (SNVs) and Strelka (Saunders et al., 2012) to call small insertions or deletions (indels) on each tumor-normal pair. The
consequence of all coding was annotated using Oncotator (Ramos et al., 2015). Manual review of mutations was performed using
Integrated Genomics Viewer (Thorvaldsdo´ ttir et al., 2013) and alterations that were invalid based on this IGV review were excluded
from the ﬁnal results (including mutations called only on duplicate reads, mutations with orientation bias, mutations called on reads
that also contained indels and other low allelic fraction SNVs, mutations called in regions with poor mapping).
Somatic Copy Number Analysis
Copy number alterations were estimated using ReCapSeg (http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/categories/recapseg- docu-
mentation). For each tumor sample, the read coverage proﬁle of each target segment was ﬁrst normalized with the total number
of aligned reads. Then, a panel of normal samples (PoN) sequenced at the same target regions was used to normalize the read depth
at each capture probe. These normalized target regions were segmented and gave rise to copy number data. The allelic copy number
ratio was estimated by integrating allele fraction data from heterozygous germline variants in the tumor sample that were detected in
the matched normal sample. The AllelicCapSeg tool was used to combine copy number and allele fraction data (http://archive.
broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/acsbeta). The contribution of each homologous allele to copy number alterations (including copy
neutral events) was inferred from allelic copy numbers (Stachler et al., 2015; Brastianos et al., 2015; Brastianos et al., 2017).
Purity, Ploidy, and Phylogeny
We performed a ‘force-calling’ method to identify mutations shared across several samples from the same individual (Stachler et al.,
2015). This process allowed us to aggregate all SNVs found in each tumor sample from a patient. These force-called mutant and
reference allele counts for each mutation as well as allelic copy numbers were used as input to ABSOLUTE (Carter et al., 2012) to
provide ploidy and purity estimates for each tumor. ABSOLUTE solutions were manually curated. Subsequently, total allelic copy
numbers and cancer cell fractions (CCF) were generated. Using ABSOLUTE allelic copy numbers clonal focal copy number changes
were identiﬁed and manually reviewed. These segments were analyzed for regions exhibiting signiﬁcant SCNA alterations that have
been reported previously (Zack et al., 2013). Cases with altered genomic locations described to have a clear target gene in this pre-
vious pan-cancer analysis were summarized.
To analyze the phylogenetic relationship between populations across tumors from one individual we used PhylogicNDT (Landau
et al., 2017), an extension of Phylogic (Landau et al., 2013; McFadden et al., 2014b), that takes the cancer cell fraction (CCF) distri-
butions provided by ABSOLUTE to determine the phylogenetic tree that best represents the clonal evolution among multiple tumor
Cancer Cell 34, 242–255.e1–e5, August 13, 2018
e2

samples from the same patient. PhylogicNDT is an N-dimensional Bayesian clustering framework based on mixtures of Dirichlet
Processes (Escobar and West, 1995), where the number of clusters is inferred over many Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
iterations. Phylogenetic trees were drawn for each individual using the CCF estimates of these clusters for clonal mutations, post-
assigning clonal SCNAs. This was done using a neighbor-joining algorithm (Biopython) based on the jaccard distance metric (SciPy)
for each sample (Cock et al., 2009).
Validation of Nuclear Variants
Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed using anchored multiplex PCR (AMP) and previously described methodologies
(Zheng et al., 2014). Total nucleic acid was isolated from FFPE tumor tissue using the Agencourt FormaPure Kit (Beckman Coulter).
A customized version of the VariantPlex Solid Tumor Kit (Custom Design VariantPlex Kit, ArcherDX Inc.) was used to validate a
subset of nuclear variants identiﬁed by WES, and for the detection of hotspot mutations in the TERT gene promoter (Table S3).
The assay detects single nucleotide variants (SNV) and insertion/deletions present at R5% allelic frequency in regions of genomic
DNA with sufﬁcient read coverage and targets the following genes (exons): ABL1 (4-7), AKT1 (3,6), ALK (21-23,25), APC (16), ARID1A
(1-20), ATM (1-63), ATRX (1-35), AURKA (2,5-8), BRAF (11,15), BRCA1 (2-23), BRCA2 (2-27), CCNE1 (3-8,10,12), CDH1 (1-16), CDK4

(8,10,19-21,24), ERBB3 (2-3,7-8), ERBB4 (3-4,6-9,15,23), ESR1 (8), EZH2 (16), FBXW7 (1-11), FGFR1 (4,7-8,13,15,17), FGFR2
(7,9,12,14), FGFR3 (7-9,14-16,18), FLT3 (11,14,16,20), FOXL2 (1), GNA11 (5), GNAQ (4-5), GNAS (6-9), H3F3A (2), HNF1A (3-4),
HRAS (2-3), IDH1 (3-4), IDH2 (4), JAK2 (11,13-14,16,19), JAK3 (4,13,16), KDR (6-7,11,19,21,26-27,30), KEAP1 (2-6), KIT
(2,8-11,13-15,17-18), KRAS (2-5), MAP2K1 (2,3,6-7), MAP3K1 (1-20), MDM2 (2-4,6,8,10), MEN1 (2-10), MET (2,11,14,16,19,21),
MLH1 (12), MPL (10), MSH6 (1-10), MSI, MYC (1-3), MYCN (3), NF1 (1-58), NF2 (1-15), NOTCH1 (25-27,34), NPM1 (11), NRAS
(2-5), PIK3CA (2,5,7-8,10,14,19,21), PIK3R1 (1-10), POLE (9-14), PTCH1 (1-23), PTEN (1-9), PTPN11 (3,13), RB1 (1-27), RET
(10-11,13-16), RHOA (2-3), RNF43 (2-10), ROS1 (38), SDHB (1-8), SMAD2 (7), SMAD4 (2-12), SMARCA4 (3-36), SMARCB1
(2,4,5,9), SMO (3,5-6,9,11), SRC (14), STAG2 (3-34), STK11 (1-9), SUFU (1-12), TERT (1), TP53 (1-11), TP63 (1-14), TSC1 (3-23),
TSC2 (2-42), TSHR (10), VHL (1-3). We attempted validation of all nuclear variants that were detected by exome sequencing and
targeted by the VariantPlex genotyping assay. A total of 59 samples from 40 patients were tested (Table S3). Of these, 7 samples
had unavailable data (indicated as N/A, column D, Table S3). The remaining 52 tumors (from 37 individuals) harbored 31 unique
nuclear variants. We conﬁrmed 24/29 (83%) of those variants by genotyping or Sanger sequencing (column D, Table S3). Visual
inspection of VariantPlex sequencing data for each individual locus revealed that 4 out of the 5 variants that we were unable to vali-
date (column E, Table S3), were not adequately covered by unique sequencing reads, and were thus inconclusive. Therefore, out of
the 25 nuclear variants that could be appropriately assessed in the region of interest, 24 (96%) were conﬁrmed by genotyping and
Sanger sequencing, indicating high-ﬁdelity mutation calling by our WES pipeline.
Detection of Gene Rearrangements
Assessment of gene rearrangements was accomplished using the FusionPlex Solid Tumor Kit (ArcherDX Inc.), a targeted fusion
assay designed to detect fusion transcripts in reverse transcribed double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), obtained from sam-
ples with R5% tumor cellularity. The fusion assay detects rearrangements in the following genes (exons): ADCK4 (1-2, 4-6, 9-10,
12-15), AKT3 (1-2, 13), ALK (1, 3, 17, 19-22, 29), AR (1-4, 6, 7-8), ARHGAP6 (1-3), ARHGAP26 (10- 13), AXL (14-15), BRAF (1-2,
8-11, 17), BRD4 (1, 10-12), CCDC6 (1-8), CD74 (1-8), CHTOP (2- 6), EGFR (7-9, 14-18, 23-28), ERBB2 (2-4), ERBB4 (17-18, 20),
ESR1 (3-5), EWSR1 (1, 3-8, 12-13), FGFR1 (1, 7-13, 16-18), FGFR2 (3-4, 17), FGFR3 (3, 7-12, 15-18), FGR (2-3), INSR (13-18,
21-22), INSRR (13-18, 21-22), JAK1 (1-7, 9-25), JAK2 (1, 6, 9, 11-12, 16-17, 19, 24), MAML2 (2-4), MAST1 (2, 8, 19-20, 26, 29),
MAST2 (1, 5), MET (2, 11-16, 20-21), MUSK (8-9, 11-14), NFIB (1, 7-9), NOTCH1 (2, 27-28, 34), NOTCH2 (1, 27, 33), NRG1 (2-4,
6), NTRK1 (1, 8-17), NTRK2 (9-11, 13-20), NTRK3 (1, 11-16, 18-19), NUMBL (3-7, 9-10), NUTM1 (2-3), PDGFB (1-2, 6), PDGFRA
(1, 9-11, 13-14, 20-23), PIK3CA (2-3), PKN1 (9-14), PLAG1 (2-4), PPARG (3-8), PRKACA (2-4), PRKCA (3-7), PRKCB (3-7), RAF1
(1, 9-11, 17), RET (1, 8-13, 19), RHOA (1-5), ROS1 (1, 31-37, 43), TMPRSS2 (1-5). Double stranded genomic DNA (VariantPlex)
or reverse-transcribed cDNA (FusionPlex) was enzymatically sheared, end-repaired, adenylated, and ligated with a half-functional
adapter. The sequencing library was generated using two hemi-nested PCR reactions following the manufacturer’s VariantPlex
and FusionPlex Protocols for Illumina, respectively. Next-generation sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq
2x150 (Illumina) (Zheng et al., 2014).
mtDNA Variant Calling and Validation
All WES reads mapping either to GRCh37 chromosome MT or to 1049 nuclear sequences of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs) (Li et al.,
2012) were re-aligned to mtDNA revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (NC_012920 equivalent to GRCh37 chromosome MT)
using GATK version 3.3 (McKenna et al., 2010), BWA version 0.7.10 (Li and Durbin, 2009), and Picard Tools version 1.119
(broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Variants were detected via the GATK HaplotypeCaller assuming a mixture of 20 chromosomes
(HaplotyperCaller -ploidy 20 -L MT:1-16569 –heterozygosity 0.01 -contamination 0). The HaplotypeCaller’s estimate of variant allelic
fraction (VAF; equivalent to heteroplasmy in normal samples) was used to identify somatic mutations using the following seven ﬁlters:
(1) VAFR0.05 in tumor; (2) VAF%0.05 in matched normal; (3) if variant detected at low VAF in matched normal (i.e. 0<VAF%0.05),
then tumor VAFR0.25; (4) Variant supported by >5 reads in tumor; (5) Depth R15X in tumor; (6) Depth R10X in matched normal;
(7) StrandBias FS score<20. Depth ﬁlters were derived from published power calculations (Cibulskis et al., 2013). Manual inspection
e3
Cancer Cell 34, 242–255.e1–e5, August 13, 2018

of reads was performed on all variants VAFR0.3. Six priority variants VAFR0.3 that were excluded by depth criteria (m.4830G>A,
m.5032G>A, m.6352T>C, m.6745G>A, m.12769GA>G, m.12778G>A) were included in our analysis with 2 of these variants being
validated by Sanger sequencing, while 3 others were found in multiple tumors from a single patient. Variants were annotated using
online Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) (McLaren et al., 2016) (June 2016, Gencode basic transcripts). Very similar somatic mutation
calls were obtained using the Mutect2 tool from GATK version 3.6 (McKenna et al., 2010) (parameter initial_normal_lod=0.0, no
ﬁltering applied); speciﬁcally, 40/46 variants VAFR0.3 by either pipeline were detected in both pipelines. Analysis of variants
VAFR0.3 was limited to mutations that exceeded 0.3 both using HaplotypeCaller’s estimate of allelic fraction as well as point esti-
mates using all reads passing quality ﬁlters. To identify mtDNA deletions, we searched for split-reads using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013)
(parameters –outSJﬁlterOverhangMin 12 –alignSJoverhangMin5 –scoreDelOpen -10000 –scoreInsOpen -10000), ﬁltering for break
points supported by at least 3 split-reads on each strand.
Ten randomly selected non-silent variants with VAFR0.3 in mitochondrial complex I genes were validated by Sanger sequencing in
tumors. The primers utilized for mtDNA complex I genes are provided in Table S6.
mtDNA Pan-Cancer Comparative Analysis
HCC mtDNA variants were compared to published mtDNA somatic mutations detected in a pan-cancer analysis of 1664 tumor sam-
ples (Ju et al., 2014), including both single nucleotide variants and indels. Variant allele frequency and gene annotations were derived
from published tables. LOF mutations included stop-gained (nonsense) and frameshift indels. Silent and non-coding variants
included synonymous coding variants, intergenic regions, D-Loop regions, tRNAs and rRNA mutations. MELAS comparisons
included all 19 known tRNA mutations associated with the syndrome annotated in MitoMap (Brandon et al., 2005) (positions 583,
1630, 1642, 1644, 3243, 3244, 3252, 3256, 3258, 3260, 3271, 3291, 4332, 5541, 8316, 12147, 12206, 12299, 14693). Evolutionary
conservation scores were calculated for each position corresponding to a missense mutation. The Amino Acid Conservation Score
indicates the number of species with identical residues across a pre-computed alignment of the mitochondrial genome across
44 vertebrate species (Lindblad-Toh et al., 2011), as described previously (Calvo et al., 2006). To search for LOF germline variants,
we applied VEP to all published germline variants, which included only single nucleotide variants with VAFR0.3 and did not include
indels or low heteroplasmy variants.
Complex I Structural Analysis
We mapped the human missense HCC mutations onto the 3.3 A˚ resolution X-ray structure of complex I from Thermus thermophilus
(PDB: 4HEA) (Baradaran et al., 2013). Amino acid sequences of human complex I subunits (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5, and
ND6) were aligned with the corresponding subunits of Thermus thermophilus (Nqo8, Nqo14, Nqo7, Nqo13, Nqo11, Nqo12, and
Nqo10, respectively) using Clustal Omega (Soding, 2005). With the exception of S531N mutation in ND5, for which the sequence
alignment was uncertain, all other mutations were found in evolutionarily conserved segments of the protein. Figures illustrating
the location of the mutations in the structure were generated with PyMOL 2.0 (http://www.pymol.org/). The proton pumping domains
of ND5, ND4 and ND2 were superimposed using ‘‘align’’ function of PyMOL.
Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH)
Triple-color FISH was used to simultaneously assess the copy number of chromosomes 4 and 8 (that frequently displayed LOH and
appeared to be haploid in our cohort), and of chromosome 7 (which always preserved heterozygosity, and was frequently present in
either a diploid or a tetraploid state). Triple-color FISH was performed on interphase nuclei from 5-mm sections of parafﬁn-embedded
tumor tissue, following the Vysis manufacturer’s protocol, and using probes for PDGFRA (Kreatech Red, Leica Biosystems) to
evaluate chromosome 4, EGFR (Vysis Spectrum Green, Abbot Molecular) speciﬁc for chromosome 7, and CEP8 (Vysis Spectrum
Aqua, Abbott Molecular) corresponding to centromere 8. FISH analysis was pursued to determine absolute chromosomal copy
numbers in tumor cells, however, the evaluation of hybridization results is complicated due to the nuclear truncation occurring in
tissue sections. To validate the method, we performed FISH on a subset of tumors spanning the three main ploidy classes identiﬁed
by ABSOLUTE: 5 ‘‘diploid’, 5 ‘‘near-haploid’’, and 2 ‘‘complex’’ cases (VFISH validation cohort, Figure S3).
Imaging Flow Cytometry and Gating Strategy
Disaggregated nuclei for ﬂow cytometry were prepared from formalin ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded samples per protocol (Hyytinen et al.,
1994) with minor modiﬁcations. Two 50 mM sections for each tumor were deparafﬁnized in xylenes and rehydrated in an ethanol
series ending in dH20. Samples were digested in Carlsberg protease (Proteinase type VIII, Sigma Aldrich), 0.1% in 0.1M Tris/
0.07 M NaCl, for one hour at 37C with frequent agitation and vortexing to release nuclei. The nuclear suspension was separated
from undigested material and clumps by either ﬁltration or repeated standing/decanting/rinsing. The ﬁnal suspension was centri-
fuged and resuspended in 70% ice cold ethanol for 24 hrs. Cells were washed in PBS then incubated in 20ug/mL Propidium Iodide
(PI) (Sigma P-4170) in PBS plus 1 mg/mL Type IIa Ribonuclease-A (Sigma R-5000) for 15 minutes at RT and then ﬁltered using 35 uM
cell strainers (BD Falcon 352235) and run on a SORP 8 laser LSRII. Events were ﬁrst gated on FSC-H vs SSC-A (log). PI-A vs PI-H for
doublet correction. PI intensity was measured using PI-A. For imaging ﬂow cytometry, 50k event (RIF) ﬁles were collected on an
Amnis ImageStream MKII Imaging Flow Cytometer (Amnis EMD Millipore, now a part of Sigma) using INSPIRE (v.200.1.388.0)
Data Acquisition software. Data was collected using a Brightﬁeld (BF) Area histogram gate < 50 microns2 to gate out beads and
small debris, plus a low stringency BF Gradient RMS histogram gate <35 to gate out any out of focus events due to potential clogs

or bubbles. 5 mW 488 nm laser power was used to illuminate PI and 2mW 785nm laser power was used for side scatter (SSC). Data
analysis was performed using IDEAS 6.2.64.0 software. A hierarchical gating strategy was used to identify PI positive, single cell
nuclei as a parent population for the analysis. Comparison of various stringencies of the gating hierarchy (ALL; PI positive; single cells
by Area vs. Aspect ratio of PI; with/without gating out saturated events by Raw Max Pixel of PI) showed no appreciable shift in
the modal PI intensity peak. The higher stringency gating enriched the overall percent of events under the peak (see Supplemental
Information). Representative images were chosen from (+/- 500) of the modal PI intensity peak. PI Intensity and Raw Max Pixel
measurements used a Combined Mask (MC). Mean Pixel PI values used a Ch03 Morphology Mask. Area BF measurements used
a Ch09 AdaptiveErode 95% mask.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Nuclear Mutation Signiﬁcance Analysis
Mutational signiﬁcance analysis was performed using the combination of three MutSig tools (MutSig2CV): (i) MutSigCV (Lawrence
et al., 2013) to detect genes with increased burden of mutations by comparing the number of non-silent mutations to the number
that is expected by chance; (ii) MutSigCL (Lawrence et al., 2014) to detect genes with clustering of mutations along the gene
sequence that is unlikely by chance; (iii) MutSigFN (Lawrence et al., 2013) to detect genes with mutations that are enriched in likely
functional positions identiﬁed by evolutionary conservation. To detect candidate cancer genes p values using Fisher’s p value
combination were integrated. We corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing and identiﬁed candidate cancer genes as those with Ben-
jamini-Hochberg False Discovrey Rate (BH FDR) q-value % 0.1. We used an approach of aggregated tumors that represent the union
of unique SNVs and indels found across all tumors from one individual for analyzing mutational signiﬁcance. In addition, we used
restricted hypothesis testing using a panel of 326 previously published cancer genes (Forbes et al., 2017; Lawrence et al., 2014),
to identify additional recurrently mutated genes. Sample size and description of signiﬁcance testing can be found in the results sec-
tion. To test if tumor suppressor mutations were enriched in cases with widespread chromosomal loss, a Fisher’s exact test was used
on data from each patient where chromosomal state was determined by the degree of LOH (<20 or >20 arms) and each patient was
counted as an event if at least one TS mutation was present.
mtDNA Mutation Signiﬁcance Analysis
Prevalence comparisons between our cohort and the pan-cancer analysis were calculated as the percent of samples having at least
one somatic mutation VAFR0.3 in each category (e.g. non-silent mutation in complex I). The mutation rate between HCC and the
pan-cancer cohort was compared using a heteroscedastic two-sided t-test. Enrichment analysis for protein-modifying mutations
between HCC and the pan-cancer cohort was done using a Fisher’s Exact Test. Enrichment for protein-modifying alterations in
complex I genes was based on a two-sided test of proportions. VAF comparisons for complex I variants between HCC and the
pan-cancer samples were made using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. Sample size, mean and median designations, error
bar deﬁnitions, and p values for all mtDNA data can be found in Figure 4 and its legend.
Quantiﬁcation of FISH Results
At least 50 nuclei per sample were assessed and scored for the number of FISH signals present for each targeted chromosome in a
blinded fashion. To enrich for whole nuclei (i.e. minimize scoring of truncated nuclei), FISH assessment focused on nuclei that: (1) had
at least one signal corresponding to each individual probe, and (2) had a minimum of 2 signals for at least one of the probes. FISH
analysis was then extended to tumors with Allelic CapSeq data consistent with massive LOH and either ‘‘near-haploid’’ or ‘‘complex’’
genomes. In Figure S3, the chr 4: chr 7: chr 8 FISH signal ratio was used to distinguish tumors displaying a near-haploid (NH) genome
(1:2:1 ratio), from samples arising from a NH tumor that had undergone Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) (2:4:2 ratio).
Kaplan-Meier Analysis
Cumulative survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method; curves were compared with the log-rank test. Patients
were classiﬁed as having widespread LOH if at least 9 chr arms had undergone LOH.

Figure S1, related to Figure 1.  (A) HCC samples are summarized for each patient. Purple shading 
indicates the presence of a tumor sample, either primary, distant metastasis, and/or locoregional 
recurrence, for that patient.  Grey color indicates no sample was present.  Numbers indicate quantities 
of sequenced samples; primary samples are differentiated into widely invasive primaries (WIP), 
minimally invasive primaries (MIP) and adenoma (ADE) according to the pathological report.  (B) The 
somatic mutation frequency is shown for HCC and papillary thyroid carcinoma cases (annotated as PTC) 
on logarithmic scale.  Primary samples (P) are divided into widely invasive primaries (WIP) and minimally 
invasive primaries (MIP); two adenoma cases were omitted. Distant metastases (DM; dark purple) and 
locoregional recurrences (LR; light purple) were grouped together.  The median is depicted; the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for differences.  (C) The CoMutPlot is grouped according to 
cluster of nuclear mutations identified.  Ploidy results of FISH and Imaging Flow Cytometry (Flow) are 
indicated by letters for near-haploid (H), diploid (D), and complex (C) tumors.  The presence of WGD is 
depicted. Each column represents one tumor; black vertical lines separate different patients and white

vertical lines separate tumors from the same individual. Below, nuclear mutations and mtDNA 
mutations in complex I and tRNA genes (mtDNA complex I*) as well as TERT promoter mutations are 
shown.  White stars indicate the presence of LOH in the second allele (i.e., biallelic inactivation).  White 
boxes show tumors with insufficient DNA coverage for analysis. 
 
 

 
 
Figure S2, related to Figure 2.  Clonal focal copy number changes of oncogenes and tumor suppressor 
genes are delineated by their genomic position along the 22 chromosomes (top to bottom).  Alterations 
are indicated by rectangles that cover the chromosomes in which alterations have been identified.  
Sample identifiers and classifications are shown at top with purple shading indicating the tumor type 
(first row).  Each column represents one tumor with dark grey vertical lines separating different patients, 
and white vertical lines separating tumors from the same individual.  Letters indicate the minimally 
invasive (M) vs widely invasive (W) primary samples as well as adenomas (A).  Patients are ordered 
according to mean ploidy of ‘aggregated tumors’ (second row), and individual tumor samples from the 
same patient are ordered based on date of resection.  Ploidy results of FISH and Imaging Flow Cytometry 
(Flow) are indicated by letters for near-haploid (H), diploid (D), and complex (C) tumors.  Colors indicate 
loss or gain at a genomic locus. Note this figure depicts only focal copy number events.

Figure S3, related to Figure 3.  (A) Summary of FISH Results.  Left panel, copy numbers of chromosomes 
4, 7 and 8 are depicted as the median and average (of at least 50 nuclei).  The most prevalent FISH result 
in each cell population (Top Call) and its relative frequency is also shown.  Right panel, the distribution of 
chr 4, chr 7, and chr 8 probe counts in representative examples of near-Haploid (HCC-40 P), diploid 
(HCC-43 P), and complex (HCC-81 P) tumors are shown.  The Top Call by FISH and its prevalence is 
marked by an arrow.  (B) Upper panel, frequency distribution histograms of HCC samples from each 
ploidy category obtained by Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC).  All plots show the normalized frequency for 
propidium iodide (PI) intensity of gated single cells.  Horizontal lines in each plot indicate the R4 gated 
population that was selected from the modal PI intensity (value shown in each plot) and verified to 
represent single cells by imaging.  Brightfield and fluorescent images of nuclei are shown in the upper 
right of each histogram with the area (µM2; blue) and mean pixel intensity (yellow) shown along with a 
10 µM scale bar.  Aberrant PI peaks outside the R4 gate in complex/WGD samples represent tissue 
debris visually confirmed by imaging.  Lower panel, summary table of metrics from flow cytometry with 
PI labeling.  All values shown are from the R4 gated population of cells with the exception of the modal 
PI intensity which corresponds to the R3 parent population.   
 
 

 
 
Figure S4, related to Figure 4.  (A) Mean nDNA and mtDNA coverage is shown for tumor and normal 
samples.  For each sample, distribution of different coverage depths is shown for the targeted exome 
and the mitochondrial genome.  Samples are sorted separately for the percent of targeted exome and 
percent of mtDNA panels.  (B) Mutational strand bias in mtDNA in HCC and the ICGC pan-cancer analysis 
with C>T mutations occurring preferentially on the heavy strand and T>C mutations occurring 
preferentially on the light strand.  (C) Barplots show the percent of all protein-modifying somatic 
mutations in complex I subunits according to variant allele fraction (VAF) in HCC compared to the pan-
cancer analysis; two-sided test of proportions.  (D) Protein-modifying variants in complexes III, IV, or V 
do not show higher VAF compared to silent or non-coding variants in HCC and the pan-cancer analysis; 
two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test; ns corresponds to a p value >0.05.

Figure S5, related to Figure 6.  (A) Phylogenetic trees show relationships between distinct tumor 
samples obtained from each patient.  The length of the phylogenetic branches is based on the Jaccard 
distance between clones taking into account clonal nDNA events (CCF≥0.9).  Clonal (black) and subclonal 
(green) gains, losses and oncogenic mutations are annotated onto the branches on which they occurred.  
High VAF complex I mtDNA mutations and TERT promoter mutations were manually added to the trees 
(purple).  The top black dot represents the germline (normal) genome. The initial vertical line from the 
normal genome to the first divergence of the lines depicts events shared by all samples; lines between 
nodes depict events shared among a few; leaves depict events unique to the individual tumors that are

noted at the end. Below each tree, a timeline depicts the sequence of diagnosis and tissue sampling. 
Purple circle for the MT-ND4 variant indicates its presence in DM1, DM2, DM3, DM4, DM5, and DM6, 
but not LR1 and LR2.  (B) Kaplan-Meier curve showing recurrence-free survival (RFS, which includes local 
recurrences and distant metastases) of patients with minimally invasive (MIP, black) and widely invasive 
(WIP, red) primary tumors (n = 26).  Patients were excluded if metastasis was diagnosed at initial 
presentation; only cases with primary tumors analyzed were included.  Mantel-Cox test used to 
determine p value.  (C) Kaplan-Meier curve showing distant metastasis-free survival of patients with MIP 
(black) and WIP (red) primary tumors (n = 29).  Patient were not excluded if metastasis was diagnosed at 
initial presentation.  Bar plots of specific alterations observed in MIP (black) and WIP (red) tumors, n = 
30 (D), and in patients with distant metastases (DM+, blue) versus those without distant metastases 
(DM-, black), n = 30, (E) with nominal p values from Fisher’s exact test above each bar.  (F) Kaplan-Meier 
curve showing RFS based on primary tumors exhibiting widespread chromosomal losses (LOH, blue) and 
those without widespread chromosomal losses (no LOH, black).  The same inclusion criteria as in panel B 
were used. Mantel-Cox test used to determine p value.  (G) Kaplan-Meier curve showing distant 
metastasis-free survival based on primary tumors exhibiting widespread chromosomal losses (LOH; 
blue) and those without widespread chromosomal losses (no LOH; black).  The same inclusion criteria as 
in panel C were used. Mantel-Cox test used to determine p value.
